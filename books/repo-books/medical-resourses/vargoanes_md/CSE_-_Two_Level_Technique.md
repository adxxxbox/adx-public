### CSE – Two Level Technique

  
CSE:(Combined Spinal Epidural)  
**_By Jim Carroll, CRNA_**

The epidural catheter is inserted first and tested to confirm correct catheter placement.  
Then a spinal procedure is performed 1-2 spaces below the epidural (two skin punctures).  
  
**Advantage  
**Ability to test the epidural catheter prior to spinal injection  
  
**Disadvantage  
**Trauma and discomfort resulting from two needle sticks  
  
**How One May Perform a** **CSE –Two Level Technique  
**My CSE labor analgesia procedure consists of a two-level technique as well.  
I place an intrathecal injection at a lower interspace, and then after the patient becomes comfortable, I thread an epidural catheter at a higher interspace.  
  
**Localize  
**I also use buffered 0.5% lidocaine (with NaHCO 3 0.1 mEq/ml) as a local anesthetic infiltration prior to each technique, so pain and burning on infiltration is a non-issue.  
I infiltrate skin and superficial subcutaneous tissue with a 27-gauge 1.5” needle. If I cannot sense ligamentous tissue at the deepest insertion of that needle, I infiltrate deeper using a 25-gauge 3.5” Quincke needle as a deep infiltrator and “sharp palpation” to find the supraspinous ligament, especially when adipose subcutaneous tissue makes palpation of topographic landmarks difficult or impossible. (A few years ago, the MEAN BMI of our OB population was 35, and of the surgical population as a whole, 30).  
  
**My Intrathecal Doses  
**MPF bupivacaine 0.75% without dextrose, 0.4ml = 3 mg  
sufentanil 0.15 ml = 7.5 microgram.  
  
**5mcg Sufenta  
**I used to use sufentanil 10 mcg, and know some providers who use 15 mcg, but a dose-finding study in the literature showed that increasing the dose much beyond 5 mcg increases the incidence of side effects without a concomitant increase in efficacy.  
Since I adopted the above formulation, I have not seen fetal bradycardia or maternal hypotension following ITN injection. This injection produces great analgesia within a few contractions. The parturient is thus reassured that analgesia is a realistic expectation, and the additional benefit is that she can remain calm and immobile and responsive to instructions as to positioning for the epidural placement. A parturient in pain will, in my experience, “writhe” and twist, making the use of a 17-gauge Tuohy as a first approach a questionable approach from a safety standpoint.  
  
**My PCEA Settings  
**My approach to PCEA is to use ropivacaine 0.75% with sufentanil 5 mcg/ml.  
I run a basal rate of 4 ml/hr, a PCA dose of 4 ml, and a lockout interval of 10 min.  
This is a result of a lit search I did a few years ago, which I review about every six months. I have had very few problems using this procedure, and if I fail, I “fail safe.”
