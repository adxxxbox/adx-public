### Argatroban (Acova)

**Class:** Parenteral Direct thrombin inhibitor (selective)  
Argatroban is a non-heparin anticoagulant commonly used as an alternative to Heparin for those patients who cannot receive Heparin e.g patients who have had, or are at risk for, heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).  
  
**Argatroban is a Univalent DTI**  
Univalent DTIs interact with thrombin only at one active site.  
**![](argatroban.png)**  
**Lab Monitoring:** There is no therapeutic drug monitoring widely available for thrombin inhibitors, in contrast with warfarin (INR) and heparin (aPTT).  
The **ecarin clotting time,** although not in general clinical use, would be the most appropriate monitoring test.  
  
**Optional Monitoring in the hospital setting  
aPTT:** infusion of Argatroban up to 40 mcg/kg/min is well correlated with the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).  
**aPTT:** Commonly monitored with IV administration for titration with HIT patients.  
**ACT:** Commonly monitored in selected cardiac procedures (PCIs).  
**INR and PT:** Prolonged, but may not correlate with levels of Argatroban.  
**Thrombin Time:** Usually correlates well with thrombin inhibitors, though this is not well studied.**  
  
Indications:  
**Prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis in patients with HIT.  
Prophylaxis or treatment of coronary artery thrombosis during percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) in patients at risk for HIT.  
  
**Mechanism of Action:  
**Selectively and reversibly binds to thrombin and prevents the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin during the coagulation cascade. Inhibition of fibrinogen conversion to fibrin inhibits thrombus development. Inhibits both free and clot-bound thrombin and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation.  
Argatroban is highly selective for thrombin, and at therapeutic concentrations, argatroban has little or no effect on related serine proteases (trypsin, factor Xa, plasmin, and kallikrein).  
  
**Route:** Parenteral; usually a continuous IV infusion titrated to keep the patient’s aPTT 1.5-2.5 times baseline. Never administer IM.  
**Doses  
For** **thrombocytopenia with** **patients in HIT:** Initial: 2 mcg/kg/min IV continuous infusion  
over 1-3 hours-–titrate aPTT to effect. Maximum dose is 10 mcg/kg/min.  
**Doses for PCI** (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention):  
**Initial:** 25 mcg/kg/min IV infusion after a bolus of 350 mcg/kg IV over 3-5 minutes via large-bore IV line _(see bottom of page for details)._ Titrated with ACT.  
  
**Peds:** Safety and efficacy not established  
  
**Contraindicated:** Avoid use in patients with clinically significant hepatic disease or AST/ALT levels >3 x upper limit of normal.

It is shown to normalize platelet count in patients with HIT and to prevent the formation of thrombi.  
  
**Distribution  
Protein bound:** 54%**Vd:** 174 mL/kg**Metabolism:** Liver-hepatic CYP enzymes  
**Excretion:** Hepatic-biliary excretion  
**T1/2:** 40–50 min  
**T1/2 with hepatic impairment:** ~ 181 minutes  
**Total body clearance:** 5.1 mL/kg/min  
**Excretion:** Feces (65%); urine (22%).  
  
**More Dosing Notes:  
Initial:** 25 mcg/kg/min IV infusion, AND  
A bolus of 350 mcg/kg IV over 3-5 minutes via large-bore IV line.  
Check activated clotting time (ACT) 5-10 minutes after bolus dose is completed; procedure may proceed if ACT is >300 seconds.  
  
If ACT is <300 seconds, administer additional IV bolus dose of 150 mcg/kg, increase infusion dose to 30 mcg/kg/min, and check ACT 5-10 minutes later.  
  
If ACT >450 seconds, decrease infusion rate to 15 mcg/kg/min, and check ACT 5-10 minutes later. After therapeutic ACT (300-450 sec) achieved, continue this infusion dose for duration of procedure.  
  
**Hepatic impairment:**  
Approximately 4-fold decrease in clearance relative to those with normal hepatic function, thus dosing modification is warranted; monitor aPTT and adjust dosage as clinically indicated.  
**Thrombocytopenia;** Decrease initial dose to 0.5 mcg/kg/min IV.  
  
**PCI:** Avoid use in patients with clinically significant hepatic disease or AST/ALT levels >3 x ULN.  
  
**More Notes:  
**The American College of Cardiologists (ACC) recommends using bivalirudin or argatroban in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention who have had, or at risk for, heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
