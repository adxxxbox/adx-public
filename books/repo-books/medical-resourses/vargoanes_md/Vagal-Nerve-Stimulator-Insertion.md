### Vagal Nerve Stimulator (VNS) Insertion

**Indication for VNS:**  
For refractory epilepsy  
Also indicated for some types of medically refractory depression.

The VGS is a device resembling a pacemaker that generates pulses of electricity to stimulate the vagus nerve. The VGS is about the size of a silver dollar.  
  
The device may be programmed to stimulate the nerve for 30 seconds every five minutes around the clock. The patient also is given a hand-held magnet that can be worn like a watch. When the patient feels the onset of a seizure, the magnet should be brought near the stimulator to generate an immediate strong current of electricity to prevent or stop a seizure in progress or reduce the severity of the oncoming seizure.

  
**2 different incisions:  
Neck:** The first incision is done on the left side of the neck at the C6-7 level. The sheath is opened, the jugular vein is retracted laterally, and the vagus nerve is usually noted in the groove between the jugular vein and carotid artery; however, it can be deep and lateral to the carotid artery. The left vagus nerve is then isolated and exposed for around 3-4 cm for the necessary surgery. The electrode assembly is wrapped around the nerve below the origin of the superior and inferior cervical cardiac branches. The distal end is tunneled to connect to the VNS beneath the skin, in the second part of the procedure.  
  
**Left anterior chest wall:** Excision #2 is performed at the left anterior upper part of the chest just below the clavicle. The VNS is inserted just beneath the skin like a pacemaker. A pocket for the pulse generator is developed just above the fascia of the pectoralis muscle.  
  
**Anesthetic:** General/LMA or ETT, usually an LMA. These patients may require more anesthesia if the patient is on anticonvulsant meds, except for levetiracetam. Neuromuscular blockade is usually not done, especially if you are using an LMA. The vagus nerve is not a motor nerve, so it doesn’t twitch when manipulated with a bovie. Ask the surgeon if he or she will need NMB during the case. See _Arrhythmia_ below.  
**Regional:** This is rare, but a superficial and deep cervical plexus block and the surgeon’s local anesthetic field block on the anterior chest wall may be done. 

**Position:** Supine with the arms tucked and the head turned to the right. Make sure your EKG leads are out of the way.  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours.  
**IV Access:** 20g is acceptable. I have seen some colleagues insist on an 18g since there is always a small potential to lacerate the internal jugular vein or carotid artery.  
**EBL:** Minimal.  
**Arrhythmia Concerns:** Yes, for bradycardia and rarely asystole. Always have a syringe of Epinephrine, Atropine and Robinul available when the surgeon is testing the VNS. The surgeon usually warns you before testing. A transcutaneous pacing ability should be available in case of emergency. Even though asystole is very rare, I have still seen some colleagues park the crash cart which has a transcutaneous pacer just outside the OR.

  
**Anticonvulsant meds:** Yes, be aware of which anticonvulsant meds patient is taking. Sometimes these meds are interrupted for the procedure and their seizure threshold level may be lowered. Avoid Demerol and Ketamine. 5mg of Versed and Propofol are common anticonvulsant meds we administer.  
There is conflicting literature concerning Sevoflurane being a pro-convulsant. Isoflurane and Desflurane are well known for having strong anticonvulsant properties.

  
**Complications:**  
Neck hemorrhage: very rare.  
Post op neck hematoma, with possible airway compromise.  
Bradycardia and asystole under test stimulation.  
Transient hoarseness, dysphagia, or torticollis when the VNS is being stimulated. This is not a complication but a common side effect of the VNS. It happens to most all patients who have these stimulators placed. The patients are told to not drink anything during the 30 seconds of stimulation; they may also have trouble with phonation during stimulation as well.    
Vocal Chord issues from direct trauma or manipulation of the vagus nerve. Also inadvertent clamping, heating, traction, or disruption to the blood supply can lead to temporary cord paresis.  
Electrode fracture or malfunction.

Early and late onset deep wound infections.  
Posttraumatic dysfunction of the stimulator.

**More Notes**

**Success rate:** Studies of patients report 50% have good improvement, 25% show some improvement and there is no change with the remaining 25%.  
  
The vagus nerve is one of the 12 cranial nerves. It conducts impulses between the brain and other parts of the brain and various body structures located mostly in the head and neck. It is also the longest of the cranial nerves, extending to organs in the chest and abdomen. It influences many organs and structures, including the larynx, lungs, heart and GI tract.

The VNS is interrogated in a similar manner to a pacemaker, using a programming wand.

Success rate is higher in children compared to adults 

The VNS is NOT placed on the right side because of the number of cardiac efferent branches in the right vagus nerve.

The patient should be ready to inform all future healthcare providers to avoid inserting any central venous catheters in the left internal jugular vein, and also the OR staff should not use any unipolar cautery.

Should external cardiac defibrillation be necessary, use precautions similar to a cardiac pacemaker’s presence.   

**Battery Life**:  
The battery life quoted for devices is 4–6 years, after which it needs to be changed. Current devices may have a longer life of 10 years and can also register the remaining battery energy.

**Review**   
Brain cells communicate by sending electrical signals in an orderly pattern. In people with epilepsy, there is an overexcitement similar to an electrical overload in the brain, which leads to seizures. Seizures can be produced by electrical impulses from throughout the brain. These impulses are called generalized seizures, whereas partial seizures originate in a small area or areas within the brain. 

Most people with epilepsy can control their seizures with anticonvulsant medical therapy. Persons who are NOT considered good candidates for brain surgery or patients who have poor responses to their medications may be candidates for VNS placement. These patients must be referred by their neurologist.

Some patients complain that the magnet is so strong that it can damage a cell phone or computer. This is why many patients don’t wear the bracelets on their wrist but instead wear it around their ankle. If the patient has the magnet with them pre-operatively, remember to keep it away from your phone.
