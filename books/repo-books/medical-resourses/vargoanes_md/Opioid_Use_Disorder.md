Opioid Use Disorder (OUD)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Opioid Use Disorder (OUD)

\- OUD produces euphoria, increasing the odds that people will continue using them despite adverse consequences.  
\- It is a chronic disorder with potentially severe consequences, including disability, relapses, and death.  
\- The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM 5-TR) describes opioid use disorder as a problematic pattern of opioid use leading to problems or distress, with at least two of the following occurring within 12 months:

1.  Taking larger amounts or taking drugs over a longer period than intended.
2.  Persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control opioid use.
3.  Spending a great deal of time obtaining or using the opioid or recovering from its effects.
4.  Craving or a strong desire or urge to use opioids
5.  Problems fulfilling obligations at work, school, or home.
6.  Continued opioid use despite having recurring social or interpersonal problems.
7.  Giving up or reducing activities because of opioid use.
8.  Using opioids in physically hazardous situations, such as driving while under the influence of opiates.
9.  Continued opioid use despite ongoing physical or psychological problems likely caused or worsened by opioids.
10.  Tolerance (i.e., need for increased amounts or diminished effect with continued use of the same amount)
11.  Experiencing withdrawal (opioid withdrawal syndrome) or taking opioids (or a closely related substance) to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms

**Prevalence and facts:**

-   1 million Americans suffer from OUD
-   8% of surgical patients on chronic opioids
-   Fentanyl is 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine.
-   According to the American Medical Association (AMA), an estimated 3% to 19% of people who take prescription pain medications develop an addiction.
-   People misusing opioids may try to switch from prescription painkillers to heroin when it is more readily available.
-   About 45% of people who use heroin started with an addiction to prescription opioids, according to the AMA.

**Why Pain Management is difficult in OUD:**

-   Opioid tolerance leads to desensitization and downregulation of opioid receptors
-   Frequent exposure to opioids leads to counteradaptation, altering neurotransmitter response in pain pathway
    -   This neuroadaptive response leads to tolerance, allodynia, & hyperalgesia
-   Opioid Paradox: larger doses used intraoperatively increases opioid requirements postoperatively, leading to an inaccurate increase in dosing by anesthesia providers
-   The lack of formal OUD management training for anesthesia providers is a barrier to providing optimal anesthetic care to this population

**Comorbidities/Sequela Associated with OUD:**

-   HTN
-   Dilated cardiomyopathy
-   GERD reduced gastric motility  Aspiration risk
-   Anxiety/depression caution for concomitant drug abuse
-   Other: Difficult IV access, risk of infectious disease (hepatitis, HIV)
-   Increased hospital stays and adverse outcomes  
      
    

**Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD):  
**Three U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications are commonly used to treat opioid use disorder.

**Methadone:**  
It prevents withdrawal symptoms and reduces cravings in people with OUD. It does not cause a euphoric feeling once patients become tolerant to its effects. It is available only in specially regulated clinics.  
  
**Buprenorphine (Subutex):**  
It partially blocks the effects of other opioids, displaces current opioids in the body, and reduces or eliminates withdrawal symptoms and cravings. Buprenorphine treatment (detoxification or maintenance) is provided by specially trained and qualified clinicians who have received a waiver from the DEA).  
  
**Buprenorphine-Naloxone (Suboxone):**  
As stated above, buprenorphine partially blocks the effects of opioids. Suboxone combines buprenorphine with naloxone (see below) to prevent accidental or intentional use to get high.

**Buprenorphine extended-release (Sublocade):**  
A once-a-month injection of buprenorphine is available to individuals who have shown tolerance to oral buprenorphine.

**Naltrexone:**  
Blocks the effects of other opioids preventing the feeling of euphoria. It is available from office-based providers in pill form or monthly injections.
