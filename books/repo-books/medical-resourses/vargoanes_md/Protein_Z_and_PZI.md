### Protein Z and PZI

In recent years, **protein Z** (PZ) and protein Z dependent protease **inhibitor (ZPI),** have been added to the list of prothrombotic factors.  
PZ circulates in plasma in a complex with ZPI.  
  
**PZ plasma half-life:** 2-3 days  
Protein Z is a vitamin K–dependent protein. It is also sensitive to warfarin.  
  
**Function of Protein Z  
**The function of PZ is still unclear to date. It has been reported that it **INACTIVATES** factor Xa by forming a Ca dependent complex with factor Xa with the help of ZPI on the phospholipid surfaces (mediates thrombin adhesion to phospholipids and stimulates degradation of factor X by ZPI).  
Factor IXa has also been reported to be a target for the protein Z/ZPI system.  
  
**Protein Z Deficiency**  
Early literature suggests that a deficiency of PZ levels is associated with a mild bleeding tendency. This has never been proven. It is now believed that a deficiency predisposes to venous thrombosis (mainly in patients with other clotting abnormalities).
