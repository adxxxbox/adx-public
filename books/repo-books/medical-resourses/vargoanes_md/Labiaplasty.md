**Several labiaplasty techniques are utilized:**  
De-epithelialization  
Direct excision  
Wedge resection  
Composite reduction  
  
The technique is irrelevant to anesthesia because most procedures involve general anesthesia using LMA.  
The surgeon will infiltrate the area with local anesthetic and perform the procedure with the patient is in lithotomy position.  
  
**Anesthesia:** Usually general with LMA, rarely ETT unless indicated.  
**Regional:** Spinal is possible, but rare for this procedure.
