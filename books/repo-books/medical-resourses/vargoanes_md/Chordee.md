### Chordee Repair

  
_By Justin Flesher, CRNA_  

Chordee is a congenital defect resulting from abnormal development of the penis. The penis usually curves downward and the condition may not even be noticed until there is an erection. Many times, a chordee is associated with hypospadias.  
When hypospadias is not present, chordee may often go undetected until late childhood or adulthood.

**Short summary of the surgical procedure:**  
A surgery to straighten out the penis.  
Preferred time of surgery is between 6-18 months of age.

**Description of Procedure**  
Several techniques may be used to straighten the penis.  
In general, surgery aims to make the longer and shorter sides of the penis equal in length.

**Techniques may include:**  
Removing tissue that is constricting the erection.  
Making the longer and shorter sides of the penis equal in length.  
Lengthening the urethra, if the urethra is short—tissue from the foreskin or another site will be used.

**Short summary describing the anesthesia:**  
Ask the surgeon how long the procedure will be. If it is long, consider an ETT; otherwise LMA is acceptable.

**Pre-op:**  
Are there any cardiac issues or other defects?  
Does the patient already have an IV?  
Any recent URIs?

**Anesthetic:** General (ETT or LMA) with a caudal is very popular.  
Some pediatric urologists perform a penile block at the  
end of the case instead of a caudal.  
**Airway issues:** LMA vs ETT. Usually avoid LMA in < 7kg patients.  
**Regional-Caudal:** 1ml/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine  
**Induction:** Mask  
**Nitrous:** Optional  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Not needed  
**Narcotics:** Not needed if there is a caudal .  
**Position:** Supine, typically moved toward the foot of OR table.  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours, depending on whether hypospadias is involved  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 22 g  
**Age Range:** 6-18 months  

**Hydration:**  
Recall the 4:2:1 ratio.  
LR OR NS  
**(Below is just a common reference):**  
Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc/kg)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
3rd Spacing: 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss with an open belly case.

**EBV** (reference)  
**Premature:** 90-100cc/kg  
**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg  
**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg  
**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg    
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**Emergence:** May extubate ETT or LMA while the patient is deep.  
Ketorolac, if ok with surgeon.

**Possible Complications:**   
Urethrocutaneous fistula  
Recurrent chordee  
Bleeding  
Shortened penis  
Infection  
Psychological trauma
