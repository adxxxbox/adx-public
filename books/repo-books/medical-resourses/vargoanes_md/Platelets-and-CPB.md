### Thrombocytopenia and Platelet Dysfunction with CPB

**Thrombocytopenia can occur after CPB due to:**  
Dilution from the bypass crystalloid.  
Consumption and sequestration of platelets.  
Platelet dysfunction is the main hemostatic defect during CABG.  
  
**Causes of Platelet Dysfunction:**  
Contact with the extracorporeal surfaces.  
Hypothermia.  
Down-regulation of receptors.  
Exposure to heparin and protamine.  
Antithrombotic meds given pre-op produce exaggerated platelet dysfunction after surgery.  
  
(Pre-op) platelet dysfunction is really exaggerated from these meds postoperatively.  
  
Many patients taking aspirin and other platelet inhibiting drugs regularly cannot discontinue therapy within 7 days of scheduled surgery. Unfortunately there is no antidote that corrects platelet dysfunction.  
These patients may require multiple transfusions and/or procoagulant factor therapy. Because of this, platelets are often required at the end of the case following weaning from bypass.  
  
Platelet count may be artificially low because platelets are sequestered in the portal circulation during cardiopulmonary bypass. Following rewarming, platelet count reverts to more normal levels.
