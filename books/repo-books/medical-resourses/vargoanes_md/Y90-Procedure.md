### Y90 (90Yttrium) Procedure

Review write-up on MAA procedure; it is the first part of a 2 part procedure that is usually done 1-2 weeks apart.

Like the MAA procedure, most of these Y90 cases are done under conscious sedation.

Our anesthesia services are requested if the patient cannot remain still. For us, this is a basic anesthesia procedure done in Intervention Radiology. We usually intubate and maintain muscle relaxation. An A-Line is not indicated.

Most facilities prefer treating cases where liver function is not severely deteriorated. 

Many of these patients seem to have a primary colon related cancer.    

**Goal of Y90:** Destroy hepatic tumor cells while sparing surrounding liver tissue.  

Improve the quality of life and the life span.

Indication: Nonresectable primary and metastatic liver cancers.

Anesthesia wise, this procedure is similar to the MAA procedure but usually shorter in duration. The Intervention Radiologist will insert a Femoral Catheter and guide it down to the Hepatic Artery under fluoroscopy. 90Yttrium labeled resin microspheres are infused into the hepatic artery and they lodge primarily in the tumor microvasculature.  Many pictures are taken throughout the procedure and the case is complete. After extubation, the patient goes to PACU.

Anesthetic: General/ETT  
Most of these are just conscious sedation without anesthesia being involved.

**Muscle Relaxation:** Yes, no movement is recommended. Also, you will be asked multiple times to “Stop Ventilation” during injections for image taking, so you do not want the patient breathing. Same principle as an “Aortogram Runoff”.

**Duration:**1-3 hours.  
**IV Access:** 20G  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**Positioning:** Supine with arms tucked.  

**Possible Complications:**  
Hemorrhage-very rare.  
Vascular Injury.  
Pseudoaneurysm at the Femoral Artery puncture site.  
Gastrointestinal ulceration.  
Postradioembolization syndrome (PRS).  
Hepatic dysfunction.  
Biliary complications-Cholecystitis and/or biliary stricture.  
Portal Hypertension.  
Radiation Pneumonitis.  
Lymphopenia  
Contrast dye allergic reaction.  

**More Notes:**  
The microspheres themselves are made of glass or resin. Inside the microspheres is the isotope yttrium-90, which has beta emission with a half-life of 2.6 days. 

The treatment combines arterial micro-embolization with high-dose interstitial radiotherapy. 90Yttrium is a beta emitter with a half-life of 64.1 hours with an average energy of 0.94 MeV. This corresponds to a maximum range of 1.1 cm within tissue with a mean path of 2.5 mm.

**Local Radiation:**<  
Microspheres target liver tumors by taking advantage of their hypervascularity. Metastatic liver tumors larger than 3 mm receive 80% to 100% of their blood supply from the hepatic artery while normal liver tissue is predominantly fed by the portal vein. The microspheres are delivered via a fluoroscopic embolization procedure in which millions of 30-micron beads are infused through a catheter into the hepatic artery. The beads become embedded in the liver, and the therapeutic dose is delivered over a period of about two weeks. The beads are bonded with yttrium-90 (Y-90), a beta-emitting radionuclide that acts locally.  Its relatively low energy means the beta particles travel at most 11 mm in the liver. This allows the beads to embed in and irradiate the tumor while sparing healthy liver tissue.

Treatment is typically performed in separate sessions for each affected lobe of the liver. Some patients have bilateral disease, so in the second session one lobe is treated and in a separate third session, the other lobe is done.

Many such patients have failed chemotherapy and are not candidates for external beam radiation. Patient toleration is by and large excellent.

Many of these patients experience a lack of energy; some of them experience some right upper-quadrant tightness or pain. Many patients develop a fever and others experience a loss of appetite, but these are typically mild and transient.
