### Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery

First the patient is positioned under GETA. A C-arm is used to determine the location of the operative site and marked with a marker. A small incision is made and tubular dilators are inserted into a safe position.  
Using the assistance of a C-arm and EMG nerve monitoring, the surgeon will safely advance the dilator to the correct area. Then a tissue retractor is advanced over the dilators and the dilators are then removed. The retractor is locked to the surgical table and held open to provide lighted visibility and surgical access to the disc space. The surgeon then proceeds.

_You will see a bunch of long thick rods and skinny probes sticking out of the patient’s back._

These cases take longer than an open procedure, but there is markedly less tissue trauma and blood loss.

**Anesthesia**: General, ETT.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Usually, unless there is EMG monitoring.  
**EBL:** <100 mLs  
**Duration:** Depends on the procedure.  
**EMG Monitoring:** Usually  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
**Antibiotics:** Usually Ancef, unless contraindicated.  
  
Traditional, open spine surgery involves cutting or stripping the muscles from the spine. A minimally invasive approach preserves the surrounding muscular and vascular function and minimizes scarring. So there are a few small incisions versus one large traumatic one.
