Prebypass-Hemodynamics    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Recommended Hemodynamics

**Pre-bypass hemodynamics:**  
Maintain blood pressure within +/- 20% of baseline pressure. Heart rate between 40-80bpm usually acceptable prior to bypass depending on the clinical situation. Systolic blood pressure should be less than 100mmHg for initial bypass.  
  
**Bypass hemodynamics:**  
The perfusionists maintiain mean arterial pressure between 40-80mmHg during the cold period of bypass (cross clamp on) and between 60-80mmHg during warm bypass (cross clamp off). There are always exceptions. A patient with carotid vascular disease or chronic renal insufficiency may need higher pressures - (60-80 mmHg) for the entire pump run.  
  
**Post-bypass hemodynamics:**  
**Avoid hypertension; this can cause graft disruption.**  
  
Consult the surgeon requiring individual requirements.  
  
Systolic blood pressure > 80mmHg is acceptable; 100-120 better; > 120 is undesirable because of increased risk for bleeding or challenging the anastomosis of the new grafts.  
  
Cardiac Index CI => 2.0 is acceptable.  
  
PA Diastolic < 20  
  
**CVP < 15**  
  
Central venous pressure greater than pulmonary artery end diastolic pressure indicates a problem. This could be due to poor calibration or right ventricular failure. If hypotension occurs, suspect manipulation of the heart in the case of an open chest. Cardiac tamponade must be considered if the chest is closed.  
  
HR = 60-100
