Neuraxial Opioids with OB    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Neuraxial Opioids with OB

Clinical guidelines recommend using a mixture of local anesthetic plus a strong opioid to improve the analgesic effect, minimize adverse effects.  
Sometimes an opioid alone, typically morphine, can be administered to provide a long period of postoperative analgesia for up to 24 hours. This is why we usually dose an epidural with a few milligrams of morphine after a C-section right before we pull the catheter.  
  
**The 3 neuraxial opioids we will discuss are:**  
BF Morphine (Duramorph or Astromorph)  
Fentanyl  
Sufenta  
  
**Terms to know  
Lipophilic** \= Highly lipid soluble, means rapid onset, having a strong affinity for lipids.  
**Hydrophilic =** having a tendency to dissolve in water. Slow onset and not lipid friendly.  
  
**Intrathecal (Spinal) Opioids  
Can bind to opioid receptors in three different areas to produce analgesia  
**1) Substantia Gelatinosa (Rexed’s Lamina II) in the Dorsal Horn-have direct access and it is their  
main source of action. The release of substance P is reduced and the transmission of impulses  
through the Substantia Gelatinosa is inhibited.  
2) They are also transported supra-spinally by CSF flow where they modulate descending  
inhibitory pain pathways.  
3) A small amount diffuses into the epidural space and systemically absorbed and resulting in  
centrally mediated analgesia (minor effect).  
  
**Intrathecal Metabolism of Opioid**  
Opioids have minimal metabolism in the CSF  
  
**What depends on intrathecal Lipid Solubility  
**The onset and duration of analgesia  
Degree of cephalad spread  
  
**Lipophilic Opioids  
Fentanyl and Sufenta** are highly lipid soluble (lipophilic) and diffuse into the spinal cord and bind to the dorsal horn receptors rapidly. This produces a rapid onset of analgesia with minimal cephalad spread and subsequently a low risk of delayed respiratory depression, however the duration of analgesia is relatively short.  
  
**Intrathecal Lipophilic Opioids and Respiratory** **Depression**  
Fentanyl or Sufenta will occur within 2 hours due to significant systemic uptake from the blood vessels within the spinal cord.  
  
**Hydrophilic Opioid  
Morphine** is poorly lipid soluble (hydrophilic) and is much slower to bind dorsal horn opioid receptors resulting in a slower onset but more prolonged duration of analgesia, increased cephalad spread, and subsequently an increased risk of delayed respiratory depression.  
  
**Intrathecal Hydrophilic Opioids and Respiratory Depression  
Morphine** or any other hydrophilic opioid has an increased risk of delayed respiratory depression. Early respiratory depression does not occur because the systemic circulation/absorption in the CSF is minimal. Cephalic (rostral) spread of an overabundance of morphine trapped in the CSF will circulate the brainstem and cause a delayed respiratory depression in 6-12 hours.  
  
**Epidural Opioids  
**After epidural administration of an opioid (depending on which one is used) it will diffuse across the dura and arachnoid mater into the subarachnoid space to bind opioid receptors in the Substantia Gelatinosa within the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.  
Lipid solubility is the most important factor affecting the rate of diffusion, onset and duration of analgesia.  
Lipophilic opioids such as fentanyl and sufentanil diffuse rapidly across the dura into the CSF compared to hydrophilic opioids such as morphine.  
  
Lipophilic opioids injected per Epidural will produce rapid onset of analgesia which is of short overall duration.  
  
**After epidural delivery, CSF opioid levels will peak:**  
Sufenta-6 minutes  
Fenatnyl-20 minutes  
Morphine-1-4 hours  
  
Unlike the subarachnoid space, the epidural space is extremely vascular with the epidural venous plexus. There is a significance of absorption of opioids into the systemic circulation. Epidural administration of Sufenta, Fentanyl and Morphine produces plasma levels of opioid similar to those seen after IM injections of similar doses.  
  
**Central Mediated Anesthesia**  
Systemic opioids also reach the CNS and bind to the receptors in areas of the brain that modulate pain perception and response. Centrally mediated analgesia after systemic absorption is an important mechanism of analgesia for epidural opioids.  
  
Since Sufenta and Fentanyl are lipophilic and absorbed most rapidly, they are more likely to cause respiratory depression than Morphine.  
  
**Peak Plasma Levels of Opioids after Epidural Administration  
**Sufenta < 5 minutes  
Fentanyl 5-10 minutes  
Morphine 10-15 minutes
