-   Concomitant or pre-administration of an adequate dose of an anticholinergic agent (glycopyrrolate or atropine) can prevent the cholinergic adverse effects of neostigmine.

-   Neostigmine is more popular than Edrophonium because of its longer duration.
-   Neostigmine works at the acetylcholine esterase site.
-   Edrophonium works at the anionic site.

Neostigmine mechanism of action at the neuromuscular junction:

-   Neostigmine produces reversible inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme by forming a carbamylated ester at the esteratic site.
-   A carbamylated acetylcholinesterase cannot hydrolyze acetylcholine until the carbamylated enzyme bond dissociates.
-   This permits a massive accumulation of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction.
-   This drastically improves the chances of 2 acetylcholine molecules to displace the muscle relaxant by binding to the alpha subunits of the nicotinic cholinergic receptors.
-   Thus, reversing paralysis and restoring neuromuscular transmission.
-   Carbamylated acetylcholinesterase has a half-life of about 15-30 minutes.
-   That is why the half-life of neostigmine is about 30 minutes.

Unfortunately, neostigmine affects other parasympathetic receptors beyond the targeted nicotinic receptors of the neuromuscular junction.

Neostigmine also indirectly activates parasympathetic muscarinic receptors.

-   Neostigmine itself does not bind to the muscarinic receptors to trigger a response.
-   The buildup of acetylcholine (from inhibiting acetylcholinesterase) will produce its cholinergic effects peripherally in the parasympathetic nervous system.

There are five types of muscarinic receptors (1-5) throughout the parasympathetic system.

**Muscarinic 2 (M2) receptors:** Located in the heart

**M3 receptors:** Located in the GI system, glands, and eyes.

Muscarinic receptors in the Central Nervous System (CNS):

Neostigmine also DOES NOT indirectly activate muscarinic receptors in the brain and CNS because it is a quaternary amine, which prevents it from crossing the blood-brain barrier.

The M2 receptors of the heart:

-   Located predominantly in the heart, acting on the SA and AV nodes, atria, and ventricles.
-   Activated cardiac M2 receptors result in vagal effects, causing Brady dysrhythmias, ventricular escape beats, and possibly asystole.
-   The anticholinergic drugs (atropine or glycopyrrolate) selectively block the effects of acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptors of the heart.
-   This prevents bradycardia.
-   At the same time, it does not affect the responses to acetylcholine at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.

Neostigmine and heart transplant patients:

Neostigmine can cause asystole with a denervated heart (heart transplant).

Anticholinergic agents (glycopyrrolate, atropine) will not effectively treat or counter the bradycardia with a denervated heart.

GI and lungs - via M3 receptor:

Widely distributed in smooth muscles (like those in the bladder and digestive tract), exocrine and endocrine glands, and the lungs.

**Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and increased gas.

**Respiratory:** Increased oral, pharyngeal, and bronchial secretions (saliva and mucus), as well as bronchospasm.

**Neuromuscular:** Muscle cramps, spasms, and twitching.

**Ocular:** Pinpoint pupils and blurred vision.

**Other:** Increased sweating, flushing, and increased urinary frequency.

Cholinergic crisis:

-   The possibility of iatrogenic overdose can be lessened by carefully monitoring the muscle twitch response to peripheral nerve stimulation.
-   An overdose of neostigmine can lead to a cholinergic crisis that results from the overstimulation of muscarinic receptors.
-   Symptoms mimic a myasthenic crisis, such as extreme muscle weakness, excessive GI secretions and diarrhea.
-   This is also known as a "SLUDGE effect."
-   A cholinergic crisis requires immediate discontinuation of anticholinergics and administration of atropine.
-   Assistance of ventilation may be required.

Myasthenic crisis vs cholinergic crisis:

-   Myasthenic crisis, due to an increase in the severity of the disease, is also accompanied by extreme muscle weakness, and may be difficult to distinguish from cholinergic crisis on a symptomatic basis.
-   The two types of crises may be differentiated by the use of edrophonium chloride as well as by clinical judgment.
-   Treatment of the two conditions differs radically.

The specific SLUDGE effects of neostigmine:

-   Salivation and Sweating
-   Lacrimation
-   Urination
-   Defecation/Diarrhea
-   GI Upset
-   Emesis

Inadequate muscle relaxant reversal with neostigmine and recurarization:

-   Neostigmine cannot effectively reverse deep levels of a neuromuscular block, as seen with a 0 twitches with TOF.
-   A full dose of neostigmine may temporarily reverse the patient enough to appear extubatable.
-   However, with the waning effect of neostigmine's inhibition on acetylcholinesterase, the remains of the circulating nonmetabolized nondepolarizing muscle relaxant may competitively reattach to the nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junctions (recurarization).
-   This will result in muscle weakness.
-   Patients may complain of not being able to breathe with increased anxiety.
-   200 mg of sugammadex is the treatment of choice.

Recurarization:

-   It is well documented in rare cases that a patient in the recovery room will be breathing satisfactorily after reversal with neostigmine and tracheal extubation, may subsequently developed respiratory distress and required reintubation.

Possible reasons for inadequate reversal with neostigmine resulting in Recurarization

-   **Block remains too deep:** 0 twitches
-   **Peak effect time:** Neostigmine takes time (up to 10 minutes) to achieve its peak effect. This limits its ability to produce rapid recovery.
-   **Inadequate dose:** Insufficient dose for the level of the blockade present.
-   **Incorrect Timing:** Administering neostigmine too late in the recovery process, after a near-complete recovery has already occurred, which can lead to over-sensitization.
-   **Recurarization:** Patients can develop increasing muscle weakness again after apparent recovery due to the waning effect of neostigmine and the NMBA.

**3-hydroxyphenyldimethyl amine (3-HPDMA):** Research in rats has identified this metabolite, which is a demethylated form of neostigmine.

**Unidentified metabolites:** Studies have also detected small amounts of other unidentified metabolites in the urine of test subjects.

Neostigmine and PONV:

-   There is no evidence that neostigmine increases PONV.
-   According to Stoelting's 2022 Pharmacology and Physiology in Anesthesia Practice (p. 322), neostigmine has been described as having antiemetic properties.

Inadequate muscle relaxant reversal with neostigmine resulting in recurarization

-   It is well documented that patients were breathing satisfactorily in the recovery room after reversal with neostigmine and tracheal extubation, then suddenly developed respiratory distress and needed re-intubation.
-   This is from a phenomenon known as recurarization.
-   This is the result of the inadequate dosing of the neuromuscular muscle relaxant reversal agent.
-   Neostigmine's inhibition of acetylcholinesterase wanes off in about 30 minutes.
-   The redistribution of remaining unbound nonmetabolized muscle relaxant may reattach to the nicotinic receptors resulting in muscle weakness.

Possible causes of Recurarization:

Inadequate neostigmine dosage:

-   The dosage of neostigmine is based on the level of the block.
-   Neostigmine has a ceiling effect and is not effective for reversing deep neuromuscular blockade.

Inadequate timing of reversal:

-   Neostigmine takes up to 10 minutes for reversal.
-   Administering neostigmine when the blockade is too deep increases the risk of inadequate reversal and subsequent recurarization.
-   It is most effective when spontaneous recovery has already begun.

Use of long-acting neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs):

-   Drugs with a long duration of action are associated with a greater risk of recurarization.
-   The NMBA can redistribute from peripheral tissues back to the central compartment after effects of neostigmine on acetylcholinesterase have waned, renewing the blockade.
-   The long-acting NMBA pancuronium is no longer available in most US hospital pharmacies.

Medications that potentiate NMBAs or interfere with the effect of neostigmine.

Magnesium

Aminoglycoside antibiotics

Lack of judgment with neuromuscular monitoring:

Neostigmine should not be administered with zero twitches with TOF.
