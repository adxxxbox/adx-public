### Laparoscopy

Laparoscopy or “minimally invasive surgery” (MIS) is a specialized technique for performing surgery. In the past, traditional “open” surgery using a large single incision was made to enter into the abdomen.  
Today, laparoscopic surgery only uses 0.5-1cm incisions. Each incision is called a “port.”  At each port, a trochar is inserted.  Other specialized instruments and a camera known as a laparoscope are passed through the trochars during the procedure. The abdominal contents are then visualized and displayed on a high definition screen.  
  
The laparoscopic system allows the surgeon to perform the same operations as traditional “open” surgery but with smaller incisions. Sometimes a surgeon may make a larger incision just enough to insert a hand. When a hand port is used, the surgical technique is called “hand assisted” laparoscopy. 

Because of the smaller incision used with laparoscopy, the patients often experience less pain, require less narcotics, less incisional hernias occurrences, a shorter recovery, and less scarring with laparoscopic surgery.  
  
**Pneumoperitoneum is required**  
Laparoscopic surgery involves insufflation of a gas carbon dioxide into the peritoneal cavity producing a pneumoperitoneum. This causes an increase in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP).

  
**Insufflation Pressures**  
Carbon dioxide is insufflated into the peritoneal cavity at a rate of 4–6 liters/ min to a pressure of 10–20 mmHg. The pneumoperitoneum is maintained by a constant gas flow of 200–400 ml/min.  
In otherwise healthy patients undergoing laparoscopy, the threshold IAP that leads to hemodynamic changes appears to be 12 mmHg. Those with underlying cardiac disease will decompensate with less than 12 mmHg.     
The lower the Insufflation pressures, the lower the IAP, thus the cardiac effects are less pronounced. 

The raised IAP of the pneumoperitoneum combined with the alteration in the patient's position may have significant physiology effects on the patient.  
See “Laparoscopic Physiology Changes.”

CO2 is the gas of choice because it is noncombustible, highly soluble, and readily eliminated through the lungs. Air is not used because it may be absorbed by the vascular system with catastrophic consequences.

**Bed Positioning**  
You may be asked to position the bed in Trendelenburg or Reverse Trendelenburg. This will anatomically shift the abdominal contents out of the surgeon’s way for a better view. Always make sure your patient has a safety strap on. This is especially important with lateral tilts (as seen with a laparoscopic cholecystectomy).

**Some Indications for Exploratory Laparoscopy:**  
Acute abdominal pain.  
Trauma  
Staging laparoscopy for intra-abdominal cancers.  
Biopsies  
 

**Contraindications for Exploratory Laparoscopy:**  
Patients who are too ill or unstable to tolerate pneumoperitoneum, potential hypercarbia, or general anesthesia.  
Presence of an anterior abdominal wall infection (cellulitis or soft tissue infection).  
Extensive adhesions or scarring, secondary to previous abdominal surgery.  
Aorto-iliac aneurysmal disease which may be associated with increased risk of vascular rupture.  
Pregnancy,  which may be associated with injury to a gravid uterus or fetal distress.  
Cardiopulmonary compromise.  
Morbid obesity.
