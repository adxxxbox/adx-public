### TAVR (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement)

A minimally invasive approach for implanting an artificial heart valve inside a stenotic aortic valve. These are performed under local anesthetic, sedation, or GETA and fluoroscopic rather than echocardiographic guidance.

**Indications:** For patients who are too high risk for traditional aortic valve surgery.

**Vessel Access:**   
A cut-down of the common femoral artery (CFA) performed under direct visualization or a trans-axillary approach using a surgical cut-down technique.

A catheter is usually threaded through the femoral artery to the aortic valve.  A replacement valve (that is actually inside of a stent) collapses to a very small diameter (it is crimped onto the balloon device). After the surgeon does a balloon valvuloplasty to open the patient’s own stenotic valve, the surgeon positions the new replacement valve inside the patient's stenotic aortic valve and inflates the balloon which opens the stent. The balloon is removed, but the stent remains with the new valve working perfectly inside.  

The heart valve team consists of two interventional cardiologists, a cardiac surgeon and a CRNA.

Rapid ventricular pacing at 180bpm while stopping ventilation will temporarily interrupt cardiac ejection and minimizes heart movement during valvuloplasty and prosthesis implantation. This helps the exact placement of the prosthesis within the native annulus. However, it also causes hypotension and arrhythmia, so consider giving a vasopressor prior to pacing and the cardioversion.

For these procedures, a TEE is valuable when the aortic annular or leaflet calcification is minimal, making angiographic positioning difficult. 

In a recent research trial, a group of aortic valve stenosis patients receiving only medical therapy had a one-year survival rate of 50 percent; TAVR was shown to improve one-year survival to 70 percent.

**Multiple Complications:**   
**Vascular trauma** during device tracking, positioning or deployment.

**Intracardiac trauma** from the pacing wire or the stiff catheter wire.  
It often goes unnoticed at the time, but may, ultimately, have catastrophic consequences.

**Dissection or perforation of the iliofemoral axis** can occur following sheath insertion. Perforation might only become apparent after removal of the sheath-- should sudden, unexplained hypotension occurs.

**Acute vessel closure** secondary to dissection, spasm or thrombosis. You will see critical limb ischemia.  

**Subclavian dissections** from the trans-axillary route.

**Acute Coronary Obstruction:** If the coronary ostia are narrowed (<10mm from the base of the aortic leaflet), the sealing cuff of the valve prosthesis might be directly occlusive to one of the ostia. A displaced bulky calcified native leaflet can also occlude a coronary ostium.

**Annular & Aortic Root Rupture is rare**

Rupture of the aortic annulus or root is rare.

**New AV block** - requiring pacemaker implantation in up to 6% of cases.

**Cardiac Perforation & Tamponade-** Intracardiac perforation- can often go unnoticed until the early postoperative period, especially where the perforation is small and contained within the RV region.

**Embolus****\-** An emboli from manipulation of a heavily calcified aortic valve; the procedure can dislodge microdebris from the arch atheroma or from the valve itself, causing a cerebral embolism.

**Epinephrine into the LV cavity**  
Giving Epinephrine using a pigtail catheter can often be an effective and rapid means of counteracting sudden hypotension after valve implantation. Hypotensive difficulties are reported in up to 10% of cases.
