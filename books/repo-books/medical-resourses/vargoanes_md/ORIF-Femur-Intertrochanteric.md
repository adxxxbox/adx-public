ORIF of Femur (Intertrochanteric)     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### ORIF of Femur (Intertrochanteric)

Intertrochanteric breaks are proximal fractures high up near the hip joint.   
These patients will arrive to surgery in traction to minimize the muscle spasms. They won’t remove with the traction until the patient is asleep.  
**Possible methods of repair:**  
External Fixator.

ORIF (plates & screws, fixed angle devices, locking plates).

Flexible nails.  
Locked rigid nails.  
Percutaneous Pinning.

**ORIF Intertrochanteric and Subtrochanteric:**

A compression screw is inserted up the femoral neck and into the femoral head. This is either cross linked through a large nail that extends down the inside of the femur or to a plate that runs down the side of the femur and is attached using screws.  
**Anesthetic: General/ETT:**  
Regional: A Spinal is optional. Consider Propofol or a little Ketamine for positioning of the spinal due to pain.  
**Position:** Supine or lateral, usually on a fracture table. The arm of the unaffected side is extended and padded. The affected side arm is usually taped in a flexed position across their abdomen or chest.  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**Neo Drip:** Yes, especially if a spinal is done.  
**EBL:** 50-150 mLs  
**IV Access:** 18 or 20G  
  
**Possible Complications:**

Fat embolus.  
Vascular or nerve injury: this is rare.  
Malunion  
Nonunion  
Wound infection.  
  
**More Notes**  
All Hip Fracture surgery is highly individualized.

Fractures are commonly treated with multiple surgical screws. A side plate and metal surgical screws are used for Intertrochanteric Fractures and Subtrochanteric Fractures.

Some Subtrochanteric Fractures are secured with a metal rod that inserts into the bone.

Women experience more Hip Fractures than men.  Women may be more susceptible because of differences in their skeletal structure and bone composition. Additionally, women may have higher rates of bone density loss from Osteoporosis, a bone weakening disease.  For both women and men, bone density generally decreases after the age of 50.
