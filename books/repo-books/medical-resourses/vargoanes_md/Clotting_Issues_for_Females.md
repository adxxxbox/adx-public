### Clotting Issues for Females

Females with clotting factor deficiencies tend to have more symptoms because of menstruation and childbirth.  
Menorrhagia is usually the first indication and may lead to anemia.  
  
Women with clotting factor deficiencies should receive genetic counseling about the risks of having an affected child well in advance of any planned pregnancies and should see an obstetrician as soon as they suspect they are pregnant.  
  
The obstetrician should work closely with a hematologist to provide the best care during pregnancy and childbirth and to minimize the potential complications for both the mother and the newborn.  
  
Women with certain factor deficiencies (such as factor XIII deficiency and afibrinogenemia) may be at greater risk of miscarriage and placental abruption (a premature separation of the placenta from the uterus that disrupts the flow of blood and oxygen to the fetus). Therefore, these women require treatment throughout the pregnancy to prevent these complications.  
  
**Postpartum Bleeding**  
The main risk of bleeding disorders with pregnancy is postpartum hemorrhage.  
Postpartum hemorrhage can be reduced with appropriate treatment.  
Mode of delivery plays an important part **–** vaginal birth vs. cesarean section.  
Factor replacement may be necessary in some cases.
