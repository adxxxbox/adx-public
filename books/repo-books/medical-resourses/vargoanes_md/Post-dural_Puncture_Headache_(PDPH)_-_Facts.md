_After an accidental dural puncture (ADP) with a 17g epidural needle, it is associated with a high incident rate (>70-80%) of a PDPH.  
  
PDPH is from the loss of CSF through the dural and arachnoid tear produced by a large spinal/epidural needle.  
  
The CSF loss exceeds the CSF production rate causing intracranial hypotension.  
  
The loss of the cushioning CSF effects can lead to gravitational sagging of the brain and traction of the meninges and other intracranial pain-sensitive structures.  
  
Sitting upright exacerbates the PDPH.  
  
The characteristic sign of PDPH is severe bilateral positional orthostatic headache, worsening within 15 minutes when assuming the upright position and improving dramatically when positioned horizontally.  
  
**Headache sx:** Throbbing, burning, frontal and/or occipital radiating to the neck and shoulders.  
**Other sx:** Neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, audio-vestibular disturbances and paresthesia of the scalp and/or upper extremities.  
  
**Onset of PDPH:** from a few hours or 7-12 days after deliveryMost PDPH occurs with 24-48 hours after delivery.  
  
**Abducens Nerve Palsy -** recognized by an abducted eye, blurred vision and diplopia.  
Diplopia usually occurs 4-10 days after the ADP and is mostly transient.Bed rest and hydration are usually NOT effective with moderate to severe PDPH.  
  
**Differential Diagnosis of PDHD  
**Postpartum headaches (not related to dural puncture) are also referred to as secondary postpartum headache. They occur 40% of the time, so differential diagnosis may be difficult. The majority of these postpartum headaches are from patients with a history of previous headaches. Migraine and tension headaches account for most of these headaches.  
  
**Headaches with Preeclampsia -** often associated with severe, throbbing and holocephalic headache.  
Pneumocephalus should be suspected if the headache appears after the epidural procedure when the epidural space was identified using the loss of resistance technique with air.  
  
**Intracranial venous thrombosis -** can be present with positional headache, mimicking a PDPH.  
  
**Other causes of secondary postpartum headache:  
**Postpartum stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic)  
Rupture of vascular malformations  
Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome  
  
**Treatment for PDHD  
Bed rest and hydration** \- may only have minimal effects  
  
**Analgesics:** Acetaminophen, NSAIDS. Opioids have only a limited and transient effect  
  
**Transnasal sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGB** ): is now being unutilized by some  
anesthesia providers to alleviate the headache.  
  
**Caffeine:** 300-500mg IV Q-day or BID **–** produces vertebral vasoconstriction. Usually only a transient effect on ameliorating the symptoms.  
  
**Sumatriptan:** a serotonin receptor agonist usually used for migraine headaches. Works like caffeine and also has limited effects.  
  
**Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH):** Increases CSF production, retains salt and water and possible increase in endorphins. There is limited data on the efficacy.  
  
**Gabapentin:** GABA agonist has been reported to significantly reduce the headache, nausea and vomiting.  
  
**Epidural Blood Patch (EBP):** Currently still the gold standard. An EBP is indicated in 40% of moderate and severe PDPH.  
  
**What is an Epidural Blood Patch?** Slowly injecting freshly drawn autologous blood into the epidural space. The optimal amount is 20 mLs.More than 20 mLs can increase the risk of serious complications.  
Procedure should be stopped if the patient reports severe pain of a dermatome origin.  
  
**Contraindications of EBP:** same as neuraxial anesthesia, fever, signs of infection such as leukocytosis.  
  
**Effectiveness of EBP:** Immediate relief 90% of the time. A 2 nd EBP may be needed 30% of the time. Permanent relief in 70% of patients.  
  
**Increased risk of failure:** When the EBP is > 4 days after the ADP.  
  
**EBP Mechanisms of action (2):  
1\.** Creates a fibrin clot that patches the leaking dura  
2\. Creates a tamponade effect which normalizes CSF pressure (immediate headache relief)  
  
**Epidural catheters and Accidental Dural Puncture** When an ADP occurs, it is common to repeat the epidural or intracatheter placement.  
  
**Intrathecal Catheters with ADP  
**It is recommended to thread the catheter into the spinal (subarachnoid) space for continuous spinal analgesia offers immediate labor analgesia. This is recommended over repeated epidural attempts risking another puncture.  
Although still controversial, inserting the epidural catheter intrathecally when witnessing an ADP reduces the risk of PDPH. The epidural catheter may mechanically seal the dura hole.  
  
**Epidural Doses with an Intrathecal Catheter  
**Labor Epidural analgesia: 1.75-2.5 mg plain preservative free bupivacaine and 15-25 mcg of fentanyl bolus, followed by continuous infusion of 0.05 – 0.125% bupivacaine and fentanyl (2mcg/mL) titrated to a T10 bilateral sensory level at 0.5-3 mL/hr.Always label the catheter as a spinal catheter.  
  
**Prophylactic EBP  
**Can easily be performed by injecting 20 mLs freshly drawn, non-coagulated autologous blood into the epidural space after the ADP. It should not be injected until complete resolution of sensory and motor block so the patient could detect pain with injection avoiding a subarachnoid injection through a misplace epidural catheter. Also, residual local anesthetic may actually prevent clot formation.Despite the fact that the prophylactic EBP does not significantly reduce the incidence of PDHD after an ADP, it still reduces the severity and duration of symptoms.  
  
**Intrathecal Saline  
**After the ADP, injecting 10-20 mLs of normal saline into the intrathecal space (via epidural needle or catheter) that is intrathecally placed, can increase CSF pressure and seal the meningeal puncture and minimize CSF outflow.  
  
**Epidural Morphine  
**Epidural injection of 3mg of Astramorph in a 10 mL saline administered once after the anesthetic and another dose 24 hours later. This significantly reduces the incidence of PDPH after ADP. The side effect to this is nausea/vomiting and pruritus.
