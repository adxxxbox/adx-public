### AICD (ICD)

**There are three types of ICDs**  
Single chamber  
Dual chamber  
Bi-ventricular

An ICD is a small, lightweight device that keeps track of the heart’s rhythm. When the heart has a dangerous arrhythmia, the ICD returns to its normal rhythm. Which ICD is placed in the patient depends on which heart chambers require pacing support.

**An ICD can do one or more of the following:**

**Anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP)**: The ICD can send out a series of pulses to override a fast rhythm. 

**Cardioversion**: If the ATP doesn't slow down the fast rhythm, the ICD can give the heart one or more weak shocks.

**Defibrillation**: If the ICD senses a very fast, irregular rhythm, it quickly sends a strong shock to the heart to override the fast rhythm. 

**Bradycardia Pacing**: All ICDs can function as a pacemaker and send out pulses to increase the HR during bradycardia.

All ICDs have 2 parts: **electrodes** (thin flexible wires) and a **generator**.

**The electrodes (leads):** Sense or watch the heart's electrical activity. They are generally made of platinum with an insulated coating of either silicone or polyurethane. The leads carry the electric shock from the generator. At the tip of each lead is a tiny device called an electrode that delivers the necessary electrical shock to the heart.

**The Generator** is the battery power source and the "brains" of the AICD. It stores information about all arrhythmias a patient has and keeps track of how often it needs to give their heart a shock.  
  
The electric shock is created by the generator, carried by the leads and delivered by the electrodes to the heart. The decision of where to put the leads depends on the needs of the patient.
