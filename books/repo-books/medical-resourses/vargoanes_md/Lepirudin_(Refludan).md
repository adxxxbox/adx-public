Lepirudin (Refludan)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; padding-left: 10px;}

### Lepirudin (Refludan)

Direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI) - bivalent  
**Thrombin also known as factor II.  
  
**_**Hirudin:**_ A naturally occurring peptide in the salivary glands of medicinal leeches.  
  
Bivalent  
Bivalent DTIs (such as desirudin, lepirudin, and bivalirudin) block thrombin at 2 sites—the active (catalytic) site and exosite 1 (fibrinogen-binding site).

**Lepirudin and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)**  
Approved in the US for the treatment of HIT.  
  
**Indications:**  
For anticoagulation in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and associated thromboembolic disease to prevent further thromboembolic complications.  
  
**Mechanism of Action  
**One molecule of lepirudin binds to one molecule of thrombin (Factor II) thus blocking the thrombogenic activity of thrombin.  
**Note:** Thrombin is the principal enzyme of hemostasis. It catalyzes the conversion of  
fibrinogen to fibrin and activates procoagulant factors V, VIII, XI, and XIII, activation  
of protein C; and platelet aggregation. Heparin is an indirect thrombin inhibitor. Its mode of action is independent of antithrombin III.  
Platelet factor 4 does not inhibit lepirudin.  
  
**How administered:** IV infusion - continuously for 2 to 10 days, or longer if needed.  
  
**Lab Monitoring**  
There is no therapeutic drug monitoring widely available for DTIs, in contrast with warfarin (INR) and heparin (APTT). The ecarin clotting time, although not in general clinical use, would be the most appropriate monitoring test.  
  
**Optional Monitoring:  
aPTT** is the main test that can be monitored when needed.  
**PT/INR:** Also may increase in a dose dependent fashion.  
  
**Antidote: None, consider** FFP & cryoprecipitate  
Literature states that either hemofiltration or hemodialysis (using high-flux dialysis membranes with a cutoff point of 50,000 daltons, eg, AN/69) may be useful.  
  
**Hirudin -** Lepirudin is a recombinant hirudin derived from yeast cells.  
**How administered:** IV infusion - continuously for 2 to 10 days, or longer if needed.**T1/2:** 1.3 hours**Half-life with CrCl** **< 15mL/min:** up to 2 days  
**Elimination**  
About 48% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine which consists of unchanged drug (35%) and other fragments of the parent drug.  
  
**Lepirudin and Renal**  
There should be a lepirudin dose reduction of 85% with severe renal impairment, and treatment should be monitored using aPTT or ecarin clotting time (ECT; more specific).  
There is still a prolonged aPTT 8 hours after SQ administration of low-dose hirudins.**  
  
Antibody Formation**  
Lepirudin has been associated with antibody formation (incidence 40%), delayed elimination, unpredictable and prolonged activity, as well as association with bleeding and anaphylaxis.  
  
**Systemic Clearance  
**Systemic clearance in women is about 25% lower than in men.  
In elderly patients, clearance is about 20% lower than in younger patients.  
This may be explained by the lower creatinine clearance in elderly patients compared to younger patients.  
  
**Renal Dosing**  
**Dosing adjustment in renal impairment:** All patients with a creatinine clearance of < 60 ml/min or a serum creatinine of >1.5 mg/dl should receive a reduction in lepirudin dosage.  
  
**Lepirudin and Antibody formation**  
Lepirudin has been associated with antibody formation (incidence 40%), delayed elimination, unpredictable and prolonged activity, as well as association with bleeding and anaphylaxis.
