### FEMTO (Femtosecond Laser)

This quick procedure is usually in a different room and does not need anesthesia. The FEMTO Laser is considered the next great leap forward in cataract surgery. The laser is used to assist or replace certain portions of traditional cataract surgery. The laser can create the incisions and perform the lens fragmentation far more precisely than current manual techniques. It precisely and painlessly crushes the cloudy lens. The patient is then transported to the operating room for the rest of the procedure. It is used to replace a manual part of our existing PHACOs, or phacoemulsification and cataract extraction.
