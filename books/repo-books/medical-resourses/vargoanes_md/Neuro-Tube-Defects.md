Neural Tube Defects (NTDs)   

### Neural Tube Defects (NTDs)

Neural tube defects are abnormalities that can occur in the brain, spine, or spinal column of a developing embryo and are present at birth.

**There are several types of NTDs**  
**Open:** Frequently involve the entire central nervous system  
Neural tissue (brain and/or cord) is exposed with leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)

Most common type of NTD

Defects include anencephaly, hydranencephaly, iniencephaly, schizenchephaly, and open spina bifida

**Closed:** Localized and confined to the spine  
Brain rarely affected  
Neural tissue is not exposed although the skin covering the defect may be dysplastic  
Diverse group of defects in which the spinal cord is marked by malformations of fat, bone, or meninges.  
Usually asymptomatic, but can cause incomplete paralysis with urinary and bowel dysfunction.  
In some cases the only outward sign is a dimple or tuft or hair on the spine  
Defects include lipomyelomeningocele, lipomeningocele, closed spina bifida, and tethered cord

Example  
**Cranial**AnencephalyEncephaloceleCongenital dermal sinus

**Spinal:**  
Spina bifida  
Spina bifida occulta  
Myelomeningocele  
Meningocele  
Congenital dermal sinus  
Caudal agenesia
