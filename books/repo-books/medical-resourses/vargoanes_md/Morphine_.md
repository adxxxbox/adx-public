### Morphine Adjuvant to Neuraxial Anesthesia

_Morphine (like other neuraxial drugs) must be preservative free (PF)__Names of PF Morphine: Astromorph, Duramorph , and Infumorph_

Morphine is a hydrophilic phenanthrene derivative. It is approximately 100 times less potent and 800 times less soluble than Fentanyl.  
Morphine interacts predominantly with the opioid mu-receptors.  
Neuraxial morphine has been shown to be more effective than fentanyl for post op labor pain due to its longer duration.  
  
**Duration of Post-Op Analgesia for C-sections:** 12-24 hours  
  
**Neuraxial Morphine** : Slow onset, long duration, and late onset of respiratory depression (very rare at recommended doses).Morphine for Post C-section analgesia has been shown to have a ceiling analgesic effect. After the ceiling effect, there is minimal benefit with increased side effects.  
**Intrathecal** : there is minimal analgesic effect after 0.1mg**Epidural:** there is minimal analgesic effect after 3.75 mg  
  
**Doses Neuraxial Morphine  
Intrathecal Doses:** 0.1-0.5mg  
**Popular dose:** 0.1mg  
**Limited Side Effects:** 0.1-0.25mg  
  
**Epidural Doses of Morphine  
**The only time we usually administer epidural morphine is for post-op pain following a C-section, before we pull the catheter.  
**Limit:** No more than 10 mg in a 24-hour period should be administered.  
**Post C-section Doses** : 1-5 mg  
**Popular Dose:** 3 mg**Adjuvant to local Anesthetic with loading dose:** 2-4 mg (rarely used)  
  
**Common mixture in Local Anesthetic Bag (continuous infusion)  
**Rarely added. Fentanyl or Sufenta are the two most common opioids.  
  
**Method of Action  
Intrathecal (Spinal) Opioids  
Can bind to opioid receptors in three different areas to produce analgesia  
**1) Substantia Gelatinosa (Rexed’s lamina II) in the Dorsal Horn- have direct access and it is the  
main of action. The release of substance P is reduced and the transmission of impulses through the Substantia Gelatinosa is inhibited.  
2) They are also transported supra-spinally by CSF flow where they modulate descending  
inhibitory pain pathways.  
3) A small amount of drug penetrates the dura mater into the epidural cavity. This allows the drug to reach the venous plexus of Baston, enter the systemic circulation, and results in  
centrally-mediated analgesia (minor effect).  
  
**Time of Possible Respiratory Depression:** 6-18 hours (literature varies)  
Morphine has a low lipid solubility and hangs out in the CSF longer, allowing it to move cephalad and possibly enter the brainstem causing a delayed respiratory depression.  
Morphine may outlast the antagonism of Narcan- 90 minutes.  
Respiratory depression is more likely in elderly patients, or if there has been concomitant use of opioids by a different route.  
Morphine appears in the CSF within 15 minutes and reaches peak concentration at 90-120 minutes.  
  
**Pharmacokinetics of Morphine  
pKa:** 8.0  
**Unionized at 7.4 (%):** 23  
**Plasma Protein bound (%):** 30  
**Terminal Half Life:** 3 hours  
**Clearance (mL/min/kg):** 15-30  
**Vol of Distribution (L/kg):** 3-5  
**Relative Lipid Solubility:** 1 (very low)  
(Fentanyl =580) and (Alfenta= 90)  
  
**Metabolism  
**The metabolism of morphine: mostly in liver, some metabolism occurs in the brain and the kidneys.  
**  
Morphine is glucuronidated to the following Metabolites:**  
**Morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G):** (about 60%) – no analgesic activity  
M3G - exhibits no analgesic effects  
**Morphine-6-glucuronide M6G** :(about 5 to 15%) Active metabolite with analgesic properties  
  
**Other Metabolites  
**Sulfation in the liver to produces **morphine-3-etheral sulfate** .  
Normorphine  
  
A small fraction (less than 5%) of morphine is demethylated.  
  
**Elimination:**  
Primarily renal excretion of M3G, and its effective half-life after intravenous administration is normally 2 to 4 hours.  
10% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine.  
A small amount of the glucuronide conjugate is excreted in the bile.  
  
**Side Effects  
**_Both intrathecal and epidural morphine are associated with a higher incidence of nausea, vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention, sedation, and delayed respiratory depression when compared to fentanyl.  
_  
**Urinary Retention (opioids)  
**Most of the urinary retention is caused by local anesthetics.  
Spinal opioids still influence bladder functions and cause urinary retention.  
This is why the patient’s foley remains.  
  
**Pruritus and Morphine  
**Pregnant women are more susceptible to pruritus after neuraxial opioid administration than other populations with incidence of 60-100%Pruritus is the most common side effect. Nausea and vomiting are rare.  
Opioids can also induce itching at the spinal level by “itch-selective” secondary neurons in the lamina I spino-thalamic tract of the dorsal horn.  
The mu receptor is also responsible for some side effects, especially pruritus and nausea or vomiting.  
  
**PONV  
**The less narcotics given, usually the less PONV.
