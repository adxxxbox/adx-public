### Radial Artery Used as a Graft

Radial artery graft patency is best when it is used to graft a left-sided coronary artery with >70% stenosis and worst when it is used to bypass the right coronary artery with a stenosis of only moderate severity.  
  
Formerly, when the radial artery was ori for used as a graft for CABG , it was soon abandoned due to spasm and graft failure. Later investigations revealed that some of these patients who remained on calcium channel blockers still had a patent radial artery graft after 15 years. Thus the radial artery as a graft was re-introduced in 1989.  
  
The radial artery is a muscular artery with a prominent adventitia. The very muscular media of the radial artery explains the increased vulnerability to spasm. The proximal radial artery spasms most often. This is now controlled by calcium channel blockers. Because the vasa vasorum of the radial artery does not penetrate into the media, oxygen and nutrients are provided by luminal diffusion, which suggests that transposition of the radial artery as a free graft should not have adverse ischemic implications for the vessel wall over the long term.  
  
**Incision**  
A “lazy S” incision in the forearm provides better wound healing than a linear incision, which results in scar contracture. The incision should stop 2 cm above the wrist, where the artery narrows, to reduce the risk of sensory disturbance and to permit comfortable wearing of a watch.  
  
Up to 10% of patients may experience forearm paresthesia resulting from injury to the terminal branches of the radial nerve (if the incision is carried too distally) but this is usually temporary. Often, a cacium channel blocker infusion is begun to reduce the chance of radial artery vasospasm. Sometimes a nitroglycerine drip may be preferable to a calcium channel blocker to avoid increased incidences of bradycardia and hypotension during surgery.  
  
There is no definite evidence regarding the efficacy of perioperative calcium channel blockers to reduce or abolish postoperative radial artery spasm. Often a nitroglycerine infusion is used.  
  
In any case, it is common practice continue a calcium channel blocker for one year following surgery.  
  
Sometimes, intraluminal dilatation of the radial artery is maintained not by the use of antispasmodic agents but by placing the harvested artery in a papaverine and blood solution.  
  
The radial artery graft works best when anastomosed to the coronary arteries that are very stenotic. The radial artery should not be connected to coronary arteries with <70% stenosis as this may reduce patency rates.  
  
The radial artery should not be harvested in patients who are potential future candidates for hemodialysis.
