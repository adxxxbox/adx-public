### Corneal Transplant or Keratoplasty

Keratoplasty is another way of saying a corneal transplant. This can be related to damage to the cornea from injury. There is a congenital problem called keritoconus in which the lens is cone-shaped instead of flat, and this is the largest reason for doing transplants.  
Never take the patient into the operating room (or induction) until you know the eye team has the donor Cornea available. It is usually a donor cornea from a cadaver.  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT or LMA. A rare Eye Doc who is very skilled and has a cooperative patient can do these with a good RBB and alert attentive CRNA care.  
A Retrobulbar block can be done intraoperatively for post op pain.  
It’s OK to use Anectine for a GETA.  
**Position:** Supine with arms tucked and the patient remains on the same stretcher. The stretcher is parked 90-180 degrees away from you (unless you are starting out as a general).  
**IV Access**: 22G is acceptable. A 500mL NS bag with micro drip tubing is popular.  
**EBL**: Minimal  
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes. Depends on the surgeon.  
**Diagnosis:** Usually a detached retina. Consider an antiemetic towards the end of a case, especially if the patient has a history of motion sickness. Retching increases IOP.
