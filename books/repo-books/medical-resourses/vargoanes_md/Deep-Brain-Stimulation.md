### Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's Disease

Deep brain stimulation is a newer method of treatment to block abnormal nerve signals in the brain, thereby reducing or eliminating neurological movement disorders.  

**Indications:**  
Parkinson disease  
Dystonia and other tremors  
Obsessive-compulsive disorder  
Epilepsy  
Chronic pain  
Alzheimer disease  
Multiple sclerosis

Deep brain stimulation may differ depending on the site of stimulation. The primary target sites vary with the patient’s symptoms:  
Subthalamic nuclei (STN)  
Globus pallidus pars internal (GPi)  
Ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus.

In addition, SubThalmic Nucleus (STN) inhibition decreases after insertion of a Deep Brain Stimulator (DBS). DBS lowers the production of glutamate, and this has been suggested as a mechanism of neuroprotection in patients with Parkinson disease.

**Surgical Technique**  
**This surgical procedure involves 2 stages:**  
1\. Insertion of the electrode(s) into the target area of the brain.  
2\. The implantation of the programmable pulse generator under the skin on the chest (like a pacer). The wires are tunneled under the skin and subcutaneous tissue from the top of the head, down behind the ear and the side of the neck to the generator.

To increase the pinpoint accuracy, the surgeon utilizes frame-based imaging, electrophysiologic guidance with MicroElectrode Recording (MER), and macrostimulation testing while the patient is awake.

The procedure really begins in the MRI with the placement of a rigid head frame to the patient’s skull to visualize brain structures and to establish references to external coordinates for accurate insertion of the electrode into the target areas for stimulation. Both of these frames may restrict access to the patient’s airway in varying degrees.  
After imaging, the patient is transferred to the OR where he or she is positioned in a supine or low Fowler’s position on the operating room table with the stereotactic frame fixed to the bed.  
  
A burr hole is made in the cranium for electrode insertion to the targeted area and spontaneous neuronal discharges are recorded.

There will be communication back and forth between the surgeon and patient during stimulation. The wound is then closed. If bilateral DBS insertions are planned, a second incision will be made on the other side and the procedure is repeated.  

The second stage is the tunneling the wires under the skin and SubQ tissue from the top of the head, down behind the ear and the side of the neck to the generator. This is very stimulating and we usually start a Propofol infusion, so make sure you have some ready.

**Anesthetic:  
Pre-op:** Try to get the patient to void. These can be long procedures and many surgeons do not want a Foley catheter.  
**For Electrode Placement/Testing:** A light MAC; NC with ETCO2.  
**Precedex (Dexmedetomidine):** low dose (0.3–0.6 mcg/kg/h) is probably your best choice because of its non–GABA-mediated mechanism of action allowing for MER, hemodynamic stability, and analgesic properties. Titrate Precedex to the state of arousal during DBS insertion.   
**Versed:** should be avoided unless the surgeon wants it. Versed abolishes MER, alters the threshold for stimulation and induces dyskinesia.  
**Propofol:** 50mcg/kg along with a low dose Remifentanil drip can also be used instead of Precedex. However, Propofol can abolish tremors and induces dyskinesia.  
**General anesthesia** interferes with the evaluation of the clinical benefits of DBS by the suppression of clinical symptoms such as tremors and rigidity.  

**For the Insertion of Pulse Generator**: General-Propofol infusion or LMA.  
At this point, there are no concerns with specific anesthetic drugs because no testing is performed. The tunneling is very stimulating.

**A-line:** Yes, these can be long procedures.  
**IV Access:** 20g is acceptable.  
**Fluids:** Don’t give a lot: the patient is awake and these cases can be long.  
**Neosynephrine Drip:** Yes  
**Duration:** 3-5 hours  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**Foley:** Usually not, because it can be too irritating for the awake patient.  
**Possible Complications:**  
Hemorrhage  
Infection  
Hardware Failure  
Migration of electrodes

**More Notes**  
Some patients may require sedation for frame placement while in the MRI. If conscious sedation is required, the Precedex drip with monitoring may be started there. It is rare, but sometimes general anesthesia is required from the start.
