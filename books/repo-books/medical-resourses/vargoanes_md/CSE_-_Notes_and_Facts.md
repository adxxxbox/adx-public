### CSE Notes and Facts

  
CSE:(Combined Spinal Epidural)  

**Subarachnoid pressure is normally greater than epidural pressure by 5–15 cmH20.  
After an epidural injection, epidural pressure may exceed subarachnoid pressure contributing to a higher spinal block due to:  
  
1)** Some of the local anesthetic will flux from the epidural space into the subarachnoid space via  
small dural puncture (hole) left by the spinal needle. It is temporary.  
  
**2)** The volume expansion in the epidural space compresses in the narrow neighboring  
subarachnoid space and forces cephalad movement of CSF and previously injected local  
anesthetic.  
  
Resistance with injection is not good. It confirms the catheter placement is in the ligaments.  
  
The risk of subarachnoid placement or migration of epidural catheters through the dural hole made by the spinal needle is virtually eliminated if needles smaller than 24 G are used.  
  
**Epidural catheter migration through the dura**This is rare and probably no more common that after routine epidural placement. It is important to realize that any epidural catheter may migrate into the subarachnoid space, whether placed as part of a CSE or not. This is why every epidural dose should be treated as a test dose.  
  
It is NOT safe to test the epidural catheter until the subarachnoid block is regressing.
