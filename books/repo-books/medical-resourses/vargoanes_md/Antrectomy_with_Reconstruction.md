### Antrectomy with Reconstruction

Also called distal gastrectomy

Removal of the distal third of the stomach (antrum)

Refer to “Billroth I and II Procedures” for images and details.

**Indication:** Usually, Cancer

Since the inception of proton pump inhibitors, indications for gastrectomy are almost always for carcinoma.

Quite often, antrectomy is used alongside vagotomy to maximize its safety and effectiveness.

**Vagotomy:** Removal of part of the vagus nerve

**Anesthesia:** Usually RSI with NGT

After the antrectomy, a reconstruction procedure is needed.

The surgeon will anastomose the remaining portion of the stomach to the digestion system, which is either the duodenum or jejunum.

Reconstruction aims to restore digestive tract continuity and improve the nutritional status and quality of life of patients after gastrectomy.

Most of these procedures use the small intestines.

**Possible reconstructions include:**

**Billroth I or Péan procedure:**

The distal stomach is removed, and the remaining stomach is anastomosed to the duodenum.

This procedure is also known as a gastroduodenostomy.

**Billroth II:** Gastrojejunostomy

**It involves two anastomoses:**

**A:** The stomach is anastomosed to the jejunum (gastrojejunostomy)

First, the proximal end of the duodenum is closed off.

The distal stomach is then anastomosed to the proximal jejunum.

**B:** A side-to-side anastomosis is made between the jejunum and distal duodenum to facilitate the flow of bile and pancreatic juice.

The procedure can also involve removing the greater omentum and lymph nodes.

**Note:** The gastric remnant is anastomosed to the jejunum, just past the ligament of Treitz.

**A Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy:**

A Billroth II may be converted into a Roux-en-Y, if necessary.

**The Roux-en-Y** has a different configuration than a Billroth II gastrojejunostomy.

It is another reconstruction technique that can be used after a gastrectomy.

**Gastrojejunostomy with a Roux-en-Y reconstruction**

The Roux-en-Y reconstruction seems superior to Billroth I and Billroth II

**Anesthesia:** Usually RSI/ETT

Refer to “Gastrectomy” for details.

**Possible complications:** Roux syndrome or the Roux stasis syndrome From Roux-en-Y reconstruction
