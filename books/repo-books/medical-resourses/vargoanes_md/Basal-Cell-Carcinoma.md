### Basal Cell Carcinoma (BBC)

BCC is a very slow growing skin CA and rarely spreads.

Cases are usually simple excisions and sometimes a skin graft is performed. The surgeon will usually localize the area, take a slice and send the margins off to pathology. Most of the time the surgeon will just go ahead and suture the excision closed before pathology calls back. Don’t wake the patient up until pathology has called back the results. The surgeon will inform you when you could wake the patient up.  
I’ve seen some surgeons verify the margins themselves in the room with a microscope.

**Anesthetic:** Usually a MAC. Sometimes an LMA if the BCC is really involved.

**Duration:** 15-45 minutes  
**IV Access:** 22G is acceptable.  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**Complications:** Minimal
