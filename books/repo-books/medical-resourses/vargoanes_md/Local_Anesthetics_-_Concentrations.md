### Local Anesthetic and Concentrations

The onset of action of local anesthetic action depends on the route of administration and the dose or concentration of drug.  
Increasing the concentration of a local anesthetic can accelerate onset.  
Example: 3% Chloroprocaine has a faster onset than 2% Chloroprocaine.  
3% clearly has more molecules to diffuse which quickens the onset.  
  
3% Chloroprocaine has a higher pKa (8.9) vs 0.2% Ropivacaine which has a lower pKa (8.2)  
Remember: The closer the pH to the blood pH, the faster the onset. Well not in this case.  
3% = 30mg/mL and 0.2% =only 2mg/mL. 3% clearly has many more molecules to diffuse the nerve decreasing the onset.  
  
**Local Anesthetics and Concentrations  
**When the injected volume is constant, an increase in the concentration of local anesthetic increases the degree of sensory anesthesia and the amount of motor block also increases.  
  
**Ex** . 0.75% Bupivacaine will initiate a dense analgesic and motor block.  
0.0625% or 0.125% will provide analgesia but spare a motor block. This is why we use low concentrations of local anesthetics in epidural infusions. We want to preserve the motors so the mother can push for her vaginal delivery.
