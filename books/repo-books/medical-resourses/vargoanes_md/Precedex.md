### Dexmedetomidine (Precedex)

**Generic Name:** Dexmedetomidine hydrochloride**Brand Name:** PrecedexDexmedetomidine = DEX for simplification**Class:** A highly selective alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist.\- Clonidine is also a selective alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist.  
\- Compared to clonidine, DEX is 7 to 10 times more selective for alpha 2 adrenoceptors and has a shorter duration of action than clonidine.  
**  
It produces the following effects with minimal respiratory depression:**  
\- Dose-dependent sedation, anxiolysis and analgesia  
\- Antisialagogue  
\- Volatile agent–sparing properties  
\- Sympatholytic  
  
Commonly used in anesthesia and intensive care units because it can provide short-term sedation  
while decreasing the use of narcotics.  
  
**Antidote:** Atipamezole (Not currently in use for humans)  
**Amnestic properties:** None  
  
**Mechanism of action:  
**\- It is a centrally acting agonist to the pre-and post-synaptic-2 receptors.  
\- These receptors are found ubiquitously in the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems, vital organs, and blood vessels.  
\- Sedative actions are believed to be mediated primarily by post-synaptic alpha 2 adrenoceptors, resulting in decreased norepinephrine (catecholamine) levels, producing sedative and analgesic effects.  
\- Plasma norepinephrine concentrations decreased by 72% (range 40% to 97%).  
Note: A decrease in catecholamines results in sympatholytic effects.  
  
**DEX indications:**  
\- Short-term analgesia for surgical procedures to decrease narcotic requirements.\- Decrease inhalation MAC requirements  
\- Smooth emergence for peds and adults (awake extubations with less bucking)  
\- To prevent emergence delirium.  
\- Sedation for intubated ICU patients.  
\- Fiberoptic intubations  
\- Adjunct for neuraxial anesthesia  
\- Post-op sedation with continuous infusion may be continued.  
\- Ortho: Intraarticular during arthroscopic knee surgery (rare)  
\- Cardiac surgery (more notes at the bottom of page)  
\- Neurosurgery (more notes at the bottom of page)  
\- MRI and CT scans (more notes at the bottom of page)  
**\- Adjuvant in local & regional anesthesia** (more notes at the bottom of page)  
  
**Effects:** Produces centrally mediated sympatholytic, sedative, analgesic effects with minimal respiratory depression.  
  
**Side effects:  
**\- Bradycardia - common  
\- Hypotension - common  
\- Dry mouth**  
DEX may cause dose-dependent bradycardia, especially following a bolus.**  
\- The bradycardia induced by DEX is induced by vagal stimuli.  
\- Clinicians should have access to anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine, glycopyrrolate, or ephedrine) to resolve it.  
  
**When to use DEX with caution:  
\-** 2 nd or 3 rd \-degree heart block  
\- Severe ventricular dysfunction  
\- Hypovolemia  
\- Hypotension  
\- Pregnant or breastfeeding  
\- History of renal or liver disease  
  
The elderly and diabetics are more prone to hypotension as it decreases sympathetic nervous activity.  
  
**Total body weight TBW) vs Ideal body weight (IBW) is controversial.  
**\- An article posted in 2015 stated that DEX dosing regimens should be based on IBW rather than - TBW because obese patients have a larger volume of distribution of the drug than normal-weight patients.  
\- It was found that plasma concentrations of DEX were higher, and elimination half-time was longer in morbidly obese patients than nonobese patients. However, other literature often refutes this.  
  
**Preparation:** Mix to achieve 4mcg/mL  
**Common vials:** 200 mcg/2 mL via (100 mcg/mL)  
  
**The common mixture to get 4 mcg/mL:**  
\- Aspirate 2 mLs from a 50 mL NS bag, inject one vial (200 mcg) = 4 mcg/mL  
\- Aspirate 4 mLs from a 100 mL NS bag, inject two vials (400mcg) = 4 mcg/mL  
  
**DEX dosing:  
**Refer to _“Precedex Dosing Cheat Sheet”_ for more details.**  
  
Infusions and sedation dose range:**  
\- Initial bolus before a maintenance infusion is optional.  
**\- Initial bolus:** 0.5 mcg/kg x 10 to 30 minutes followed by continuous infusion.  
\- Initial boluses were once more popular with open-chest cardiac procedures.  
**Note:** Most anesthesia providers now avoid the initial bolus due to bradycardia and hypotension.  
  
**Continuous Infusion range:** 0.2-0.8 mcg/kg/hour  
**0.4 mcg/kg/hr drip:**  
If a patient weighs 70 kg, drip rate of 7mL/hr will = 0.4mcg/kg/hr  
For an 85 kg patient, drip rate of 8.5 mL/hr gives you 0.4 mcg/kg/hr  
**  
Small intraoperative doses instead of continuous infusion:**  
Doses of 2-4 mcg are common with adults as needed without a continuous infusion.  
Do not exceed a total of 0.5 mcg/kg.

| Route | Dose |
| --- | --- |
| Oral  
**Pre-op peds dental** | 1 mcg/kg |
| **Intramuscular  
premedication** | 2.5 mcg/kg |
| **Spinal Prolongs sensory  
and motor blockade** | 0.1-0.3 mcg intrathecal  
3 mcg is equipotent to 30 mcg of clonidine.  
5 mcg and 25 mcg of fentanyl have been compared  
to vaginal surgeries with bupivacaine anesthesia. |
| **Epidural** | 2mcg/kg in addition to local anesthetic prolongs  
the duration of analgesia and decreases the  
requirement of rescue analgesics |
| **Caudal** | 2mcg/kg with bupivacaine in peds cause more  
sedation, prolongs analgesia, less anesthetic  
consumption and less irritability |
| **Peripheral nerve block** | 1mcg/kg |
| **Buccal Peds  
1 hour before surgery** | 1 mcg/kg |
| **Intranasal  
Peds pre-op** | 1-2 mcg/kg:  
For reducing emergence delirium  
Median onset of sedation of 25 minutes  
Median duration of 85 minutes in healthy children  
undergoing elective surgery  
2 mcg/kg: Faster onset |
| **Intravenous  
Post-op sedation (ICU)** | 0.2 -0.7 mcg/kg/hour |

**Duration of continuous infusion:** Not to exceed 24 hours.  
It is FDA approved in the ICU for not more than 24 hours, though many studies have reported its safe use for a longer duration.  
  
**\- Metabolism:** Almost complete biotransformation with very little unchanged in urine and feces.  
**\- Onset:** < 5 minutes for many patients  
\- DEX literature states that the onset of sedation with an initial loading infusion of 1.0 mcg/kg/hr over 10 minutes provides sedation generally within 10 to 15 minutes after the start of the infusion.  
  
**\- Plasma levels:** Between 0.2 ng/mg and 0.3 ng/ml result in rousable sedation  
**\- Peak:** 20-30 minutes  
**\- Rapid distribution half-life:** About 6 minutes  
**\- Vd:** 2-3L/kg  
**\- Elimination half-time:** Around 2-3 hours  
**\- Protein Binding:** 94%  
**\- Site of clearance:** Hepatic**\- Clearance:** 10-30mL/kg/hr  
\- Has almost a complete biotransformation with very little unchanged dexmedetomidine excreted in urine (95%) and feces (4%).  
  
**\- Hepatic and renal patients:** Clearance is lower than normal subjects and may need dose reduction.  
  
**\- DEX and pregnancy:  
**\- There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on pregnant women.  
\- DEX should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the fetus.  
\- DEX has high lipophilicity, and so it passes through the placenta, but it disappears very fast.  
  
**Nursing mothers:**  
\- It is not known whether DEX is excreted in human milk. Radio-labeled Precedex administered subcutaneously to lactating female rats was excreted in milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Precedex is administered to a nursing woman.  
  
**DEX and geriatrics:  
**\- Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection in elderly patients, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.  
  
**Incompatible with:** Amphotericin B and diazepam  
**Side Effects:** Bradycardia, hypotension, nausea (rare) and dry mouth.  
  
**Other reported adverse effects include (rare):**  
Fever  
Rigors  
Cyanosis  
Muscle weakness  
Arrhythmias: AV Block, cardiac arrest, T-wave inversion, tachycardia  
Angina pectoris  
Pulmonary edema  
Bronchospasm  
Respiratory depression  
Syncope  
Neuropathy  
Paresthesia  
Paresis  
Hyperkalemia  
Lactic acidosis  
Hyperglycemia  
**  
Drug interactions:**  
\- Co-administration of anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics or opioids with dexmedetomidine is likely to enhance their effects.  
\- Hence, a reduction in dosage with these agents is required.  
  
**For cardiac surgery:**  
\- Reduces the extent of myocardial ischemia  
\- MVR with pulmonary hypertension: It can reduce PVR, PAP and PCWP  
\- Controlled hypotension: Maintaining adequate perfusion of the vital organs while making a near-ideal hypotensive agent  
  
**For neurosurgery:**  
\- Providing cerebral hemodynamic stability  
\- It can prevent a sudden increase in ICP during intubation, extubation, and headpin insertion.  
\- It attenuates neurocognitive impairment (delirium and agitation), allowing immediate postoperative neurological evaluation.  
\- It exerts its neuroprotective effects through several mechanisms.  
\- It does not interfere with neurological monitors  
\- Used in awake craniotomy  
\- Useful in children with chronic neurologic impairments.  
  
**MRI and CT scan:**  
\- High doses of DEX (1-3 mcg/kg IV load over 10 minutes with an infusion of 1 mcg/kg/hour) has been used successfully for children undergoing MRI.  
  
**As an adjuvant in local & regional techniques:  
\- Refer to** **_“Precedex (Dexmedetomidine) as a Neuraxial Adjuvant”_ .**  
\- Its highly lipophilic nature allows rapid absorption into the cerebrospinal fluid and binding to alpha 2 adrenoceptors of the spinal cord for its analgesic action.  
\- It prolongs the duration of both sensory and motor blockade induced by local anesthetics irrespective of the route of administration (e.g., epidural, caudal, or spinal.  
\- It enhances both central and peripheral neural blockade.  
  
**More notes:**  
\- DEX is NOT a controlled substance.  
\- It is superior to midazolam and lorazepam for weaning because it shortens the time to extubate and stay in ICU.\- It is mainly used as a continuous infusion.  
\- This is an excellent analgesic that is not a respiratory depressant.  
\- It does not have amnestic properties  
\- It does not need to be turned off prior to extubation.  
\- There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of DEX use in pregnant women.  
\- When DEX is infused for more than 6 hours, patients should be informed to report nervousness, agitation and headaches that may occur for up to 48 hours.
