# Na Pentathol

**Na Pentothal (Thiopental)**  
**Class:** Barbiturate  
Today, it's mostly only used her for cerebral protection.  
**Barbiturates:** derived from barbituric acid.  
Rarely used anymore.  
Has been replaced by Benzos for a pre-anesthetic medication.  
Replaced by Propofol as induction agent of choice.  
**Doses**  
**Induction:** 3-5 mg/kg  
**Patients with increased ICP:** 1.5-3.5 mg/kg  
**Convulsive States:** 75-125 mg  
**Geriatrics:** Reduce dose by 50-67%  
**Maximal Brain Uptake:** 30 seconds  
**Onset:** 30-120 seconds  
**Duration:** 4 minutes  
**pH:** very basic-7.6  
**For grand mal seizures:** effective treatment  
**Metabolism:** Liver, slow, 10-24% each hour  
**Myocardia Depression:** Yes  
**Decreases SVR:** Yes  
**Histamine Release:** Yes  
**Precipitates porphyria:** Yes, in susceptible patients.  
**Receptors Activated:** GABA  
**More Notes**  
The rapid infusion of barbiturates is useful for the treatment of grand mal seizures, but benzodiazepines are still better.  
**Metabolism:**  
Patients with cirrhosis of the liver have the same clearance time of Thiopental with that of a normal person.  
**ICP and CRMO2:**  
The administration of Thiopental at 3mg/kg is as effective as 1.5mg/kg lidocaine in decreasing ICP after surgical stimulation in patients with brain tumors.  
Excellent brain protection, it stops seizures, and very cheap.  
High alkaline properties make them bacteriostatic.  
Incompatible for mixture with opioids, catecholamines, and neuromuscular blocking drugs.  
Have enhanced anticonvulsant activities.  
Depress reticular activating system. They also mimic the action of GABA by directly activating the GABA receptors.  
Has a rapid redistribution, half of the initial peak concentration is gone within 5 minutes.  
Brain receives only 10% of total dose of Thiopental  
Highly lipid soluble, and avidly binds mostly to albumin 72-86%.  
Protein binding of Thiopental in neonatal plasma (placental blood) is half that of adults. Possibly increasing the sensitivity.  
Fat is the only compartment in which Thiopental content continues to increase 30 minutes after injection.  
Will remain in fat for 2.5 hours and acts as a reservoir for maintaining plasma concentrations.  
Because of this, prompt awakening is not present with repeated doses due to the cumulative effect.  
This is why dose calculations of Thiopental should be based on lean body mass to avoid an overdose.  
**BP**  
In normovolemic patients, 5mg/kg IV produces a transient 10-20mm/Hg drop in BP that offset by a compensatory increase in HR by 15-20 BPM.  
**Ventilation:**  
The IV induction of Thiopental and other barbiturates produces a dose-dependent depression of medullary and pontine ventilatory centers.  
Patients with cirrhosis of the liver have the same clearance time of Thiopental with that of a normal person.  
Elimination halftime of Thiopental is prolonged with obese people because of its increased Vd.  
Elimination halftime of Thiopental is shorter in adults than infants, thus quicker recovery.  
It is longer in pregnant women.  
All due to protein binding.  
**Intra-arterial Injection:**  
Intra-arterial injection of Thiopental causes an immediate intense vasoconstriction. Excruciating pain that radiates throughout the artery results. Gangrene and permanent nerve damage could occur.  
**Intra-arterial Injection Treatment:**  
The goal is to re-dilate the artery.  
Lidocaine, Papavarine or Phenoxybenzamine can vasodilate.  
**pH of Thiopental:**  
Because the pH of Thiopental (7.6) is near blood pH, acidosis will favor the non-ionized fraction of the drug, whereas alkalosis has the opposite effect.  
The non-ionized form of the drug has higher lipid solubility to CNS.  
Acidosis favors non-ionized portion, and alkalosis has the opposite effect of Thiopental.  
So Acidosis increases intensity, and alkalosis decreases intensity of Thiopental.  
Redistribution of Thiopental to inactive tissue (not metabolism) is responsible for an early awakening following a single IV injection.
