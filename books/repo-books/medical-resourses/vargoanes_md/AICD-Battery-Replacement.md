### AICD Battery Replacement  

Basic MAC case that is much easer than the original insertion.

The cardiologist will open the pocket of skin where the pulse generator is located to replace the AICD pulse generator. The old pulse generator will be unplugged from the leads. The leads are checked to make sure they are still working properly. Then the leads are connected to the new AICD pulse generator. A test (defibrillation) is performed to make sure the new system is working properly. Once the AICD is working properly, the pocket will be stitched and closed.  

The battery life is dependent on what settings are programmed into the system. It is also affected by how much electrical therapy the patient receives from the generator.

**Anesthetic:** Usually a light MAC. We usually administer just a little Propofol or Amidate immediately prior to the local injection and defibrillation. The patient should also be slightly sedated with Versed. PEC I block is an option to decrease the level of needed sedation.  
**Duration:** 1 hour  
**Position:** Supine with arms tucked.  
**A-Line:** Not indicated  
**IV access:** 1 20 gauge is usually enough.  
**Neosynephrine drip:** Usually ok, but some cardiologists do not want you using it.  
**Diluted Ephedrine and Epinephrine:** Yes, have some handy.  
**Low Dose Propofol or Etomidate:** Yes, to deepen the patient when needed. 30mg of Propofol is a popular dose.

Remember, these patients have a low CO and EF, so it takes an extra minute or two to decrease their LOC. So don’t be impatient and end up administering too much sedation.

**Intubation equipment:** Always have everything ready in case the patient fails to return to a safe arrhythmia. That’s what we now call a code!  
  
**Crash Cart:** The EP staff will already have the patient connected to the defibrillator before the defibrillation test. Unfortunately, most EP nurses do not seem to have their emergency rescue meds drawn up. You should have some diluted Epinephrine readily available.  
**EBL:** Minimal

**Possible Complications**  
Problems with the new AICD working properly.  
Cardiac arrest with failure to convert.  
Surgical pocket infection.  
  
The ICD lithium battery can last up to seven years.
