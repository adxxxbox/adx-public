### VATS, or Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery

A minimally invasive procedure involving 3-4 small incisions to gain access to the pleural space. There is no painful rib spreading, “cracking” or dividing. The lung or other nearby structures is visualized using a thoracoscope and displayed on a high definition screen.

**Indications:**  
To biopsy suspicious lymph nodes or nodules on the lung or pleura.  
To clean fluid or infectious tissues out of the pleural space.  
Pulmonary resections.  
Lobectomy for lung cancer.  
To remove mediastinal masses.  
To do a Sympathectomy.  
To resect abnormal lung tissue for lung volume reduction surgery and many other thoracic procedures.

**Type and Crossed:** Yes, with 2 units of pack cells available prior to surgery.  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT (Left DLT).  
**Duration**: 1.5-3 hours.  
**EBL:** 100-500 mls.  
**DLT:** Males are usually 39F and Females 37F.  
**Bronchoscope:** Needs to be ready in the room before induction. A bronchoscopy is performed by the anesthesiologist or surgeon to verify Left DLT placement. Make sure you doubly secure the DLT with tape because if it moves out of place when going into the lateral position, the operative lung will not deflate when needed.  
**Large Hemostat or Kelly Clamp:** Have one available for clamping the DLT to deflate the appropriate lung.  
**Thoracic Epidural**: Usually. Make sure you bolus it before incision. It really helps limit intra-op and post-op pain.  
**IV Access:** 2 large bore, usually 18G  
**A-line:** Yes  
**Central Line:** Not as popular as before.   
**Labs:** We usually draw an ABG and a CBC from the A-line pre-op; but this depends on the procedure’s duration and estimates of EBL. An ABG is usually drawn about 15 minutes after one-lung ventilation is started.  
**Foley Catheter:** usually, especially if they have an epidural.  
**Neosynephrine Drip:** Yes  
**Position**: Lateral decubitus with affected (independent) lung up. An Axillary roll is needed and the bed will be flexed with the head and feet both downward. Extra pillows or folded blankets are needed between the abducted arms and for elevating the head to a neutral position. There are usually 4 people simultaneously positioning the patient in the presence of the surgeon. Make sure nothing is pushing against the DLT and you have easy access for clamping. Untangle the IV lines and have easy access to your A-line for ABGs.  
**Fluid warmer and warming blanket:** Yes, sometimes 2 warming blankets. These procedures are very prone to hypothermia, especially if it is an open chest.

**Ventilation:** When the lung is down, you need to immediately change your ventilator setting so you don’t over inflate and damage the remaining inflated lung. Some CRNAs switch to Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV) and limit their peak pressures (PIP) to 30 cm H20 and titrate with the ETCO2. Others just decrease the tidal volume in half. Try to keep PIPs below 40 cm H2O. You will need to increase your ventilator rate to compensate. Adding 3-5 cm H20 of PEEP is common. Increase O2 to 100%.  
If the dependent lung is healthy (with proper DLT placement), the patient may not experience any desaturations.

**You have a Decreasing SaO2?** This is common with one lung ventilation. First, attempt to manually ventilate the dependent lung by applying more PIP with some inspiratory holds through pulmonary recruitment: squeeze your bellows bag and maintain a safe peak pressure for 2-5 second intervals. Shoot for 30-40 cms H2O pressure. If that does not work, inform the surgeon and he will permit you to reinflate and ventilate the independent lung. Once the SaO2 returns to the desired baseline, you can deflate the independent lung again. This process may be repeated. Possibly several times.

**Reinflate the lung:** When the case is complete, the surgeon will ask you to reinflate the lung. Manually ventilate the patient up to 30 cm H20 until you see the lung reinflated. Place the patient back on your original ventilation settings because you are now ventilating both lungs.

**Chest Tube(s):** At the end of the case during closing, a chest tube(s) will be inserted and the surgeon may want to know how much volume you are losing. If your tidal volume is set on 700 mLs and you are only getting back 400 mLs, you are obviously losing 300 mls. This should improve when the chest tube(s) is connected to suction.

**Emergence:** Perform an AWAKE extubation with the head of the bed up in high fowler’s position if at all possible. Many times we roll the patient onto their stretcher and extubate them there. The stretcher seems to make it easier to extubate in high fowler’s position.  
  
**Complications:**  
Hemorrhage  
Vocal Cord Damage from the DLT insertion.  
Infection  
Trauma to surrounding organs.  
Pneumothorax  
  
**Advantages:**  
Shorter hospital stays.  
Decreased post-op pain and reduced usage of narcotics.  
Smaller post-operative scars.  
Earlier return to work compared to traditional “open” procedures.
