### Dexmedetomidine (Precedex) as an Adjuvant for Peripheral Nerve Blocks

Edited by Dr. Michael Kaminsky, Regional Anesthesiologist  
  
Dexmedetomidine, a selective α-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, is becoming more popular as a perineural adjuvant to the local anesthetic.  
  
**Low doses** of dexmedetomidine (30-50 mcg or 0.2-0.5 mcg/kg) as a perineural adjuvant have not been shown to induce hemodynamic instability.**Higher doses** of dexmedetomidine (50–150 mcg or 0.5–1.5 mcg/kg) as a perineural adjuvant have been associated with an increased risk of bradycardia, hypotension, and somnolence.   
**Common dosing by experienced anesthesia providers:** 20-30 mcg  
1:1 ratio with the volume of local anesthetic:  
20 mcg of dexmedetomidine for 20 mLs of local  
30 mcg of dexmedetomidine for 30 mLs of local  
  
**Advantages of Intraneural dexmedetomidine:  
**Believed to be effective for attenuating or preventing neural injury after inadvertent intraneural injection of local anesthetics.  
Anti-inflammatory properties  
Protective effects against neural injury  
It decreases blockade latency by around 19 %  
It Increases analgesia duration by around 60 %  
It decreases postoperative opioids by around 49%  
It decreases local anesthetic consumption by around 49%
