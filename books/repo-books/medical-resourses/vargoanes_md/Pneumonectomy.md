Pneumonectomy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Pneumonectomy

A pneumonectomy can be performed via a thoracotomy or a VATS. It is the surgical removal of an entire lung.

**Indications:**  
Lung cancer.  
TB  
Severe COPD.  
Multiple lung abscesses.  
Bronchiectasis.

Immediately following a pneumonectomy, air fills the space previously occupied by the lung, referred to as postpneumonectomy space, or PPS. Unlike other thoracic surgeries, a chest tube is NOT always inserted following a pneumonectomy, and the air is therefore not evacuated. Over time, a number of changes result in a decrease in the size of the PPS, including an elevation of the hemidiaphragm, a hyperinflation of the remaining lung, and shifting of the mediastinum towards the PPS. At the same time, there is progressive reabsorption of air in the PPS and its replacement with fluid.

**Type and Crossed:** Yes-have 2 units of pack cells available prior to surgery.  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT (Left DLT).  
**Inhalation agent:** Sevoflurane; many of these patients are smokers with COPD.  
**Duration:** 2-4 hours.  
**EBL:** 200-750 mLs  
**DLT:** Males are usually 39F and Females 37F. If the left lung is being removed, use a right DLT.  
**Bronchoscope:** Needs to be ready is the room before induction. A bronchoscopy is performed by the anesthesiologist or surgeon to verify DLT placement. Make sure you doubly secure the DLT with tape because if it moves out of place, the operative lung will not deflate when needed.  
**Large Hemostat or Kelly Clamp:** Have one available for clamping the DLT to drop or deflate the appropriate lung.  
**Thoracic Epidural**: Yes, and make sure you bolus it before incision. It really helps with intra-op and post-op pain. If you did not see a heart rate or pressure spike with incision, then your epidural bolus did well. 7mLs of 0.25% Marcaine with 3mLs of morphine usually does the trick.  
**IV Access:** 2 large bore, usually 18G.  
**A-line:** Yes, it should be placed on the dependent or lower side upper extremity.  
**Central Line:** Not as popular as before.   
**Labs:** We usually draw an ABG and a CBC from the A-line. This depends on duration of procedure and EBL calculations. An ABG is also usually drawn about 15 minutes after one lung ventilation is initiated.  
**Foley Catheter:** usually, especially if they have an epidural.  
**Neosynephrine Drip:** Yes.  
**Position**: Lateral decubitus with affected (independent) lung up. An axillary roll is needed and the bed will be flexed. Extra pillows or folded blankets are needed between the abducted arms and to elevate the head to a neutral position. There are usually 4 people simultaneously positioning the patient in the presence of the surgeon. Make sure nothing is pushing against the DLT and you have easy access for clamping. Untangle IV lines and have easy access to your A-line for ABGs.  
**Fluid warmer and warming blanket:** Yes, sometimes 2 warming blankets. In these procedures, especially if it is an open chest case, the patient is very prone to hypothermia.

**IV Fluids:** Keep them dry intra-op and post-op. You can replace volume blood loss with albumin or PRBCs instead of crystalloids.  
**Ventilation:** When the lung is down, you need to immediately change your ventilator setting so you don’t over inflate and damage the remaining inflated lung. Some CRNAs immediately switch to Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV) and limit the peak pressures (PIP) to 30cmH20 and then titrate the ventilation to the ETCO2. Others just simply decrease the tidal volume in half. Try to keep PIP’s below 40 cmH2O.

You will need to increase your ventilator rate to compensate. Adding 3-5 cm H20 of PEEP is common.  
Increase the O2 to 100%. When the dependent lung is healthy (with proper DLT placement), the patient may not experience desaturation issues.

**A Decreasing SaO2:** This is common with one lung ventilation. First attempt to manually ventilate the dependent lung by applying more PIP with some inspiratory holds (pulmonary recruitment). If that does not work, inform the surgeon and he will permit you to re-inflate and ventilate the independent lung that they are working on. Once the SaO2 returns to the desired baseline, you will drop the independent lung again. This process may be repeated.  
  
**Pressure check the pneumonectomy suture lines:**  
The surgeon may ask for a valsalva maneuver to check for a leak around the sutures. Close your pop-off valve and inflate the lung to 20-30 cmH20. Sometimes the surgeon will check for leaks by filling the cavity for water and look for air bubbles with positive pressure ventilation.  
  
**Chest Tube(s):** At the end of the case with closing, a chest tube(s) may or may not be inserted. If a chest tube(s) is inserted, it will not be hooked up to suction.

**Emergence:** AWAKE extubation with the head of the bed up (high fowlers). Many times we roll the patient on their stretcher and extubate them. The stretcher seems easier to extubate in the high fowlers position.  
  
**Complications:**  
Damage to Vagus Nerve.  
Pulmonary Edema.  
Right Heart Failure.  
Right lung has more complications than the left lung.  
Hemorrhage.  
Vocal Cord Damage from the DLT insertion.  
Infection.  
Trauma to surrounding organs.  
Pneumonectomy.  
Cardiac Herniation-Post Op. Compression of the IVC and SVC decreasing venous return and large pressure drops. Do not let the patient lie laterally with the postoperative side down.  
  
**Advantages (If a VATS is used)**  
Shorter hospital stays.  
Decreased post-op pain and reduced usage of narcotics.  
Smaller post-operative scars.  
Earlier return to work compared to traditional “open” procedures.
