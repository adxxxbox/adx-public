### Cervical Cerclage Cervical

Cervical cerclage is the placement of stitches in the cervix to hold it closed. This procedure is most often performed transvaginally.  
This is usually done preventively at 12 -14 weeks before the cervix thins out, or as an emergency measure after the cervix has thinned. It is rarely used after 24 weeks.  
Sutures are usually removed after the 38th week gestation without needing anesthesia.

**Indications:** To keep the incompetent cervix from opening early. When a cervix opens early, it may cause preterm labor and delivery.  
Damage to the cervix from a previous pregnancy termination  
A previous ‘cone biopsy’ or a LEEP procedure  
History of 2nd trimester miscarriages  
Previous cervical cerclage  
Previous emergent cerclage  
Abnormal cervix before conception  
  
**Anesthesia Considerations:**  
Avoid Nitrous and versed  
**Main Goal:** Avoid coughing or retching because it increases intrauterine pressure.  
Aspiration Risk  
Avoid Aortocaval compression, so utilize a left lateral tilt.  
Minimize hypotension and thereby placental insufficiency

**Anesthetic:** Spinal or General/ETT. Spinal is more popular.  
Epidural is optional, but rare.  
Spinal or epidural should cover both the cervical dermatomes (T10-L1), as well as vaginal and perineal dermatomes (S2-S4).  
**Popular spinal dose:** 10-20mcg of Fentanyl with 5.25mg of Bupivacaine.  
**Duration:** 15-30 minutes  
**IV Access**: 20G is acceptable for these  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**Position:** Lithotomy with a left lateral tilt of 15 degrees if gestational age >18 weeks (some books say 20 weeks). Foot of the bed goes down.  
**Common Diagnosis:** Incompetent cervix.

**Possible Complications:**  
Premature rupture of the membranes (PROM)  
Nausea and vomiting due to the anesthesia  
Cervical infection  
Premature contractions (unrelated to Braxton Hicks contractions)  
Cervix may not dilate correctly during labor  
Laceration on the cervix if labor begins before cerclage is removed  
  
**Neosynephrine or Ephedrine:** No,  
The low SAB dose usually does not result in hypotension.  
  
**Antiemetics:** If it’s a General- Bicitrate, Reglan etc.  
For spinals, usually not unless there are reflux issues.  
**Monitors:** Basic  
  
**Spinal Cases:** Very basic. Patient is wide-awake. We administer no narcotics or versed. Just put a NC on the patient, monitors and document vitals. Neosynephrine or ephedrine for BP as needed.  
  
**General/ETT:** Usually, for patients who want to be put to sleep. Sometimes these are done in the OR rather than an OB room.  
  
**LTA Kit with intubation:** Consider it, because coughing from the ETT irritation and vomiting acutely increase intra-uterine pressure. This could cause trauma to the fetal membranes during the cerclage placement. It also helps decrease coughing with emergence.  
**Muscle Relaxation with General:** Not needed if you can keep the patient from coughing or bearing down during the procedure.  
  
**Fetal heart rate monitoring:** Usually, depends on the facility.  
The major risk for cerclage is rupture of fetal membranes.

**More Notes**  
**Advantage of General Anesthesia**  
General Anesthesia is indicated if the cervix is dilated and fetal membranes are bulging. In this case, we want to avoid intrauterine and intra-abdominal pressure that may lead to further bulging and the rupture of the fetus membrane.  
  
Volatile gases relax the uterine smooth muscles and results in a decreased intrauterine pressure.
