Imperforate Anus (Anal Atresia) Review   

### Imperforate Anus (Anal Atresia) Review

Anal Atresia is a very serious condition that requires immediate treatment.

A birth defect that refers to a spectrum of anorectal abnormalities ranging from a membranous separation, to complete absence of the anus.  
Unfortunately, when there is a malformation of the anus, the muscles and nerves associated with the anus often have a similar degree of malformation.  
  
A major challenge for these repairs is creating an anal opening using nearby muscles and nerves so that the child can move the bowels normally and does not suffer from incontinence.

There is always a great risk of cutting sphincter muscles due to limited visualization through the small incisions.

  
**The Imperforate Anus is classified as a high or low malformation  
Low malformation:** The distal end of the rectum is below the levator ani muscle complex (closer to where the anus is or should be). These can be repaired with just a **Perineal Analplasty (Sacralperineal Pull-through)** not requiring a colostomy.  
  
**High malformation:** Is much more severe. The distal end of the rectum is above the levator ani muscle complex. With these, the patient gets a colostomy first. Then later when the patient has grown enough, the surgeon performs an **Abdominosacroperineal Pull-through** (a sacral approach to pull the bowel down to the anal sphincter.  
  
Both of the procedures above may vary from patient to patient depending on malformations present.  
To prevent the anus from narrowing, it may be necessary to periodically do anal dilations.

**Simply said:**  
Simple perineal anoplasty – For low malformations (infralevator).  
Temporary colostomy – For high malformations (supralevator).  
Extensive abdominosacroperineal – (supralevator).

**Another closely related procedure you may read about:  
**Posterior sagittal anorectoplasty (PSARP or Pena Pull-through procedure).

With anal atresia, there can be other anomalies that make the your anesthesia management more complicated.

**Other Anomalies Associated with Imperforated Anus (VACTERL)  
VACTERL association:** refers to the non-random co-occurrence of birth defects.  
V-Vertebral Anomalies- 6% overall, 24% have a tethered spinal cord.  
A-Anal Atresia  
C-Cardiac defects- 7% (VSD, ASD, PDA)  
T-Tracheo-esophageal anomaly-10-20%  
E-Tracheo-**e**sophageal anomaly-10-20%  
R- Renal anomalies 25-50% (solitary kidney, horse shoe kidney)  
L- Limb Defects

Patients may have spinal anomalies other than tethered cord, such as syringomyelia and myelomeningocele.

**  
May occur in several forms**  
The rectum may end in a pouch that does not connect with the colon.  
The rectum may have openings to other structures.  
  
**In Boys** - The anus may have fistula tracts with the urethra, bladder, base of the penis or scrotum.  
**In Girls** - The anus may have fistula tracts with the rectum, bladder and vagina-sharing one large opening (cloaca).1 in 5,000 birth  
More often in boys than girls  
**Genetic:** Tend to be sporadic with occasional familial forms  
  
Anal Atresia develops in utero during the fifth to seventh weeks of pregnancy. This also happens in conjunction with other defects of the rectum.

Some of these neonates may have vomiting secondary to obstruction, which poses a problem for fluid and electrolyte management. An enormous amount of fluid can be sequestered within the intestinal tract. This fluid is essentially extracellular fluid and has high sodium content.

Surgeons approached these malformations using a combined abdominal, sacral, and perineal approach.
