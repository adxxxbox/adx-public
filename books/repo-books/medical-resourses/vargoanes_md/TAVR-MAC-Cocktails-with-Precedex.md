TAVR MAC Cocktails with Precedex    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

#### Use of dexmetomidine (Precedex) for MAC (monitored anesthesia care) for TAVR (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement)

**_By Nickki Blanchette, CRNA_**  
Start them on 1mcg/kg/hr while you are starting second IV and A-line.  
In about 15 minutes the patient is very comfortable.  
We then titrate the Precedex down to 0.5-0.8mcg/kg/hr since the cardiologist likes to talk to the patient during the procedure.  
Once valve is deployed, we turn it off.  
In about 20-30 minutes and by the time you leave the operating room, the patient is very awake.  
I generally administer NO VERSED and once occasionally 12.5-25mcg of Fentanyl. Fentanyl helps maintain stable hemodynamics.

For the use dexmedetomidine in vascular and TAVR cases  
Begin infusion at 0.7 mcg/kg/hr on admission to the operating room.  
Limit midazolam (Versed) to a maximum dose of 2 mg (1 mg at a time).  
I rarely use Fentanyl is rarely required because if the surgeon uses local.  
Decrease the rate of administration of dexmedetomidine (Precedex) if sedation becomes excessive.  
This regimen is ideal for this sick patient population.  
Discontinue Precedex when drapes are being removed.
