### Antibiotic Prophylaxis for CABG

Prophylactic antibiotics should be administered 30-60 minutes prior to incision time. vancomycin should be started 1-2 hours before surgery and infused slowly to avoid the release of histamine.  
  
Antibiotic re-dosing is performed if the operation lasts longer than 3 hours.  
  
**Vancomycin** is reserved for the patient who is allergic to cephalosporins or has known or presumed methicillin-resistant S. aureus colonization.  
  
**If the MRSA screen is negative and there is NO Risk of MRSA.**  
1-2 grams of cefazolin in the operating room upon arrival.  
Dose: usually 2 grams for patients whose weight exceeds 80 kg.  
Re-dose Q4 hours.  
Protocols vary among institutions.  
  
**If answer is YES to any of the below questions, give Vancomycin and cefazolin (unless penicillin allergic).**  
Nasal swab positive for MRSA?  
History of MRSA?  
Currently receiving IV anibiotic(s)?  
Transferred from another inpatient facility?  
Standard vancomycin dose: 15mg/kg or 1 gram.  
  
**If beta-lactam allergy (PCN)**  
Aztreonam (Azactam) 1gram.  
  
**If allergic to vancomycin**  
Clindamycin.  
Give cefazolin in the operating room upon arrival. Start infusing vancomycin in the pre-op area over 1 hour.  
  
**Other Facts**  
Antibiotic protocols vary from facility to facility. First-generation cephalosporins **(e.g. Ancef)** have stronger gram‑positive coverage than the later generation cephalosporins.  
  
Staphylococcus aureus (gram positive) is the most common cardiac surgical infection.  
  
**Mupirocin -** the topical nasal antibiotic for all types of Staphylococcus aureus.  
Administer before surgery and continue 2-5 days postop.
