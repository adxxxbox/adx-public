### COX Inhibitors

Aspirin (ASA) is the only COX inhibitor used as an anticoagulant  
  
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) which leads to the reduction of prostoglandins and thromboxane A-2 from Arachidonic acid.  
  
**Thromboxane A-2  
**Thromboxane A 2 causes platelet aggregation.  
By blocking COX enzymes (mostly COX-1), this inhibits the Thromboxane A-2 and thus platelet aggregation.  
  
**Lab Monitoring:** There is no specific lab monitoring for ASA.  
**Optional Lab Monitoring Test consists of Platelet function tests**  
  
Arachidonic acid-based tests (Verify Now Aspirin Test)  
Multiplate  
Platelet Function Assay (PFA)  
PRP Aggregation  
  
**COX Antagonist**  
**Minor bleeding:** Desmopressin 0.3mcg/kg x 1  
  
Desmopressin has been known to increase platelet reactivity in patients treated  
with aspirin by releasing a greater number of von Willebrand multimers.  
  
**Tranexamic Acid**  
**Major bleeding:** Platelet transfusion  
  
If urgent surgery, transfuse platelets at least 90 minutes after the last dose of aspirin to allow it to clear from the circulation.  
  
rVIIA rarely used to reverse aspirin.
