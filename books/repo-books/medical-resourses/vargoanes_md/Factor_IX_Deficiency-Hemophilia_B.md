Factor IX Deficiency-Hemophilia B    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Factor IX Deficiency(Hemophiliac B or Christmas disease)

Originally named “Christmas disease” after the first person diagnosed with the disorder in 1952.  
  
Hemophilia B is a recessive X-linked bleeding disorder characterized by deficiency of the coagulation factor IX (FIX) where males are affected, with females being carriers.  
Multiple mutations have been described in the FIX gene.  
  
Recent evidence suggests that patients with hemophilia B have a less severe bleeding phenotype, a lower bleeding frequency, and better long-term outcomes (lower likelihood of joint arthropathy).  
  
The liver is the primary site of FIX synthesis. Hepatocytes directly secrete FIX into the plasma.  
  
The deficiency or mutation of FIX results in the reduction of a functioning intrinsic tenase complex, leading to diminished thrombin generation and an inability to form and maintain a stable clot.  
  
In hemophilia B patients, the severity of the bleeding phenotype is related to the degree of the FIX defect.  
Hemophilia B is clinically indistinguishable from hemophilia A.  
Hemophilia A and B can be differentiated by factor VIII and factor IX assays.  
Hemophilia A is 7 times more common than hemophilia B.  
Hemophilia B is the 2nd most common type of hemophilia and it is estimated to occur in one in 30,000 live male births across all ethnic groups.  
All races are affected equally.  
Like hemophilia A, the bleeding tendency in hemophilia B patients depends on the levels of FIX coagulant activity, classified as mild, moderate or severe.

| Classification | Factor VIII  
Activity % | Cause of hemorrhage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mild | \> 5-40 | Major trauma or surgery |
| Moderate | 1-5 | Mild-to-moderate trauma |
| Severe | < 1 | Spontaneous, hemarthrosis |

| Type of hemorrhage | Factor IX  
(units/kg) |
| --- | --- |
| Mild to moderate hemarthrosis or hematomas | 20-40 |
| Severe hemarthrosis or hematomas | 40-60 |
| Cranial Trauma | 50-100 |
| Primary prophylaxis | 30-40  
  
two times weekly |

  
For surgical prophylaxis, factor IX levels should be maintained > 50% for 7-15 days.  
  
**Management of anesthesia (with NO present factor IX Inhibitors)  
**Management of hemophilia A is similar to that of hemophilia B; administration of deficient factor IX. Recombinant or purified factor IX or factor IX prothrombin complex concentrate (PCCs) is used for mild bleeds or prophylaxis for mild bleeding episodes.  
  
Be careful administering PCCs, they are very prothrombotic.  
Factor IX has a half-life of 18-24 hours.  
Repeat ½ the original dose Q 12-24 hours to keep factor IX plasma levels > 50%.  
  
**Management of anesthesia (with factor IX Inhibitors)  
**Patients with no previous history of antibodies later in life can acquire (develop) specific antibodies (inhibitors) against their own factor IX. These patients respond poorly to the administration to recombinant factor IX.  
Instead of recombinant factor IX, PCCs are administered to patients with factor IX inhibitors.  
Only 3-5% of patients with hemophilia B develop inhibitors; 30-40% of hemophilia A patients develop inhibitors.  
  
**Treatment for Hemophilia B**  
Replacing the missing clotting factor FIX when bleeding episodes occur (on-demand treatment) or by scheduled infusions several times per week (prophylaxis).  
PCCs or recombinant (r)FIX clotting factor concentrates are suitable for these different strategies of hemophilia B management.  
Primary prophylaxis has become the optimal standard of care for severe hemophilia patients, shown to prevent joint damage, decrease the frequency of joint and other hemorrhages, and improve health-related quality of life.  
  
The goal of replacement therapy for hemophilia B is to achieve a plasma FIX level of 60%–80% for major bleeds and 20%-40% for minor bleeds.  
  
There are now several high-purity pdFIX concentrates commercially available.  
  
Unlike for hemophilia A, where there are multiple recombinant products licensed for treatment, only one rFIX product is currently available for hemophilia B.
