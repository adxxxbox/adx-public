### C-Section Emergency

A caesarean section (C-section) is a surgical delivery in which an incision is made through the abdominal wall and the uterus in order to deliver the fetus.  
  
Emergency C-section is performed when there is a concern for the health of the mother or baby.  
  
_In animal studies, fetal hypoxia occurred within 5-6 minutes of total cord occlusion. Fetal animals that were resuscitated after 15 minutes of cord occlusion suffered neurologic injury._  
  
**Four categories categorize the urgency of a C-section** . This anesthesia file pertains only to categories 1 and 2.  
**Category 1** \- Immediate threat to the life of the mother or baby. (ASAP)  
**Category 2** \- There are problems affecting the health of the mother and/or baby, but they are not  
immediately life threatening (Decision-to-incision time goal is 30 minutes)  
**Category 3** \- The baby needs to be delivered early but there is no immediate risk to mother or baby  
**Category 4** \- The operation will take place at a time that suits the woman and the caesarean section team  
  
_Realistically, most emergency caesareans are Category 2 and mostly are done about an hour after the decision is made.  
Life-threatening Category 1 caesareans should be done within 30 minutes._  
**Category 1 examples  
**Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE)  
Urgent C-section with potential massive hemorrhage  
Massive hemorrhage  
Prolapsed cord  
Profound fetal bradycardia  
Maternal hemodynamic collapse  
Eclampsia or active maternal seizures.  
  
**Decision delivery interval (DDI):** The time elapsed between the time the decision is made for the C-section and the time of delivery of the baby.  
Hospital protocols and interventions are designed to minimize DDI in an attempt to prevent maternal morbidity and neonatal morbidity and mortality.  
  
**Goal is DDI < 30 minutes**  
According to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) & American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendation, the surgical delivery should be accomplished within 30 minutes of the decision to proceed to emergency caesarean section.  
Level three medical institutions audit their DDI performance against the < 30 minute standard.  
  
**Note:** There is some evidence that DDI greater than ≥ 30 minute does not correlate with negative fetal outcomes. This further demonstrates that the anesthesia provider(s) needs to know the reason for the urgency of C-section and therefore know how quickly to respond.  
  
**In category I C-section, is it better to dose a working epidural, or to induce GETA?**  
It is preferable in many situations to induce general anesthesia and intubate immediately prior to incision, rather than to intubate hastily during the procedure while hemodynamics are unstable. Also, the patient will be in distress under these circumstances (unplanned surgery, life of self and infant threatened), and general anesthesia will decrease maternal stress and allow caregivers to work quickly and without distraction.  
  
**Redosing the the epidural vs General Anesthesia**  
The decision as to whether to redosing an working epidural placed for analgesia or to induce general anesthesia is made on a case-by-case basis. Good communication among all team members is paramount. The current condition of the fetus is an important consideration. The state of the mother also influences the decision. Ideally, members of a multidisciplinary perinatal care team will have discussed options and conducted case reviews and drills to validate and reinforce learning.  
  
**Emergency C-section local anesthetic doses  
**(see “Epidural Dose for C-Section-Urgent” in the OB section under the “Epidural Dosing” section)  
Most providers draw up **2% lidocaine 20 ml.  
**The second most frequent choice is **2-chloroprocaine 3%** 20 ml.  
  
If the patient has some degree of preexisting block from a working epidural used for labor analgesia, it may require as little as 10-15 ml. Always bolus in 5 ml increments and re-assess Q 5 minutes.  
  
**If possible, premedicate for aspiration risk  
**The incidence of aspiration in C-sections under general anesthesia is 1 in 400–600.  
Famotidine (Pepcid®) and sodium citrate/citric acid oral solution (Bicitra®) should be administered preoperatively.  
  
**Anesthesia for Emergency C-section  
Are equipment and drugs already drawn up?**  
Room preparation in anticipation of a possible C-section historically allowed for medications to be opened and drawn up, and equipment staged or prepared in advance. This is no longer possible because of evolving standards and guidelines. A room can be set up with unopened drug vials and packaged equipment conveniently available in such a way as to comply with these directives.  
  
**Thromboprophylaxis  
**Embolic phenomena remain a significant cause of postoperative morbidity.  
For general anesthesia, intraoperative calf compression, graduated elasticated stockings \[thrombo-embolus deterrent (TEDs)\] should be applied prior to induction.  
Indicated anticoagulant therapy should be considered and arranged.  
If neuraxial interventions have not been used, anticoagulant therapy may be started earlier.  
ASRA guidelines must be followed if neuraxial access has been made and especially if a catheter is present.  
  
**Preparation in accordance with institutional procedures:  
**Ensure consent form is signed  
Assess intravenous lines for patency and free running  
Ensure that required laboratory studies have been completed  
Ensure that all team members have been notified and informed of needs  
Summon any necessary available assistance  
Premedicate according to local protocol  
Complete other tasks required by local protocol  
  
**On patient arrival in the operating room**  
The patient is identified using two means of identification according to institutional guidelines and a “time out” is performed as prescribed by local practice. Transfer of the patient is expedited, and monitors are placed quickly. Left uterine displacement is provided. Fetal well-being is assessed as necessary using appropriate methods. Surgical preparation and draping are accomplished quickly prior to inducing general anesthesia. All team members verify that everything is in readiness prior to induction.  
  
**Pre-oxygenate**  
Ideally, induction of general anesthesia is preceded by pre-oxygenating the patient. This is accomplished by giving 100% oxygen through a properly-fitting face mask until the expired oxygen concentration is above 80%. This usually takes at least five minutes. This measure will improve the safety of general anesthesia. A trained assistant may be enlisted to hold the mask, or any other method that ensures a leakproof seal may be employed. Pre-oxygenation must not be interrupted during this interval.  
  
Pre-oxygenation in the described manner increases safe apnea time increasing the safety of relaxant administration and airway manipulation. FRC is markedly reduced in late pregnancy, especially in a supine patient, and little reserve exists. Oxygen saturation decreases much more quickly than normal due to these changes. It is optimal to have instructed all ancillary staff regarding the importance of pre-oxygenation. Removal of the face mask, e.g. in order to understand the patient’s conversation defeats the purpose of pre-oxygenation. Caregivers can more easily understand the patient’s verbalization by placing an ear closer to the patient’s mask.  
**  
Rapid-Sequence IV Induction**  
Neither sedatives nor opioids should be administered prior to delivery and the clamping of the umbilical cord. Cricoid pressure and bed tilt are controversial and a matter of preference. A final check that all is in readiness should immediately precede induction. Pre-treatment with a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant to “de-fasciculate” the patient is unnecessary and possibly harmful; term parturients may be more susceptible to their action. The chosen induction agent is given and followed immediately by succinylcholine in a dose intended to produce intubating conditions most rapidly.  
  
**Intubation  
**Failed intubation is almost 10 times more prevalent in an obstetric population than in the non-pregnant patient (1 in 300 compared to 1 in 3000).  
The rate of difficult intubation can be as high as 1 in 7 in the obese parturient.  
The incidence of aspiration in Caesarean section under general anesthesia is 1 in 400–600. It is therefore imperative to intubate the trachea with a cuffed tube as quickly as possible.  
  
A video laryngoscope or other difficult airway equipment should be readily available. If intubation cannot be accomplished within a safe apnea interval, then a properly-placed supraglottic airway (LMA or equivalent) should be placed before profound desaturation has taken place. In this instance, the risk of hypoxia is greater than that of aspiration. Aspiration, should it occur, may be treated and is preferable to the possible hypoxic encephalopathy that may result from protracted efforts to intubate.  
**_Note:_** _The use of supraglottic airway devices is an accepted part of obstetric difficult airway management.  
_  
**Secure the airway and inform the surgeon**  
When intubation has been completed and tube position verified, the surgeon is immediately informed. The incision will be made immediately, and surgical delivery is completed within the shortest time consistent with safety.  
  
The care of the neonate is undertaken by personnel other than those involved in the C-section. The composition of that team will vary among practices. All perinatal team members should ascertain how this is done in the individual institution.  
  
In case of severe maternal hemorrhage, the institution’s massive transfusion protocol should be activated. This protocol varies among institutions and all team members should familiarize themselves with the protocol in general and in their role in implementing it.  
  
Emergency C-section is difficult to manage. If skilled anesthesia help is available, those personnel should be called to assist.  
  
If the C-section has been completed uneventfully, emergence, extubation, and post-anesthesia care follow according to the procedures of the institution.  
  
**BP cuff:** Q 1 minute  
**OG Tube:** Recommended**IV access:** One or two IV catheters of minimum 18 gauge.  
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes  
**EBL:** C-sections done under general anesthesia have 200 more ml than a regional C-section  
**Epidural** may be used for pain management by injecting medications according to institutional protocol prior to removal of the catheter.  
**Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block** may be used for postoperative pain management. The block may be performed before the patient is discharged from the OR.  
  
**Postoperative analgesia:** A TAP block decreases the need for acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opioids.  
  
**Redose the epidural**  
If general anesthesia was performed, many anesthesia providers will redose the epidural prior to extubation.  
  
**Discontinue the epidural**  
Discontinue the epidural prior to leaving the operating room.  
  
**Possible complications of emergency C-section under general anesthesia**  
Pulmonary aspiration  
Difficult or failed laryngoscopy or intubation  
Failure of trial of extubation postoperatively  
Hemodynamic instability

Uterine atony  
Thromboembolism
