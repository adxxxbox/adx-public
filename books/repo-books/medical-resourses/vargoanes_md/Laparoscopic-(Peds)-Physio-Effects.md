Laparoscopic (Pediatric) Physiologic Effects   

### Laparoscopic (Pediatric) Physiologic Effects

Laparoscopy in the pediatric population is generally well tolerated. From a cardiac perspective, a common IAP \[Intra-Abdominal Pressure\] dependent physiologic response can be anticipated. When IAP is maintained at 10 to 12mmHg or less, clinically significant hemodynamic compromise is generally not observed; although increases in SVR (162%) and decreases in cardiac performance (67%) have been reported at pressures as low as 10 mm Hg.

Thus, it is advisable to minimize IAP, if surgical conditions & visibility allows, as a lower IAP is associated with fewer cardiac effects. As with adults, bradycardia and asystole can occur during gas insufflation due to vagal nerve stimulation. Children typically have a higher resting vagal tone, therefore initiating a pneumoperitoneum at a lower insufflation rate may be warranted.

**In children, the respiratory response to increased IAP and CO2 insufflation are magnified in comparison with adults.**  
From a mechanical standpoint, breathing in the pediatric population is more dependent on diaphragmatic movement than on thoracic cavity expansion (as in adults). Also, thoracic cavity compliance is higher in the immature chest cavity.

Due to increases in IAP, the diaphragm is pushed in a more cephalad direction with children, in turn decreasing their functional respiratory capacity. Diaphragm mobility decreases significantly, as does overall respiratory efficiency. Both respiratory rate and peak airway pressures will increase, and the respiratory changes appear to be more significant with intraperitoneal than extraperitoneal insufflation.

From a metabolic standpoint, CO2 absorption is much more efficient in children due to a relatively greater absorptive surface-to-weight ratio. To prevent excessive hypercarbia, minute ventilation should be increased, with close monitoring of end-tidal CO2 and arterial oxygenation in longer cases.
