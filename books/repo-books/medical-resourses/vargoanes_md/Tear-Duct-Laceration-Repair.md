### Tear Duct Laceration Repair

Any lid laceration medial to the pupil should be considered to involve the canalicular system until proven otherwise. This is because lesions of the lacrimal drainage system occur in up to 16% of all eyelid injuries.  
Canalicular lacerations are breaks (interruptions) in the normal tear duct drainage system. If not repaired promptly, tearing will usually result.

To repair the tear duct, a stent is placed inside it, running from the eyelid through the canaliculus, down the tear duct and into the nose. The stent is only 1 millimeter thick and made of very fine rubber. Stent placement minimizes the risk of canalicular scarring, prevents stricture and tearing following injuries to the medial aspect of the upper or lower eyelid(s).  

For anesthesia, we usually intubate the patient (retained muscle relaxation not needed) and rotate the bed 90 degrees. Most of the procedure involves the eye surgeon diligently searching for the damaged duct. That could take hours. Once the duct is located, a stent is inserted, sutures are applied and the procedure is complete.   
**Anesthesia:** General/ETT. Anectine is acceptable; this is not an open globe case.

**Duration:** 1-4 hours  
**IV Access:** 22G or 20G is only needed.  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**Position:** Supine, arms tucked to the sides and bed rotated 90 degrees.  
**Nose Bleed:** Sometimes post op  
Suction the oral pharynx pre-emergence. DO NOT nasally suction the nose with a catheter! It could suck the stent out.

It is OK for the patient to blow their nose, but not to sniff in.  
  
**More Notes**  
The stent may be left in for up to 6 months and is removed in the doctor’s office.

The canaliculi are the mucosal ducts through which tears drain from the eye. The canalicular portion of the tear drainage system is in the medial aspect of the lid. The lacrimal drainage apparatus consists of the puncta on the upper lid and the lower lid, the canaliculi, the common canaliculus, the lacrimal sac, and the nasolacrimal duct

**Canalicular Lacerations**

**Sex**  
Males > females  
**Age**  
Canalicular lacerations are most common in young adults. Canalicular lacerations in toddlers frequently result from dog bites. The mean age range is reportedly 18-30 years.

**Causes of Canalicular Lacerations**  
Dog Bites-Most common  
Assaults  
Falls and collisions  
Sharp trauma (eg, knives, coat hangers, fingernails, glass)  
Motor Vehicle Accidents  
Cat scratches  
Sports trauma. Sixty-six percent of all patients with a dog bit  
Midface trauma  
Iatrogenic nasolacrimal duct trauma can occur after endonasal surgical procedures
