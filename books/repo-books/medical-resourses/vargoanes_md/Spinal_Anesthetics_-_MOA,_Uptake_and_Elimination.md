### Spinal Anesthetics - MOA, Uptake and Elimination

**_Daniel D. Moos CRNA_**  
**NOTE** : _With spinal anesthesia, the site of action is not the spinal cord, but the spinal nerve roots and dorsal root ganglia._  
  
**Mechanism of Action**  
Local anesthetics administered in the subarachnoid space block sensory, autonomic, and motor impulses as the anterior and posterior nerve roots pass through the CSF. The site of action includes the spinal nerve roots and dorsal root ganglion.  
  
**Uptake & Elimination of Spinal Anesthetics Four factors affect the uptake of local anesthetics in the subarachnoid space:**  
Concentration of local anesthetic  
Surface area of neuronal tissue exposed  
Lipid content of the neuronal tissue  
Blood flow to the tissue  
  
**Why Spinal Anesthesia Onset is So Fast  
**Spinal nerve roots lack an epineurium and are easily blocked.  
The surface area of the exposed nerves allow for quick absorption of the local anesthetic.  
  
**Local Anesthetic in the CSF**  
As the local anesthetic travels away from the initial site of injection, its concentration decreases secondary to absorption into neural tissue and dilution by the CSF.  
Spinal cord tissue absorbs local anesthetics through the pia mater and the spaces of Virchow-Robin, which are extensions of the subarachnoid space. However, the site of action is not the spinal cord, but the spinal nerves and dorsal root ganglia.  
Local anesthetic concentration is highest at the site of injection.  
  
**Elimination with Spinal Anesthesia  
**Elimination occurs through vascular absorption in the subarachnoid and epidural space.  
Initial vascular uptake occurs through blood vessels in the pia mater and spinal cord.  
The rate of absorption is related to the vascular surface area that the local anesthetic comes into contact with.  
Lipid solubility of the local anesthetic solution enhances uptake into the tissue, further diluting the concentration.  
Local anesthetics also diffuse into the epidural space along a concentration gradient. Once in the epidural space, diffusion into the epidural vasculature occurs.
