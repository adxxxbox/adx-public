### Awake Craniotomy (AC)

**_Edited by Dr. Carmen Flesher, CRNA, DNP, Charlotte, NC  
  
_**AC is the performance of or at least part of an open intracranial procedure with the patient awake.  
These procedures were initially used for the surgical treatment of epilepsy.  
They are now also performed for the resection of tumors in the vicinity of some eloquent areas of the cerebral cortex which is essential for language and motor functions.  
  
They are also used for stereotactic brain biopsy, ventriculostomy, and supratentorial tumor resections  
  
The goal is to maximize a tumor resection while preserving neurological function.  
An awake responsive patient enhances this.  
  
During an AC, a patient is conscious as the surgeon stimulates different areas of the brain while asking the patient to perform certain tasks.  
These could be simple tasks such as just speaking, or things like identifying pictures with words.  
With the patient awake, the speech, motor and vision areas of the brain can be precisely mapped before tumor resection.  
This mapping minimizes the risk of new functional deficits that would be discovered postoperatively and allows for aggressive resection of the tumor.  
  
**Advantages of awake craniotomy:**  
Improved outcomes  
Greater extent of tumor resection  
Fewer late neurological deficits  
Shorter hospital stay  
Longer survival, especially after brain tumour resection.  
  
**Indications:**  
**Any intra-axial mass lesion residing adjacent to or in eloquent brain:**  
Broca area  
Wernicke area  
Arcuate fasciculus  
Insular brain  
Motor and sensory cortexes of the brain  
  
These are based on pre-operative imaging, including motor, and language cortex, and also cortex responsible for other functions, for example, frontal lobe-executive functions.  
The lesions are primarily Gliomas, cortical and subcortical.  
  
**Contraindications:**  
Unwilling patients  
Claustrophobia  
Anxiety disorders  
Apparent dysphagia  
Confusion or somnolence  
Alcohol or drug dependence  
Chronic pain disorders  
Restless legs syndrome  
Low pain toleranc  
Morbid obesity  
Obstructive sleep apnea  
Expected difficult airway  
Uncontrolled cough  
  
Some institutions routinely administer anticonvulsants and corticosteroids before surgery, whereas others, if the indication for AC is epilepsy, for example, withhold anticonvulsants to facilitate cortical mapping.**  
  
Avoid anticonvulsants for patients with seizures mapping.  
**Benzodiazepines should not be used in patients undergoing electrocorticography because they will suppress seizure foci and defeat the purpose of the procedure.  
  
**Types of mapping:  
**Motor  
Visual  
Language**  
  
Electrophysiological mapping and electrocorticographic recording:  
**Electrocorticography is an invasive electrophysiological technique in which cortical potentials are recorded directly from the brain surface in order to localize seizure foci (origin of seizure)Electrodes are placed on the brain surface above or near the suspected epileptic focus.  
Benzodiazepines can easily obliterate the cortical or subcortical signals, thus be avoided.General anesthesia limits the of medications that may alter cortical or subcortical signals and minimizes pharmacological interferences  
**Pre-op and what to prepare.  
**Zofran and glycopyrrolate should be administered in preoperatively by provider preference.

| Premedication | Comment |
| --- | --- |
| Anticonvulsants (e.g., levetiracetam) | Frequently administered to reduce the chance of perioperative seizure |
| Steroids (e.g. dexamethasone) | Normally administered to reduce peri-tumor edema |
| 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (e.g., ondansetron) | Nausea/vomiting prophylaxis |
| Neurokinin receptor antagonist (e.g., aprepitant) | Nausea/vomiting prophylaxis |
| Benzodiazepines (e.g., midazolam) | May adversely affect neurocognitive function; consider only if there is intractable anxiety |
| Opioids (e.g., fentanyl) | May cause nausea, itchy nose and dizziness; consider only if there is intractable pain |
| Tertiary anticholinergics (e.g., atropine or scopolamine) | May cause dry mouth and emergence delirium; not recommended |
| NSAIDs (e.g., acetaminophen) | Oral or IV Tylenol can be a useful analgesic adjunct |
| Antacids (e.g., famotidine) | May consider if gastroesophageal reflux disease |
| Metoclopramide | Possesses unwarranted neurologic effect, may cause dystonic reactions; not recommended |
| Droperidol | Previously used for neuroleptanalgesic anesthesia, may impede neurocognitive testing; not recommended |
| Clonidine | May cause hypotension and long-lasting sedation; not recommended |

  
**Scalp and forehead sensory innervation:**  
**It occurs with:**  
Trigeminal and spinal nerves  
Ophthalmic  
Maxillary  
Mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve innervate the scalp and forehead regions.  
  
**Six nerves to blocked bilaterally:  
**Supraorbital nerve  
Supratrochlear nerve  
Auriculotemporal nerve  
Temporozygomatic nerve  
Greater occipital nerve  
Lesser occipital nerve  
**  
Anesthetic:  
Medications to limit or avoid because they may affect neurocognitive function and/or lead to confusion or delirium:**Midazolam  
Atropine  
Scopolamine  
Large dose of fentanylHowever, a small dose of 1-2 mg midazolam IV is beneficial in highly anxious younger patients with normal pre-operative neurologic function.  
  
**Precedex as an alternative:**  
A bolus of precedex can be administered preoperatively for sedation to avoid the medications listed above.  
Precedex is not associated with intraoperative delirium when a patient awakes to find Mayfield pins are in place.  
**Three anesthetic approaches to awake craniotomy:**  
1) Asleep–awake–asleep (GA–awake–GA)  
2) Awake–awake–awake  
3) Sleep-awake-awake  
**  
1) Asleep–awake–asleep**  
**The patient is asleep for the most stimulating parts:  
**Scalp block and Mayfield application  
Craniotomy and opening of the dura are performed while the patient is sleeping  
The patient should be awake during intradural operation and during closure period.  
  
The patient is induced with propofol followed by the insertion of an LMA or ETT for positioning and craniectomy portion.  
Once the dural is opened and the brain is exposed, the LMA or ETT is removed apon the surgeon’s request.  
The brain lacks pain receptors.  
The surgeon will wait for the patients to be awake for the mapping and resection.  
Patients tolerate Mayfield pins despite how painful they look.  
The LMA or ETT is reinserted for the closure  
  
**Airway management with awake craniotomy:  
**During the sleeping part, airway management techniques may be:  
Endotracheal tube  
LMA  
Face mask  
Nasal cannula  
Nasopharyngeal airway  
  
**The Proseal LMA** is popular because it is easier to be positioned.  
It permits controlled ventilation avoids airway obstruction and obstruction is avoided.  
It also allows the transition to awake status is more comfortably.  
  
**Importance of securing the LMA:  
**The LMA may become malpositioned with positioning resulting in an air leak and ineffective ventilation causing undesired hypercapnia.  
  
**Optimal, but not common:** Avoidance of an LMA or ETT altogether and use a NC with an EtCO 2 sampling channel.  
The nasal cannula is taped to the cheeks.  
Sometimes a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal airway is needed  
The insertion may be facilitated by propofol sedation and lidocaine paste.  
**Disadvantage:** Airway obstruction and hypoventilationIf airway obstruction and hypoventilation occurs with a propofol infusion, one can add a continues infusion of dexmedetomidine while minimizing or discontinue the propofol and remifentanil infusion to awaken the patient  
  
**Bilateral nasopharyngeal airways (not common):  
**Some institutions insert bilateral nasopharyngeal airways and attach one to a Some institutions use unilateral or bilateral nasopharyngeal airways  
attached to a salter nasal cannula or breathing circuit in patients who are spontaneously breathing but deeply sedated.  
  
**Disadvantage:** Unable to apply positive pressure ventilation  
  
**Coughing and laryngospasm:**  
Laryngospasm and cough that develop during airway maneuvering between sleeping and awake periods.  
  
**This may result in:**  
Increased surgical bleeding  
Increased intracranial pressure or injury  
  
Airway manipulation should be avoided during the transition between the sleeping and awake periods,.  
Continuous positive pressure can be applied with anaesthesia circuit to avoid obstruction with OSA patients  
  
**3 common simultaneous continuous infusions awake craniotomies:  
****Propofol 50–150+ mcg/kg/min**  
Stop at least 15 min before EEG recording and it may still leave a residual EEG traces characterized by high-frequency and high-amplitude beta activity, which covers abnormal activity  
  
**Dexmedetomidine 0.3 to 0.7 mcg/kg/hr:  
**0.1–0.5 mcg/kg.hr during brain stimulation provides appropriate conditions for functional tests (speech mapping and electrocorticography).  
It is preferred because it does not cause respiratory depression and does not interact with electrocorticography.  
  
**Remifentanil 0.1–0.2 mcg/kg/min:  
**Other opioids, such as fentanyl, alfentanil and sufentanil, can be used.  
If narcotics are used, consider administering the antiemetics ondansetron and/or dexamethasone.  
  
The surgeon should give 10-15 mins heads up for when they need to be awake so you can shut down all medications.  
Have boluses on hand (especially if pediatric) in case of a delirious wake up to avoid ripping out of pins.  
With a good airway, remove the LMA deep and place a salter NC on with soft nasal airway placed in the nares or mouth if needed until awake.  
Once awake, small doses of fentanyl can be used for pain.**  
  
Once mapping is completed:**  
Once mapping is completed and patient cooperation is no longer needed, you can also choose awake, spontaneous ventilation under light or deep sedation, or GA with airway control.  
Sedation is often adequate.  
The patient usually requires lower rates of sedative infusions during the post awake phase than during the pre-awake phase as patients are often fatigued, and there is a lower level of painful stimuli during skull closure.  
  
**2) Awake–awake–awake:**  
The patient will be awake with moderate conscious sedation while maintaining spontaneous ventilation.  
The patient should be able to give a meaningful response to verbal or tactile stimuli.  
Excessive sedation should be avoided.  
Sedation is applied at the beginning of the process in which the stimuli are provided, reduced or cut off during cortical mapping and repeated during the closure period.  
  
**During the mapping phase:  
**With both approaches, NO medications are usually administered as the cranium and sensitive dura are no longer being stimulated.  
  
**Pediatrics and mapping:**  
When doing pediatrics, it’s common to leave low dose precedex running as their anxiety can be a little higher.  
  
**When mapping is completed:**  
Once mapping is completed and patient cooperation is no longer needed, you can also choose awake, spontaneous ventilation under light or deep sedation, or GA with airway control.  
  
The patient usually now requires lower rates of sedative infusions during the post awake phase than during the pre-awake phase as patients are often fatigued, and there is a lower level of painful stimuli during skull closure.  
Precedex (0.3mcg/kg/hr) and propofol (50mcg/kg/hr) with small boluses of fentanyl is common.  
  
**3) Sleep-awake-awake:  
**Scalp block, Mayfield application, craniotomy and opening of the dura are performed while the patient is sleeping.  
The patient should be awake during intradural operation and the remaining of the procedure.  
  
**Airway:** Patient selection is key, as it is hard to keep a patent airway in a patient with significant obesity or sleep apnea**Regional:** Surgeon will place scalp blocks prior to applying Mayfield pins.  
**Induction:** Lidocaine and propofol for LMA placement**Nitrous?** Not usually**Muscle Relaxation:** None (some institutions paralyze in the beginning to take over breathing)**Position:** Dependent on the tumor. See details below  
**Duration:** 2-5 hours  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 2 18/20g IVs**A-line:** Always and usually in the ipsilateral arm to the brain lesion so as not to interfere with the sensorimotor monitoring of the arm that is contralateral to the brain lesion.  
**Age Range:** Mature 9 years and up.**EBV:** Variable**Emergence:** Usually deep with/without airway to keep from coughing  
**How we treat a drop in BP:** Patient dependent but usually small doses of phenylephrine are sufficient.**Foley catheter:** Not routine due to patient discomfort.  
One may be considered when the procedure is expected to last > 4 hours or when intraoperative mannitol is administered. (17).  
Limit fluids to 50-100 mL per hour.  
  
**To limit discomfort with Foley catheter insertion:** The application of urethral is often used for minimizing catheter-related urinary irritation,  
  
**Patient positioning:  
**Supine, lateral or semi-lateral positionThe operating room bed is typically turned 90° (in reference to the anesthesia workstation) to either left or right depending on the side of the brain lesion.  
The patient should be facing you and the anesthesia workstation, which optimizes face-to-face interaction and airway management.  
**Head positioning:**  
A minor turn of the patient’s head (away from the lesion side) is frequently applied for the semi-lateral patient to facilitate surgical access.  
**Apply sniffing position:** This aids in optimizing airway patency prior to securing the head frame to the operating room bed at the start of the procedure.  
  
Avoid over-flexion or rotation of the head for reduce airway obstruction and difficulty in airway management  
  
Discomfort from prolonged positioning is the biggest complaint from remaining in the same position for a long time.  
  
**Mayfield pins:**Most institutions secure the patient’s head with Mayfield pins after infiltrating the pin sites with local anesthetics.  
The pins prevent the head from moving, but it makes manipulation of the head/neck position during airway emergency difficult.  
Avoid panicking and trying to manipulate the airway without the cooperation of the surgeon because there is a risk of lacerating the scalp with the pins.  
  
Some institutions support the head on a horseshoe frame.  
  
**Monitoring:  
Pulse oximetry:** Place the probe on the finger or toe that is ipsilateral to the brain lesion to prevent the oximetry cable from limiting the range of motion of the arm that is contralateral to the brain lesion.  
  
**Possible Complications:  
**HTN during awake phase is most commonly secondary to pain, agitation, and anxiety. Treatment should focus on managing the cause.  
Labetalol or esmolol may sometimes be necessary for hypertension.  
  
Seizures can be treated quickly with propofol boluses, but also, there should be iced saline on field to flood the brain if seizure activity is note.  
N/V: commonly associated with opioids. Limit use and try to limit gas used. Treat preoperatively with Zofran and decadron.  
**  
More Notes:  
**Try to discuss foley catheter avoidance in the pediatric population as this causes distress.  
External catheters or in and out prior to them being awake is often enough.
