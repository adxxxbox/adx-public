**Interactions:** Acetaminophen  
**Anesthetic Implications:** Inhibits CYP450 2E1 enzyme.  
**Licorice  
Uses:** To relieve gastric and duodenal ulcers  
**Effects:** May mimic effects of aldosterone (NA+H2O retention and decreases. K).  
Can be confused with Conn Syndrome.  
**Interactions:** Oral contraceptives.  
Licorice may change hormone levels in the body and decrease effectiveness of estrogen containing medications like conjugated estrogens (Premarin), ethinyl estradiol, and estradiol (Estrace).  
Prednisolone, Hydrocortisone: May increase both their medicinal effects and undesirable side effects.  
**Anesthetic Implication:** Potentiates cutaneous vasoconstrictor response. Hypertension, edema, hypokalemia  
**Marijuana  
Uses:** For pain, nausea and vomiting, and pleasure.  
**Effects:** Cortical- antiemetic.  
The effects of cannabis on the body are mostly due to two of the cannabinoids (cannabidiol & cannabinol), THC, and its metabolites.  
**Cannabinol:** Decreases intestinal motility and is a potent prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor.  
**THC** Is carried in the lipid- containing constituents of the plasma, where it is eventually distributed to and absorbed by the various fatty tissues.  
**Interactions:** Cannabidiol potentiates barbiturate sleeping time, has anti-epileptic properties (that go away with chronic use), and decreases the rate of serotonin uptake.  
It may potentiate NMDR due to anticholinergic effects of THC.  
THC is a good substrate that competitively inhibits any drug dependent upon the nonspecific enzyme system for metabolism.  
Any drug which causes respiratory or cardiac depression may have its effect augmented by cannabis.**Physiologic Effects of Cannabis  
CV Acute effects:** Tachycardia, vasodilation, orthostasis. Depresses calcium dependent ATPase activity of the cardiac muscle sarcoplasma, resulting in arrhythmias or EKG changes.**CV Chronic effects:** Atheromatous Disease  
**Pulmonary Acute effects:** Bronchodilation, hyperreactivity, airway edema  
**Pulmonary Chronic effects:** Chronic bronchitis, emphysema.**Central Nervous system Acute effects:** Anxiolysis or anxiety, paranoia, psychosis, euphoria, dizziness, H/A, memory dysfunction, analgesia.**Central Nervous System Chronic effects:** Similar to acute effects, tolerance develops requiring higher doses.  
Can deplete acetylcholine stores by as much as 50%, so it is considered to have an anticholinergic effect.  
Impairs temperature regulatory mechanism.**GI Acute effects:** Antiemetic, increased appetite, abdominal pain.  
**GI Chronic effects:** Hyperemesisàcan lead to hyperemesis syndrome.  
**Endocrine Acute effects:** None  
**Endocrine Chronic effects:** Gynecomastia, anovulation, galactorrhea.**  
Acute Cannabis Intoxication:**  
Assess for symptoms of escalating anxiety, paranoia, or psychosis, because these may result in a more violent emergence from anesthesia. In addition, episodes of cannabis-induced psychosis, especially after use of higher potency THC formulations, can co-present with fever, tachycardia, and hypertension.**Anesthetic Implications:** May result in pulmonary edema, respiratory depression, cardiac arrhythmias.**  
Preoperative:  
**Elevated risk of myocardial infarction within 1hour after THC use.  
Airway hyperreactivity  
Anxiety/paranoia  
Psychosis  
Need to assess for other drugs  
**Intraoperative:  
**Tolerance to induction drugs (with chronic use)  
Elevated Bispectral index  
Unknown cross tolerance to other anesthetic agents  
Elevated risk of Myocardial infarction within 1hr after use.  
Airway hyperactivity  
**Postoperative:  
**Unknow cross-tolerance to analgesics  
Possible heightened pain perception  
Withdrawal  
  
**St. John's Wort  
Uses:** For antidepressant, insomnia, OCD, and ADHD.

**Interactions:**  
SSRIs/MAOIs- serotonin syndrome  
Decreased efficacy with warfarin, digoxin, phenytoin/carbamazepine and antiretrovirals.  
Reduces serum concentration of cyclosporine leading to increased risk of organ rejection.  
Has additive serotonin effects with sumatriptan.**Anesthetic Implications:** Induces CYP 3A4 and 2C9 and so affects metabolism of drugs including alfentanil, midazolam, lidocaine, calcium channel blockers, serotonin receptor antagonists, protease inhibitors, cyclosporine, oral contraceptives, warfarin, and digoxin.  
  
**Valerian

**Interactions:** May potentiate barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and haloperidol.  
**Anesthetic Implications:** May potentiate drugs affecting GABA; possible hepatotoxicity and acute pancreatitis.  
  
**Vitamin C  
Uses:** A micronutrient essential for human health, obtained from food.  
**Effects:** \>2,000mg/day may cause adverse events. 3-5g/day may cause diarrhea and bloating.  
**Interactions:** May interact with warfarin and increase bleeding.  
**Anesthetic Implications:** Precipitate hemolysis in patients with glucose 6- phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.  
  
**Vitamin E  
Uses:** Lipid-soluble antioxidant in human plasma and tissues, indicated in many biological activities  
**Effects:** Recommended is 15mg/day.
