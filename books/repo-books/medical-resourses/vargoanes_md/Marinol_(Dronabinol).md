Marinol (Dronabinol    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Marinol (Dronabinol

**Brand name:** Marinol®, Adversa, Syndros, and Reduvo  
**Generic name:** Dronabinol (synthetic delta-9 THC)  
**Drug class:** Miscellaneous antiemetics  
THC (delta 9) can reduce nausea, emesis, and pain in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.  
  
**Simplified cannabinoid review:  
**There are over 120 cannabinoids in the cannabis plant.  
Some are psychoactive (THC), and many are not (CBD, CBGA, CBN, etc.).  
Our body has its own natural cannabis system that helps maintain homeostasis.  
The cannabinoids our body produces are related to the cannabis plant.  
The most studied cannabinoid receptors in the human body are CB1 and CB2.  
These receptors are within every system in the body.  
Using animal models, CBD has been shown to inhibit the progression of many types of cancer, including glioblastoma (GBM), breast, lung, prostate, and colon cancer.  
  
**Dronabinol:**  
\- Dronabinol, the active ingredient in Marinol®.  
\- Dronabinol is a synthetic delta-9­ THC and a schedule III-controlled substance.  
\- Dronabinol is psychoactive (can make you high).  
\- Marinol is not approved for ages < 18 years old.  
\- It may decrease opioid use perioperatively.  
**\- Off-label use:** Preoperative antiemetic for high-risk PONV patients.  
\- Applying TIVA is common when a patient is administered Marinol® for PONV.  
**Marijuana joint vs Marinol®:**  
\- According to a Drug and Alcohol Dependence study conducted in 2016, a typical marijuana joint has a total of 20 mg of THC.  
\- The bioavailability of THC from a joint is about 30%.\- Only 10-20% of a 5 mg dose of Marinol® is bioavailable.  
  
**Prophylaxis for PONV:**  
\- Many anesthesia providers are using Marinol® instead of the scopolamine patch in high-risk-PONV elderly patients due to fewer side effects.  
\- It can be administered concomitantly with a scopolamine patch in nonelderly patients.  
\- It is administered as a one-time dose about an hour before surgery.  
  
**MOA:** Partial agonist of cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2.  
\- Dronabinol has complex effects on the CNS, including central sympathomimetic activity.  
  
**Indications per FDA:**  
\- Anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS.  
\- Nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments.  
  
**Pre-operative dosing for high-risk PONV patients:  
**5 mg PO 30-60 minutes before surgery.  
  
**Elderly:** 2.5-5 mg  
Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the neuropsychiatric and postural hypotensive effects.  
Elderly patients who never used recreational THC may be more sensitive.  
  
**Dosing before chemotherapy:**  
\- The recommended starting dosage is 5 mg administered 1 to 3 hours prior to the administration of chemotherapy, then every 2 to 4 hours after chemotherapy, for a total of 4 to 6 doses per day.  
\- Administer the first dose on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before eating; subsequent doses can be taken without regard to meals.  
**Route:** PO, 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg capsules  
**Onset (PO):** 0.5 to 1 hour and peak effect at 2 to 4 hours.Duration of action for psychoactive effects is 4 to 6 hours, but the appetite stimulant effect of dronabinol may continue for 24 hours or longer after administration.**  
Possible adverse reactions:**  
Euphoria  
Abdominal pain  
Dizziness  
Nausea  
Paranoid reaction  
Somnolence  
Thinking abnormal  
Vomiting  
  
**Contraindications:** History of a hypersensitivity reaction to dronabinol or sesame oil.  
  
**Warning and precautions:**  
**Neuropsychiatric adverse reactions:**  
Marinol® may cause psychiatric and cognitive effects and impair mental and physical abilities.  
Avoid use in patients with a psychiatric history.  
  
**Hemodynamic Instability:**  
Patients with cardiac disorders may experience hypotension, hypertension, syncope or tachycardia.  
The patient should avoid concomitant use of drugs with similar effects and monitor for hemodynamic changes after initiating or increasing the dosage of Marinol®.  
  
**Seizures and Seizure-like Activity:**  
May increase the risk of seizures.  
  
**Possible serious side effects:**  
**Drug and alcohol abuse.** There is an increased risk of abusing Marinol® in patients with a history of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence, including marijuana.  
**Multiple Substance Abuse:**  
Assess risk for abuse or misuse in patients with a history of substance abuse or dependence before prescribing MARINOL and monitor for the development of associated behaviors or conditions.  
**Pharmacokinetics:  
Absorption:** 90 to 95% after single oral doses  
  
**Only 10 to 20% reach systemic circulation.**  
The combined effects of first-pass hepatic metabolism and high lipid solubility result in only 10 to 20% of the administered dose reaching the systemic circulation.  
**  
Distribution:**  
Dronabinol has an apparent volume of distribution of approximately 10 L/kg because of its lipid solubility.  
The plasma protein binding of dronabinol and its metabolites is approximately 97%.  
  
**Metabolism:**  
\- Dronabinol undergoes extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism, primarily by hydroxylation, yielding both active and inactive metabolites.  
\- The liver primarily metabolizes THC via cytochrome P450 (CYP-450) isozymes CYP2C19 and CYP3A4.  
\- Some THC can be metabolized outside the liver in tissues that express CYP-450, such as the brain, but the liver serves as the main site of metabolism via its microsomal system  
  
**Principal active metabolite:** 11­ hydroxy-delta-9-THC  
\- Dronabinol and 11­ hydroxy-delta-9-THC are present in approximately equal concentrations in plasma.  
\- Published _in vitro_ data indicates that CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 are the primary enzymes in the metabolism of dronabinol.  
\- CYP2C9 appears to be the enzyme responsible for forming the primary active metabolite.  
  
**Excretion:**  
\- Dronabinol and its biotransformation products are excreted in both feces and urine.  
\- Biliary excretion is the primary route of elimination, with about half of a radio-labeled oral dose being recovered from the feces within 72 hours as contrasted with 10 to 15% recovered from urine.  
\- Less than 5% of an oral dose is recovered unchanged in the feces.  
  
Following single-dose administration, low levels of dronabinol metabolites have been detected for more than five weeks in the urine and feces.  
  
**Pregnancy:  
**\- Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid the use of Marinol® during pregnancy.  
\- No teratogenicity has been reported.  
  
**Lactation:**  
\- Advise HIV-infected women with anorexia associated with weight loss not to breastfeed.  
\- Advise women with nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy not to breastfeed during treatment with Marinol® and for nine days after the last dose  
  
**Extra notes:  
The two primary cannabinoid receptors:**  
\- Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1)  
\- Cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2)  
\- Both of which are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) on the cell surface  
  
**CB1 and CB2 receptors**  
**CB1 receptors:**  
\- Most abundant in the central nervous system, specifically in the cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, contributing to cannabinoids’ effects on memory, cognition, movement and nociception.  
\- CB1 receptors are found in the intestine, liver, pancreas, immune system, heart, vascular system and reproductive system but at lower receptor density.  
\- CB1 receptors can also form homo- and heterodimers with other CB1 receptors and GPCRs to modulate receptor signaling.  
\- Various neural functions have been suppressed in CB1 knock-out mice or the presence of a - CB1 antagonist (SR141716A). Specifically, blocking the CB1 endocannabinoid receptor can suppress appetite and feeding behaviors, the extinction of aversive memories, cerebellum-dependent discrete motor learning, drug addiction, and neuroprotection following closed-head injuries.  
  
**The CB2 receptor:  
**\- CB2 shows a greater variation amongst different species when compared to the CB1 receptor.  
\- CB2 receptors are most abundant in immune cells, specifically B-cells and natural killer (NK) cells, where stimulation of these receptors can modulate immune function.  
\- Less pronounced receptor densities of CB2 are found in the adrenal gland, lung, myocardium, vascular smooth muscle, testis, prostate, bone and some tumors.  
\- CB2 receptors are essential for immune system function, specifically B-cells and natural killer (NK) cells.  
  
**Marinol® may decrease opioid use perioperatively.  
**A study also found a decrease in opioid use in the first 48 hours after initiation of treatment.  
Ladha et al. and Davidson et al. also cite a retrospective study from a center that used dronabinol off-label for pain control primarily in patients with prehospitalization cannabis use.
