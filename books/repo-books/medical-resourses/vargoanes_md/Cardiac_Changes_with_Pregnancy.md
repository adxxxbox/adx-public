### Cardiac Changes with Pregnancy

Increase in heart size up to 50%  
O2 Consumption ↑ 30-60%  
Cardiac Output ↑ 40-50%  
Postpartum CO ↑ 75%  
HR ↑ 15-20 bpm (17%)  
Stoke volume ↑ 30%  
SVR ↓ 20%  
PVR ↓ 30%  
CVP no change  
PCWP no change  
MAP no change  
Uterine perfusion ↑ 700-900 mL/min (20% of CO)  
  
**Uterine contractions:** During uterine contractions, as much as 500 mLs of blood is expelled from the uterus into the maternal circulation.  
Elevation of the diaphragm by a growing uterus shifts the heart left and anterior.  
The heart's PMI is displaced cephalad to the fourth intercostal space and also to the left at midclavicular line.  
  
**Heart Sounds**  
S1 is accentuated  
Grade II systolic ejection murmur.  
Possible presence of S3 and S4 (S4 in 14% of pregnant patients).  
Leftward placement of PMI.  
  
**Heart Size  
**LV Hypertrophy by 12 weeks and 50% increase in heart mass by term.  
This enlargement is from an increase in the size of the preexisting cardiomyocytes and not from an increase in the number of cells.  
  
**Decreased SVR  
**A decreased SVR occurs due to the vasodilatory effects of progesterone and the proliferation of low resistance vascular beds in the inter-villous spaces of the placenta.  
  
**Cardiac Output**  
Early pregnancy is characterized by high flow – low resistance.  
6 weeks gestation there is an increased HR, but no change in CO.  
By term, the CO is increased up to 50%.  
The increased in CO results in increased perfusion to the uterus, kidneys and extremities.  
Uterine blood flow increases from 50mL/min to 700-900 mL/min.  
90% of the blood flow to the uterus will perfuse the intervillous space.  
  
**Blood Pressure**  
BP decreases despite the increased cardiac output due to the lower SVR. The diastolic pressure tends to fall more than systolic pressure, the maximum decline is noted around mid gestation. Diastolic pressure may fall as much as 20% and systolic by around 8%.  
  
**Annular diameter of heart valves  
**The mitral, tricuspid, and pulmonic valve diameter increase.  
94% of pregnant women display tricuspid and pulmonic regurgitation.  
27% display mitral regurgitation.  
  
**EKG Changes  
**Left axis deviation  
ST segment depression  
T wave flattening  
  
The heart is physiologically dilated and displaced in both cephalad and lateral directions. A normal pregnancy ECG may have 15–20° left axis deviation and T waves may be inverted in lateral leads and lead III mimicking left ventricular hypertrophy and other structural disease.  
  
**IV starts are easier**  
Peripheral vasodilatation (especially of the arms) makes it easier to start an IV on these patients.  
  
**Cardiovascular Notes  
**Blood volume slowly increases by 40-50%.  
This is mainly due to an increase in plasma volume through increased aldosterone.  
This causes an increase in heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output.  
  
Cardiac output increases by about 50%, mostly during the first trimester. Cardiac output rises from 4 to 7 liters in the 2nd trimester.  
(this timeline seems to contradict itself somewhat).  
  
Diastolic blood pressure decreases between 12–26 weeks, and increases again to pre-pregnancy levels by 36 weeks.  
After pregnancy the change in stroke volume is not immediately reversed.
