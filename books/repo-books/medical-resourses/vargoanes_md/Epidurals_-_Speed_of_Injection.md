Epidural - Speed of Injection    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Epidural - Speed of Injection

**Speed of injection:** Bromage tested the influence of speed of injection on the incidence of patchy sacral analgesia and found that SLOW injections (0.5 ml/sec) decreased the incidence from 30% down to 6% in human volunteers. This holds especially true for single-port epidural catheters.  
  
**Multiport Epidural Catheters Require a Faster Injection** With multiport catheters, slowly injected fluids preferentially exit the most proximal multiport catheter hole while approximately equal fluid volumes exit each hole during rapid injection.  
  
Effective epidural test doses must test the distal hole.  
  
The minimum injection speed needed to obtain flow through all three catheter ports (threshold speed) varies with catheter diameter.  
  
There is similar pressure between the epidural veins and the epidural space. This means the resistance to inject the test dose should be fairly equal.  
  
While in the subarachnoid space, the CSF pressure is 1.7–15 mmHg higher than resting epidural space pressure.
