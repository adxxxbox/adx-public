### Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) Genetics

MH is “autosomal dominant” with “variable penetrance.”  
**Autosomal dominant -** means that the MH patient only requires one abnormal gene in order to manifest symptoms of MH.  
  
**Variable penetrance -** means that a susceptible patient does not necessarily trigger with every exposure to every trigger agent. This is one reason that the patient may have not had an MH crisis in a previous surgery.

**Inheritance pattern for MH is 50%  
**On average, 50% of the offspring will inherit the MH susceptibility if one of the parents  
are MH susceptible.  
  
**Ryanodine receptor (RYR1)  
**RYR1 is a large protein embedded in the wall of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR).  
It serves as the calcium release channel of the SR.  
RYR1 has at least four parts of protein embedded in the wall of the SR Then a long tail of the protein hangs between the space of the SR and the T-Tubule.  
  
The gene for the RYR1is located on chromosome 19.  
  
**Point mutation** in the gene that encode this protein have been found on a large proportion of the MH susceptible patients.  

More than 30 mutations and one deletion are associated with a positive CHCT (contracture test), a clinical MH episode, or both. CHCT is the criterion standard for establishing the diagnosis of MH.

It is presumed that mutation in the gene cause abnormalities of the RYR1 that increase the amount of calcium that is released from the SR into the skeletal muscle cell when the cell is exposed to triggering anesthesia agents.

**Dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) with MH  
**This protein is also embedded in the wall of the T-Tubule of the skeletal muscle cell.  
Several families with MH susceptibility have been found to have mutations in the gene that codes the DHPR protein.

There are other proteins involved in the release of calcium from the SR.

It is possible we have not identified them all of the mutations and all of the proteins that may lead to MH susceptibility.
