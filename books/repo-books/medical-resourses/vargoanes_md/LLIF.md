### LLIF (Lateral Lumbar Interbody Fusion)

Basically a minimally invasive lumbar fusion done in the lateral position with neurophysiology monitoring (usually EMG).

This minimally invasive procedure in done through a retroperitoneal and trans-psoas approach (meaning lateral).

Under a combination of direct palpation and radiographic guidance, a probe is placed down into the spine through the psoas muscle. Because of the presence of the lumbar nervous plexus, this approach is done with EMG monitoring to lesson the risk of nerve injury. After placement of a probe into the disc space, serial dilators are used to enlarge the approach until a retractor can be placed. The rest is standard for a minimally invasive procedure.  
  
These procedures are often backed up with posterior instrumentation in the prone position (360 procedure).

This procedure does not require mobilization of great vessels (like the anterior approach) and so has less risk of increased blood loss.  
  
The LLIF can be used for multiple levels and has now been used in  
minimally invasive treatment for scoliosis.  
  
A C-arm or Medtronic O-arm is used to determine the location of the operative site.  

**Anesthetic**: General / ETT  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Find out ahead of time what the neurologic monitoring tech prefers. You may have to run half MAC or TIVA  
**Propofol Pump:** Only if you are required to run half MAC or TIVA.  
**Ketamine:** Commonly utilized when we are not permitted muscle relaxants. 0.5mg/kg just prior to incision is common.

**Duration**: 1-3 hours  
**EBL:** 50-300mLs  
**IV Access:** 1 18G is acceptable. If this case is followed by a posterior procedure, consider 2 18g catheters incase of large blood loss.  
**Arterial Line:** If this procedure is followed by a posterior fusion, an A-line is common due to the duration and possible blood loss.  
**Antibiotics:** Usually Ancef, unless contraindicated.  
Neuro Monitoring: Usually, surgeon preference.**  
Position**: Lateral  
The ETT should be free without kinking from the pads or pillows used to cushion and separate the arms in the lateral position.

**Possible Complications**

High risk of injury to lumbosacral plexus  
Rectal injury has been reported  
Bleeding  
Dislodgement of the fixation plate and bone graft  
Failed fusion  
Injury to spinal cord or nerve roots
