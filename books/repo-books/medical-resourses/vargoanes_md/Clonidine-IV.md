Clonidine IV    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Clonidine (Catapress, Kapvay)

Clonidine can be administered via: transdermal, IV, neuraxial and PO.  
The major use for clonidine today is for hypertension.  
It is slowly becoming more popular as is dexmedetomidine ( Precedex) in anesthesia.

**Anesthesia Uses**  
Can be used as an adjuvant in anesthesia decreasing the anesthetic requirements  
Provides sedation and anxiolysis  
Decreases analgesic dosage requirements in general and MAC cases.  
Provides favorable cardiovascular effects by reducing catecholamine levels, therefore lowering heart rate and blood pressure during anesthesia (however, it has not been shown to reduce perioperative ischemia)  
Decreases postoperative oxygen consumption  
Given intrathecally, prolongs postoperative analgesia.

**Other possible benefits:**  
Decreased postoperative shivering  
Antiemetic effects  
Decrease in postoperative delirium  
Inhibition of opioid induced muscle rigidity

**Ratio of Alpha 1 vs Alpha 2 Receptors**  
Clonidine is primarily an alpha-2 (α2) agonist used primarily for its antihypertensive effects (α2 to α1 receptor ratio of 200:1). It has been used as an antihypertensive agent since the late sixties. Clonidine is not as receptor specific as its sister drug dexmedetomidine (Precedex).

**Note:**  
Dexmedetomidine (also an α-2 agonist), is more highly selective for the receptor (α-2 to α-1 ratio of 1600:1) as compared to clonidine’s 200:1.

Dexmedetomidine provides the same beneficial effects as clonidine, but with a higher potency and shorter duration of action. This superior ratio over clonidine is why studies show that Precedex is better than clonidine as an IV analgesic. Generic clonidine also has a lower acquisition cost than does the proprietary dexmedetomidine (Precedex).

Alpha-2 receptors are adrenergic receptors that are located primarily on presynaptic nerve terminals. Activation of these receptors inhibits adenylate cyclase activity, which in turn decreases the entry of calcium into the neuronal terminal, which limits norepinephrine release. This leads to an overall decrease in sympathetic outflow, causing peripheral vasodilatation, as well as negative chronotropic effects, thereby causing a reduction in blood pressure.

This decrease in central sympathetic outflow does not affect baroreceptor reflexes, therefore it does not cause orthostatic hypotension. Stimulation of these receptors in the central nervous system has also been shown to have sedative properties.

**Clonidine IV Perioperatively during Anesthesia**  
Some articles state that Clonidine can be used as an adjuvant in anesthesia, reducing requirements for narcotics and propofol. However, another article released in 2016 stated that “Clonidine Does Not Reduce Pain or Opioid Consumption After Noncardiac Surgery” (Turan A, et al. Anesth Analg. 2016 Sep;123(3):749-57. Despite the conflicting literature, many anesthesia providers practice and advocate the use of Clonidine.

**Documented Doses of IV Clonidine**  
  

**Pre-induction**  
3mcg/kg: Administered in the pre-induction period was effective in reducing post-operative pain intensity and fentanyl requirements.

**Induction for long cases**  
**3mcg/kg or 200-300 mcg on induction:** Also 100 mcg when the heart rate and BP start trending up – usually 4 hours into the case.

**Intraoperative:**  
3 mcg/kg administered 20-30 minutes before the end of anesthesia did not delay emergence from anesthesia nor did it have clinically significant sedative or hemodynamic effects.

**Young Males for smooth emergence**  
**40-50 mcg:** 20-30 minutes prior to emergence  
Clonidine, 40-50 mcg, administered to young males (or any patient predicted to be more likely to experience emergence delirium) 30 minutes prior to emergence results in a smooth emergence and calm recovery period.  
**Postoperative Analgesia:**  
**3 mcg/kg bolus:** Provides effective postoperative analgesia and reduced narcotic requirement when administered intravenously.  
**5 mcg/kg:** has produced better analgesia, but the degree of hypotension and sedation was more severe and longer lasting.  
  
**2 mcg/kg:** Known to be less effective in pain relief, but similar side effects of 3 mcg/kg doses.

**Postoperative Shivering**  
Postoperative administration of 3mcg/kg clonidine is an effective treatment for shivering. However, the ability of this drug to stop post anesthetic shivering when administered intraoperatively remains controversial.

**Other uses:**  
**Withdrawal symptoms in addicts**  
Clonidine may be useful in the management of withdrawal symptoms seen in addicts after withdrawal from opiates, alcohol and tobacco. This is because of its ability to suppress sympathetic symptoms from associated with withdrawal

**Migraine prophylaxis and chorea**  
**Menopausal flushing**

**Onset:** may be rapid (few hours)  
**Half-life:** 12 hours  
**Excreted:** Unchanged form by the kidney  
3-4 days are required to steady state concentrations

**Adverse Effects:**  
Dry mouth  
Sedation  
Bradycardia  
Sexual dysfunction  
20% of patients develop a contact dermatitis when given via transdermal  
Withdrawal syndrome and potentially life threatening rebound hypertension  
Prolonged sedation (especially in the elderly)  

**Precautions:**  
Withdrawal causes rebound hypertension  
Caution is needed in cerebrovascular and coronary insufficiency patients.  
Monitoring is needed with CHF and cardiac patients  
Very little amount of clonidine is removed by dialysis; CRF patients need monitoring  
It has been used as an antihypertensive agent since the late sixties.

**Clonidine Withdrawal Syndrome**  
Sudden sensation of clonidine may result with rebound hypertension. This is due to the up-regulation of Alpha-2 receptors during clonidine administration. This is especially true for patients chronically on higher doses of clonidine. It can occur from 8-36 hours since the last dose. Labetalol is the choice of drug for the rebound hypertension.

**Drug Reversal:** Adverse clinical effects of clonidine and dexmedetomidine can be reversed with atipamezole (a specific antagonist).
