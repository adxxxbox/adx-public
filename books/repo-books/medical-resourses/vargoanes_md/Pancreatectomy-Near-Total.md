### Pancreatectomy -Near Total   
(Child’s Procedure)

This procedure is usually performed when the underlying disease has functionally destroyed the pancreas or when lesser procedures have failed to provide adequate pain relief. It consists of removing the entire pancreas except a rim of tissue along the lesser curvature of the duodenum preserving the duodenum makes it unnecessary to reconstruct the bile duct. 

**Pre-op:  
Labs:** CBC, platelet count, electrolytes especially K+, serum glucose, BUN, serum creatinine, blood glucose, PT, PTT, INR, liver function tests, urinalysis, ECG, CXR and Echocardiogram are gathered. Pancreatitis can cause electrolyte disturbances.

**Anesthesia:** General/ETT/RSI  
Epidurals are common to manage post op pain.  
**Duration:** 3-6 hours  
**NG Tube:** Yes, after induction.   
**A-Line:** Yes

**IV Access:** two 18G  
**Central Line:** Sometimes  
**Position:** Supine  
**EBL:** 300-500 mLs.  
**IV Fluids:** Crystalloids over colloids. Pancreatitis patients tend to be hypovolemic.  
**Neosynephrine Drip:** Have available.  
**Electrolytes:** Usually imbalanced due to pancreatitis. A low K+ is common.  
**Blood sugar checks and sliding scale:** Yes. Many patients with Pancreatitis have DM from damaged tissue.  Hypoglycemia is common.  
  
**Possible Complications**  
Endocrine and exocrine insufficiency.  
Wound infection.  
Pancreatic insufficiency.  
Duodenal necrosis.  
Diabetes  
Hemorrhage  

**More Notes**

With the improvement of imaging studies, more incidental pancreatic lesions are discovered and diagnosed. Smaller lesions diagnosed at earlier stages are more amenable to surgical treatment.

**Acute Pancreatitis:** 

A sudden inflammation that occurs over a short period of time. In the majority of cases, gallstones or heavy alcohol use causes acute pancreatitis. Other causes include medications, infections, trauma, metabolic disorders, and surgery.

In up to 30% of people with acute pancreatitis, the cause is unknown. The majority of people with acute pancreatitis recover completely after receiving the appropriate treatment.  
In very severe cases, acute pancreatitis can result in bleeding into the gland, serious tissue damage, infection, and cyst formation. Severe pancreatitis can also create conditions, which can harm other vital organs such as the heart, lungs, and kidneys.

**Chronic Pancreatitis**:

Occurs most commonly after an episode of acute pancreatitis and is the result of ongoing inflammation of the pancreas. In about 45% of people, chronic pancreatitis is caused by prolonged alcohol use. Other causes include gallstones, hereditary disorders of the pancreas, cystic fibrosis, high triglycerides, and certain medicines. Damage to the pancreas from excessive alcohol use may not cause symptoms for many years, but then the person may suddenly develop severe pancreatitis symptoms, including severe pain and loss of pancreatic function, resulting in digestion and blood sugar abnormalities.
