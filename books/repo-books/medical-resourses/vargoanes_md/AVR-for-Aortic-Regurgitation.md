### Aortic Valve Replacement for Aortic Regurgitation

**Pre-op Equipment and IV Access:**  
Same as a CABG but **Fast, Forward and Full**.  
  
**Premedication:**  
Benzodiazepine’s are preferred to prevent anxiety and tachycardia.  
Some line the patient in a pre-op area or wait until they get to the operating room.  
**Catheters**  
2 large peripheral IVs 16 or 18 gauge LRs

A-line  
PA Catheter  
Trauma line or a Cordis  
**PA Line Ports**   
**White** –connect to trifurcate (crows feet)-Neo, Nitro and LR  
**Brown** to CVP  
**Blue** to PA  
Colors may vary at different hospitals.  
Cordis or Trauma line- Blood tubing –connect main blood tubing

Note: Once the aortic cannula is in place for CPB, the Swan-ganz line can be floated into the pulmonary artery.

2 blood sets –one on warmer, one to trauma cord.

  
Make sure all IVs run well BEFORE and AFTER the arms are tucked. I have seen terrible infiltrations with tucked arms.

**Anesthetic Goals (Fast, Forward and Full)  
Pre-Bypass**  
**Induction:** Narcotic based is preferred with an impaired LV.  
**Muscle Relaxant:** Depends on the HR. Pavulon is OK for a slow HR.  
**Inhalation Agent:** Forane is the most popular.  
**Ephedrine:** good to use if a vasopressor is needed.  
  
**Heart Rate:** Fast-keep around 90 bpm. This reduces regurgitations and CO.  
**Bradycardia:** Avoid, because it will increase regurgitation time.  
**Rhythm:** Keep sinus.  
**Preload:** Full, but don’t over-hydrate and cause pulmonary edema.  
**Afterload:** Keep decreased because it promotes forward flow. Avoid arterial constriction and keep the SVR low.  
**Contractility:** Maintain

**Weaning Off Bypass:**  
TEE is essential for coming off pump for fluid and hemodynamic management. It will give you the LV function and a good look at the results of the new valve. Treat the patient according to their individual needs, just like any other heart.

OK to use Neosynephrine and other vasoconstrictors. There is a new aortic valve.  
  
**Other Notes**  
About 80% of aortic valves are replaced with a bioprosthesis.  
Biological valves can be made from pig tissue (porcine), cow tissue pericardial (bovine), or pericardial tissue from other species.
