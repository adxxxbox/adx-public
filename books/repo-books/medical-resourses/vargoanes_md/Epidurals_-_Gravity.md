### Epidurals and Gravity

Position of the patient does affect the spread and height of local anesthetic, but a lot less than that of a spinal.  
  
**Example:** A lateral decubitus position will “concentrate” more local anesthetic to the dependent side; a weaker block will occur in the non-dependent area.  
  
Why we sit the patient up at 90 degrees and give a 10 mL bolus  
  
**Top off for Perineal Pain (re-bolus)  
**_A sitting patient will have more local anesthetic delivered to the lower lumbar and sacral dermatomes._  
  
As labor progresses, the labor pain will spread lower in the perineal area (S2-S4). It is common for the patient to request pain relief.  
Upon arrival, we sit the patient up at 90 degrees and give a 10 mL bolus of your local anesthetic, and it will move caudally to the S2-S4 dermatomes. It is easier to bathe that area while in the sitting position vs supine.  
  
L5-S2 sometimes will have ‘patchy’ anesthesia due to sparing.  
By having the patient “sitting” or in a semi-fowlers position one can concentrate local anesthetic to a lower area.  
Trendelenburg or reverse Trendelenburg may help spread local anesthetic cephalad or alternatively limit the spread.  
  
_Anecdotally, I have seen less sacral sparing in patients who’ve had a CSE to initiate analgesia. I believe there’s a study from Japan that also shows less sacral sparing if there’s been a small-bore dural puncture even without the injection of intrathecal agents._
