### von Willebrand Disease

  
_A deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF)_

von Willebrand disease is presently the most common inherited bleeding disorder.  
vWD could be due to a deficiency (quantitative) or defective (qualitative) function.  
  
**Manifestations of vWD  
**Bruising.  
Epistaxis.  
Mucocutaneous bleeding.  
Menorrhagia in women.  
  
**Diagnosis**  
Based on low levels of vWF antigen and abnormal ristocetin cofactor activity ristocetin (an antibiotic cofactor assay).  
**Review of** **von Willebrand factor**  
Promotes platelet binding to subendothelial tissue at the site of vascular injury.  
It mediates platelet-platelet interactions-promoting further clotting.  
Serves as a carrier protein for factor VIII.  
  
**Prevalence of vWD:**  
Inherited forms of vWD: 1 in 100 to 10,000 of the general population.  
2:1 female-to-male ratio.  
  
**Acquired form** is up to 1% of general population.  
From antibodies developed against vWF, FVIII via lymphomyeloproliferative or immunologic disease states.  
  
**3 Types of** **vWD:** (Type 1 and 3 represent quantitative deficiency with normal vWF)  
  
**Type 1:** Mild bleeding disorder.  
Most common and mildest form.  
Represents 60-80 % of cases.  
Mild to moderate quantitative deficiency of vWF and FVIII.  
  
**Type 2:** A qualitative defect and accounts for 10-30% of cases.  
Desmopressin should NOT be administered, this could aggregate the thrombocytopenia.  
  
**Type 3:** Represents 1-5% of cases  
Most severe form with very low levels of vWF and FVIII.  
Manifest as hemophilia A with hemarthroses.  
Many of these patients die in utero or a few days after birth.  
Desmopressin is NOT beneficial because there are no stores of vWF in the endothelial cells.  
  
**Associated Conditions  
**Aortic stenosis and left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement.  
vWD is associated with gastrointestinal bleeding from arteriovenous malformations.  
  
**Labs:**  
Prolonged bleeding time (in 50% of patients), which is rarely tested.  
Increased aPTT (in 50% of patients)  
Prolonged platelet function analyzer (PFA)-100 values despite normal platelet count  
Deficiency (quantitative) in vWF: FVIII (Type 1)  
Decreased vWF: FVIII activity measured by ristocetin (an antibiotic cofactor assay).  
Decreased VIII:C.  
  
_Before surgery and treatment, all persons suspected of having VWD should have a_ _hematology consult with laboratory- confirmed diagnosis of type and severity of vWD. This recommendation does not preclude treatment that may be indicated for urgent or emergency situations, despite the absence of confirmatory laboratory data._  
  
**Main treatment options:**  
**3 goals:**

-   Increase plasma concentration of vWF by releasing endogenous vWF stores through stimulation of endothelial cells with DDAVP for type 1 vWD.
-   Replace vWF by using human plasma-derived, viral-inactivated concentrates.
-   Employ agents that promote hemostasis and wound healing but do not substantially alter the plasma concentration of vWF.

  
**Minor surgery and Type I vWD**  
Desmopressin 0.3μg/kg given in 50 ml 0.9% saline solution IV over 15 to 30 minutes. Patient should not need replacement therapy.  
**Desmopressin (DDAVP):** effective for type 1 (mild), but is usually of no value to type 2 or 3 vWD. Desmopressin stimulates the release of the stored vWF from the endothelial cells into the plasma, augments platelet aggregation and may increase factor VIII levels.  
  
**Recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF) -** administer preoperatively and during surgery to raise the level of vWF:VIII.  
  
**Cryoprecipitate:** Can be used, but has a risk of viral transmission.  
  
**Other Therapies for vWD  
**_Antifibrinolytics: aminocaproic acid **(Amicar)** or tranexamic acid_ helpstabilize clots that have formed.  
  
_**Tranexamic acid:**_ for mild to moderate VWD. Can be given topically in the oral cavity (“swish and swallow or spit”) every 6 hours. Has been used for prophylaxis in dental surgery, in combination with applied pressure, other topical agents, and suturing of surgical sites.  
  
**Amicar:** 4-5 grams as a loading dose orally or intravenously (1 hour before invasive procedures), and then 1 gram per hour, intravenously or orally, or 4-6 grams every 4-6 hours orally, until bleeding is controlled, or for 5-7 days postoperatively.  
Total daily dose of Amicar is limited to 24 g per 24 hours to minimize potential side effects. Weight-based dosing is required in children and can also be used in adults (50-60 mg/kg).  
  
_**Topical agents**_  
Topical bovine thrombin (Thrombin-JMI)  
Fibrin sealant (Tisseel VH) ®  
Topical collagen sponges  
Coseal ®  
Bioglue ®  
Quickclot ®  
  
**For patients with Acquired vWD -** (produce antibodies against vWF)  
In patients who had a previous inadequate response to DDAVP and VWF/FVIII concentrates, intravenous immunoglobulin G (IGIV; 1 g/kg daily for 2 days) given alone was effective in controlling bleeding and raising VWF:RCo activity for 3 weeks.  
  
**von Willebrand factor/factor VIII (vWF/FVIII) concentrates for patients with von Willebrand disease (vWD) are:**  
Desmopressin (DDAVP)  
Recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF)  
von Willebrand factor/factor VIII (vWF/FVIII) concentrates.  
  
**Genetics**  
The 175-kb gene for vWF is located on short arm of chromosome 12.  
Type 1 follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, with variable expressivity.  
Type 2 varies but primarily follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.  
Type 3 follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.
