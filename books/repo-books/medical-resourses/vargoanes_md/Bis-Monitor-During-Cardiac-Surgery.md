### "BIS" (Bispectral Index) Monitor During Cardiac Surgery

The BIS monitor is one of several technologies used as monitors of cerebral function, using processed EEG to measure the depth of anesthesia. The “index” is graduated in arbitrary units form 1 to 100. Readings under 60 during general anesthesia are thought to indicated sufficient, but not excessive, obtundation.  
  
During hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, the index may show a reading of 0. This indicates an isoelectric EEG, and is of no consequence under hypothermic bypass. However, if the index is seen to increase to the range of 50-60, the perfusionist should be informed of this, and will increase the isoflurane concentration using a vaporizer inline with the bypass pump.
