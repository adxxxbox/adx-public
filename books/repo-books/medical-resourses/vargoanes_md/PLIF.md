## **Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion (PLIF)**

_Basically an interbody fusion from a posterior approach. Also review 'Interbody Fusion'_

First, the spine is approached through a three-inch to six-inch long incision in the midline of the back and the left and right lower back muscles (erector spinae) are stripped off the lamina on both sides and at multiple levels.

After the spine is approached, the lamina is removed (**laminectomy**) which allows visualization of the nerve roots. The facet joints, which are directly over the nerve roots may then be undercut (trimmed) to give the nerve roots more room.

The nerve roots are then retracted to one side and the disc space is cleaned of the disc material.

A cage is inserted into the disc space. The cage helps restore more of the normal spacing between the vertebrae alleviating pressure on the nerve roots. A bone graft is placed in the hollow portion of the cage and along the sides of the spine.

**There are many bone graft options  
**A bone graft may be used from the patient’s own iliac crest, the bone that was removed from the laminectomy or synthetic bone graft options may be used.

The surgeon will insert a series of screws and rods for additional support.

**Anesthetic:** General / ETT

**Muscle Relaxation:** Usually, just check with the surgeon.

**Duration:** 1-2 hours

**EBL:** Minimal

**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable. Make sure the IV site is not an AC site. It may kink when the arms are flexed 90 degrees.

**Antibiotics:** Usually Ancef, unless contraindicated.

**Neuro Monitoring:** Usually not but this will depend on the surgeon.

**Position:** Most are prone: Prone with knees to chest on an Andrews Frame. Before you log roll the patient onto the OR table, make sure you have a foam cradle or Prone View on the patient’s face. Most of us place some type of eye goggles over the patient’s eyes for protection. Many of us use a flex accordion type of anesthesia circuit tubing extender for the ETT. Reconnect the ventilator tubing and monitors. Please re-auscultate lung sounds after turning the patient. Arms pronated out and up < 90 degrees into the flying superman position. Make sure the chest rolls are in proper place and the shoulders are padded.  
Eyes, ears, and nose should be checked to assure that these areas are free from pressure. The ETT should be free without kinking or undue traction, and you should be able to visually see and have access to all your tubing connections.

Before moving the patient to knee-chest in the Andrews frame bed, Inform the OR team when you are ready to hold the patient’s head in the neutral position. When the bed is adjusted, the patient will be moved into a kneeling position. The patient will slide with the knee positioning and the head will want to extend back. This is why you need to maintain cervical neutrality during positioning.

**Possible Complications:  
**Dural tear and cerebrospinal fluid leak: This occurs in 1-2% of these surgeries. It does not change the results of surgery, but post-operatively the patient may be asked to lay recumbent for one to two days to allow the leak to seal.  
Nerve root damage  
Bowel/bladder incontinence  
Bleeding  
Infection

**More Notes**  
**Potential Advantages and Disadvantages of a PLIF**  
Not as much of the disc space can be removed with a posterior approach as compared to an ALIF  
An anterior approach (an **ALIF**, from the front) provides for a much more comprehensive evacuation of the disc space and this leads to increase surface area available for a fusion.  
A larger spinal implant can be inserted from an anterior approach, which provides for superior stabilization.  
PLIF surgery has a higher potential for a solid fusion rates than posterolateral fusion rates because the bone is inserted into the anterior portion (front) of the spine.
