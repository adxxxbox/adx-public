### Midazolam (Versed) and Pregnancy

**The use of midazolam during pregnancy is controversial.**  
For this reason, anesthesia providers commonly avoid administering it to pregnant women.  
  
**Below is some related literature:****  
Human data regarding the teratogenicity of benzodiazepines is conflicting.**  
\- A meta-analysis conducted by Motherisk in 1998 on the use of benzodiazepines in the first trimester of pregnancy showed a significant increase the risk of oral cleft (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.13 to 2.82), but the reliability of these marginally significant results was low because of the heterogeneity of the case-control studies upon which they were based.  
  
In the same meta-analysis, pooled data from cohort studies showed no significant increase in major malformations (OR 0.9; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.35) or oral cleft (OR 1.19; 95% CI 0.34 to 4.15).  
  
In a study following 460 pregnancies exposed to benzodiazepines (98% in the first trimester), there was no significantly increased rate of malformations in the exposed group (3.1%) compared with control subjects (2.6%) (OR 1.2; 95% CI 0.5 to 2.8, _P =_0.51).  
_BMJ._ 1998; 317: 839-843  
  
\- In a 2007 study of benzodiazepine exposure from the Swedish Medical Birth Register that included 1979 infants, the rate of congenital malformations (5.3%) was comparable with that of all births in the registry (4.7%) (n = 873 879).  
\- The use of benzodiazepines near term was related to the “floppy infant syndrome,” especially in higher doses.

**Midazolam and low birth weight:  
**\- Midazolam easily crosses the placental and blood-brain barrier, which can bind to γ-amino butyric acid receptors in the developing fetal central nervous system, potentially affecting fetal growth and development.  
\- An observational study from 2018 and another from 1998 did not detect any significant associations between benzodiazepine exposure with birth weight.  
\- However, these medications have been associated with increased risk of preterm birth, low - Apgar score, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and respiratory distress syndrome in the infant.  
\- Currently, recommendations for the use of benzodiazepines in pregnancy are similar to those for women who are not pregnant, meaning that short-term use can be considered for women with severe anxiety disorders or sleep disturbance after an individual risk-benefit evaluation.  
  
This cohort study, including 82 038 pregnancies, found that benzodiazepine or benzodiazepine-like hypnotic use during pregnancy was associated with a mean decrease in birth weight of 79 grams, a mean reduction in gestational age of 2.1 days, and a 1.41-fold higher risk of preterm birth.

**FDA information with Midazolam per Access Data FDA: (accesses 07/2022)  
**\- An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of benzodiazepines drugs (diazepam and chlordiazepoxide) has been suggested in several studies.  
\- If this drug (referring to midazolam) is used during pregnancy, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus).  
  
**US FDA pregnancy category D:**  
\- There is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans.  
\- There are no data on exposed pregnancies during the first two trimesters, and use during the third trimester could affect brain development.  
\- If midazolam is used during pregnancy, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.  
  
**Definition of category D:**  
\- Drugs that have caused are suspected of having caused or may be expected to cause an increased incidence of human fetal malformations or irreversible damage.  
\- These drugs may also have adverse pharmacological effects.  
\- Accompanying texts should be consulted for further details.
