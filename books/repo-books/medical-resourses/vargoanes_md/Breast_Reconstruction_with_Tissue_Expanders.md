### Breast Reconstruction with Tissue Expanders

It is now common to combine the **mastectomy with breast reconstruction with tissue expanders** in the same case.  
A mastectomy will usually leave insufficient overlying skin to permit creation of a breast mound. The incision cannot be closed over a sized implant.  
  
Using a tissue expander, given time, sufficient tissue can grow to accommodate an implant. Tissue expansion is a technique used to stretch and grow normal tissue that lies adjacent to the defect, mechanically creating redundancy of normal tissue to correct the defect.  
  
Following surgery, the tissue expander is gradually filled with normal saline during routine office visits. The expander may be filled as often as weekly (50-100ml), or may remain unused until radiation or chemotherapy is completed. It may take 2-3 months to inflate the expander fully.  
  
Once the tissue expander is filled with the appropriate volume, it (or they) may then be replaced with breast implants during **second stage tissue expander breast reconstruction.**  
  
**Anesthesia**  
**Pre-op:** Pre-operative sedation should be withheld until the plastic surgeon has marked evaluated the patient and marked the skin, which usually requires that the patient Sometimes the marking of the breasts has been carried out the day before.  
Ensure before sedating and that all consents are complete.  
  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Not necessary for the mastectomy itself, but relaxation is usually required to facilitate the insertion of the tissue expander(s) when going below the pectus.  
**Breast Reconstruction:** Usually  
**Position:** Supine with arms abducted.  
**BP cuff:** Opposite side from the involved axillary node.  
  
**Duration:** 3.5-7 hours total.  
1-2 hours for the mastectomy itself.  
2-4 hours for the breast reconstruction.  
  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable. Place the IV on the opposite side of the involved axillary node. Placement of an IV in the foot is acceptable if bilateral nodes are involved.  
  
**EBL:** 100-200ml.  
**Antibiotics:** Cefazolin (Ancef®), if not contraindicated: Redose as necessary during procedure.  
  
**Emergence:** Apart from cancer, patients are usually in good health.  
Airway and aspiration concerns do not differ from patients with other pathology. Induction, maintenance and emergence are tailored to the patient.  
  
Surgical incision closure awaits completion of the entire procedure. It is not usually necessary to raise the operating table to the sitting position to check for symmetry, thus the arms may be secured in the usual manner for procedures in the supine position.
