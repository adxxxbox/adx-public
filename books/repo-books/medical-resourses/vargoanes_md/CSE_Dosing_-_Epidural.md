### CSE and Dosing the Epidural

  
CSE:(Combined Spinal Epidural)

If the decision to perform the CSE was to have the epidural as a "back-up" anesthetic just in case the C-section went too long, then there may be no need to dose it.  
In these instances, the epidural can be discontinued immediately post-operatively or prior to the patient being transferred out of the Recovery Room.

If the epidural is required to provide surgical anesthesia, then initial dosing can be performed with whichever your drug of choice is 2% Lidocaine, 0.5% Marcaine or 0.5% Ropivacaine can be used. All three at those concentrations provide adequate surgical anesthesia. Also could consider 2-Chloroprocaine 3%. Onset time similar to lidocaine but regresses faster; a potential disadvantage.

I personally dose with Lidocaine 2% for multiple reasons.  
The first is that if I do get a block that is higher than I wanted, it will recede rather quickly. The second is Lidocaine is less toxic if the epidural is intravascular. Again, test dosing a CSE is not always clear, so erring on the side of caution is always best. The third reason is that it sets up rapidly. With that said, utilizing Ropivacaine or Marcaine for dosing is acceptable as well, and will provide for a longer block than Lidocaine.

In general, when bolusing the epidural the volume utilized will be anywhere from 3-5ml as a starting point with any of the above local anesthetics. You can always give more, but once given you can't take it away. Dosing incrementally and assessing your block is a very safe practice.
