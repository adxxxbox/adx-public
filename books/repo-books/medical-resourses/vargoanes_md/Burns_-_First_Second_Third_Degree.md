### Burns - First, Second and Third Degree

_Providing safe and effective anesthesia for burn surgery requires an understanding of the pathophysiological consequences of a severe burn trauma._

**The skin is composed of:**  
Epidermis  
Dermis  
Subcutaneous fat (hypodermis)

**The epidermis:** Consists of an outer layer of dead cells, keratin, and an inner layer of live reproducing cells. It serves as the primary barrier against infection. This layer is mostly avascular.

**The dermis:** Consists of an outer papillary dermal layer and an inner reticular dermis, with the former being a much more cellular and bioactive layer. The dermis plays an important role in fluid balance and heat regulation through control of blood flow to the skin.

Burn injury to the skin disrupts its normal function, potentially leading to variable combinations of infection, pain, dehydration, and hypothermia. This layer is mostly vascular also containing nerve fibers.

**The subcutaneous:** This is below the dermis and if destroyed, grafting is necessary for regeneration.  
If deeper partial-thickness, full-thickness and subdermal burns are left to heal untreated dense scarring occurs which can be both disfiguring and debilitating.

An estimated 70% of burns occur to children up to age 4 and involve primarily scalding etiologies. After age 5, flames appear to be the mechanism of injury.

**First, Second and Third Degree Burns**  

**First-degree burns**  
First-degree wounds are superficial and reddened.  
They do not require surgical intervention.  
Usually treated with topical moisturizers and avoidance of recurrent injury.  
Typically from prolonged sun or flash heat exposure without blisters.

**Second-degree burns**  
Second-degree burns are deeper, causing edema deposition between deeper viable tissue and injured superficial tissues.  
The surface appearance is moist with blisters in various degrees of rupture.  
  
Treatment involves debridement of intact blisters at risk for rupture to remove. Debridement removes the fluid that contains high concentrations of thromboxanes and other pro-inflammatory mediators. Wound beds are covered with topical antimicrobial agents or synthetic wound dressings.  
The deeper elements of the skin remain intact and can regenerate the epithelial layer.

**Third-degree burns**  
Third degree burns are the deepest and appear whitened, black, or dry leathery like skin. They require surgical debridement and skin grafting if larger than two centimeters. Wound packing may be present initially to preserve the wound bed prior to surgical intervention.

**The type of surgical intervention/debridement depends on the depth of the injury.**

**Full thickness burns:** FULL DESTRUCTION; these destroy all of the dermal elements leaving no epidermal cells to regenerate the injured area.

**Partial thickness burns:** These injuries allow epidermal cells to survive in the dermal elements, such as sweat glands or hair follicles to repopulate the injured area. Depending on the depth, partial thickness burns may heal spontaneously with varying degrees of scar. These burns are painful.

In general, partial thickness and second-degree burns are used interchangeably, while full thickness and third degree are synonymous.

The burn patient will present with varying degrees of pain thus requiring assessment and customized treatment. Vigilant aseptic technique and protective precautions are required to prevent local and systemic infection. Strict documentation of any contact or procedure is necessary to protect the communication between the care teams and patient.
