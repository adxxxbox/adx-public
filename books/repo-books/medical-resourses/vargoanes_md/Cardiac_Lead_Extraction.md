## Cardiac Lead Extraction

**Lead Extraction or Replacement for AICD or Pacer**

Similar to a heart setup!

These cases are presently taken much more seriously due to the history of disastrous complications that involve cardiovascular collapse and death.

Severe complications require an immediate sternotomy and bypass. This is why we have all the emergency equipment readily available.

**Complication Rate:** 1-7%

A lead extraction is the removal of one or more leads from inside the heart.

**_Each time the lead is separated from scar tissue, there is a small chance of tearing the surrounding blood vessel or perforating the heart._**

**Most common laceration sites**: Right atrium, SVC or innominate vein.

An incision is made over the existing pacemaker/ICD. This is usually at the same site where the incision was made when the device (pacemaker or ICD) was implanted. A special sheath is placed over the lead to be removed and threaded down into the heart to the tip of the lead. The sheath helps to free the lead from any scar tissue that may be holding it in place. The lead is then removed by gently pulling it out through the sheath. Frequently the doctor will use a sheath attached to a laser (a Laser Sheath) to remove scar tissue holding the lead in place where it is attached to a vein or heart tissue.

**Indications of lead extraction:**  
Dislodgement from the preferred location  
Lead malfunction  
Infection  
Sepsis  
Recall

**What the experts recommend:**  
**If pacemaker dependent:** Transvenous pacer placed pre-op  
**If NOT pacemaker dependent:** R/O becoming dependent (sinus node dysfunction), pacer set to rate of 40 by pacemaker rep.  
Turn off tachycardia detection with pre-op device interrogation or place a magnet to turn of the ICD function.  
Prep the patient for a thoracotomy.  
Large bore IVs, TEE, A-line, Femoral or other central venous line is recommended.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT (these used to be simple MAC cases)

**OGT:** Yes, decompress the stomach for the TEE

**TEE:** Yes, inserted after the patient is asleep.

**Duration:** 30-90 minutes

**EBL:** Minimal to severe hemorrhage

**IV Access:** 2 large bore, some facilities also insert a central line.

**Femoral venous access:** Is also recommended. SVC tears occur much more than IVC tears. It makes more sense to replace blood through the Femoral line with an SVC tear.

**A-line:** Yes

**Additional A-line set up and primed:** Yes, incase you urgently need a PA and CVP. Have cables available.

**Position:** Supine with arms to the side

**Drips:** Epinephrine, Neosynephrine and NTG. They should already be primed and connected.

**Diluted syringes on your table top:** Yes, Epinephrine, Neosynephrine and Ephedrine.

**Other drugs readily available:** Heparin 30,000 units incase of emergency bypass, fentanyl and versed prior to an emergency sternotomy.

**Pacer Pads:** Yes and hooked up.

**Trauma Box in room:** Yes

**Blood tubing primed with saline**: Yes, have extension tubing available so it could reach the femoral venous line.

**Blood available in room:** Yes, if it is a high-risk case.

**Rapid transfuser in the room:** Yes, but do not prime it.

**Possible Complications:  
**Lacerated right atrium  
Lacerated SVC  
Lacerated Innominate vein  
Tamponade  
Air embolus

**What increases complications?  
**Leads > 6 months. Scar tissue has developed.  
Leads < 6 months are lower risk and usually done in the Cath lab  
Female gender  
Use of a laser extraction technique  
Inversely related to practitioner’s experience.  
An experience cardiologist performs >20 lead extractions per year.  

**There are two approaches to lead extraction:**  
**Subclavian Approach**  
The subclavian approach is the most frequently used approach. The leads are extracted through an incision in the upper chest over the subclavian vein.

**Femoral Approach**  
The femoral approach is used when the subclavian approach is not possible. The leads are removed through the femoral vein.

**Reasons for Removal**  
**The lead is not functioning properly.** Sometimes the lead no longer provides a reliable connection between the pacemaker or ICD and the heart. This can be due to damage to the lead, called lead fracture. Large amounts of scar tissue forming at the tip of the lead may also cause the lead to need more energy to function than the pacemaker or ICD is able to deliver.

**A pacemaker infection or ICD infection has developed.**

**The lead is interfering with blood flow to the heart.**

**There may be a manufacturer advisory on your lead.**  
A key challenge in removing a pacemaker or defibrillator lead from the heart is overcoming the fibrous tissue that grows around the lead and adheres to it

A ring of laser energy vaporizes the scar tissue. This process frees the lead from the binding tissue and enables the physician to remove the lead in a controlled fashion.

The overall success rate for lead extraction at Cleveland Clinic is greater than 99.5%. The risk of internal bleeding, a tear in a vein or heart, or death is less than 0.5%.

**When there is a laceration  
**Call for help. You will need more hands.  
Use rapid infuser (or pressure bag) to give crystalloids.  
Increase FiO2 to 100%  
Lower agent or turn it off. Replace agent with Versed, Fentanyl, Scopolamine if needed.  
**Pressors**: Ephedrine or low loses of Epinephrine in the beginning to help minimize hypotension.

**When it becomes more critical  
**Give 1 unit of FFP for every 2 units of PRBCs and stay on top of the Platelet count.  
**If there is a stat sternotomy:  
**Five Fentanyl and Versed prior to going on bypass. Don’t forget to hold ventilation during the sternotomy.  
**If bypass is required:  
**Give Heparin and check an ACT in 3 minutes and redose if the ACT is < 400 secs. Perfusionist or surgeon will tell you.
