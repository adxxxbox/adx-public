### Cardiac Surgery and Infections

**Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)**  
Compromises humoral immunologic defenses.  
Reduce phagocytosis.  
Activates white blood cells.  
All the above impair the ability to neutralize infectious organisms.  
  
**Hypothermia**  
Associated with surgical site infections.  
Increases the degradation of clotting factors and predisposes postoperative bleeding. This is another risk factor for infection.  
  
**Length of Surgical Procedure**  
Risks increases with duration of procedure.  
  
**Indwelling Chest Catheters**  
Chest and all other indwelling catheters serve as external routes for bacterial entry.  
  
**Blood Tranfusion** is associated with immunosuppression.  
  
**Postoperative Mediastinitis (Sternal Incision Infection)**  
An infection carrying significant risk of morbidity and mortality.  
  
**Contributing Factors Seen in Many Cardiac Surgeries**  
Obesity.  
Length of surgery (or duration of cardiopulmonary bypass).  
Smoking.  
Poor hemostasis at the time of closure.  
Diabetes mellitus  
Poor perfusion.
