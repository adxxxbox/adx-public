**Possible Airway Issues  
**Be aware and alert for airway issues before, during and after surgical procedure.

**Anesthetic Induction:** General with Oral Rae ETTInhalation induction with Sevoflurane / O2 and +/- N20 with routine monitoring. Once a suitable depth of anesthesia is reached, obtain IV access and verify that you can mask ventilate the child. Preference is to not give paralytics to intubate - wait until the airway is secured with an ETT.

**Mask Ventilation:** Usually rare for a difficult mask ventilation**.** If encountered, using a nasal or oral airway may help. If the palate has a large defect, oral airways are not particularly helpful. In addition, turning the child lateral or semi-prone may improve the ability to ventilate. The patient should remain spontaneously breathing until intubation is verified.

**Laryngoscopy  
**Cleft patients associated with craniofacial anomalies or retrognathia may be difficult to ventilate or intubate. A difficult view with laryngoscopy is more common than difficulty with mask ventilation. The presence of micrognathia or retrognathia (a small or short jaw), a large alveolar ridge and bilateral clefts are factors that may predict a difficult view. In addition, a large alveolar cleft on the right side may allow the blade to slip into the cleft. A piece of gauze packed into the cleft may help. Have the Glidescope available.

The ideal ETT is the Oral RAE, which does not interfere with the upper lip. The tube should be taped in the middle of the lower lip, which allows for optimal surgical access. In practice, place two strips of tape over the tube, then a tegaderm over the tape, wrapping it around and under the chin. This is very important, as the surgical prep will loosen the tape if used alone. In addition, double check that all connections are tight as the shared airway presents opportunities for occlusion and accidental extubation at almost any stage of the operation.

**MAP:** For palate surgery keep the MAP at age appropriate values. Elevated MAPs may cause excessive bleeding at the surgical site.  
  

**Anesthesia Maintenance:** Controlled ventilation with volatile anesthetic

**Induction:** Standard inhalation or IV is common

**Nitrous Oxide:** Optional

**Duration:** 1.5-2.5 hours

**Position:** Supine, arms to the side or tucked. Bed rotated 90-180 degrees. Some form of  
Trendelenburg is common.

**EBL:** 25-50mLs

**Narcotics:** 1-3mcg/kg fentanyl

**Local anesthetic infiltrated:** Yes, by surgeon

**Regional:** A bilateral infraorbital nerve block. Works great, but rarely performed.  
**Nondepolarizing muscle relaxant:** Usually, after the airway is secured and placement verified. Theoretically, muscle relaxation is not needed, but many surgeons appear to request it.

**Eye Protection:** Tegaderm and eye lubricant applied prior to surgical prep

**IV Access:** One well functioning IV

**A-Line:** Not needed

**Hydration:** 4:2:1 NS or LR  
**(below is just a common reference)  
**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)  
**Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**  
1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**A-line:** Not needed

**Blood Transfusion:** Rare

**Intra-op Labs:** May need to check HCT if unexpected large blood loss. Keep in mind blood loss may be hidden.

**Position:** Supine with head ring and shoulder roll. Cleft palate repair may utilize Trendelenburg.

**Hypothermia Risk:** Low risk if the room is warmed and warming device is used. The operative site is small and the top of the head is draped out. The Bair Hugger may need to be turned down or intermittently turned off to keep the baby from becoming too warm.

**Local Anesthetics:** Infiltrated by surgeon and usually contains epinephrine to reduce blood loss. It is common for surgeons to use 1% lidocaine with epi 1:100,000.

**Special Considerations:** A Dingman mouth retractor is used to expose the palate. Significant tongue, palate and pharyngeal edema may occur due to venous engorgement and Trendelenburg position. It is recommended that the surgeon release the retractor intermittently throughout the procedure to minimize the risk. You will often have to remind them. If swelling that may cause difficulty post op is suspected, a suture may be placed in the tongue. This is so the tongue can be lifted if obstruction occurs. Dexamethasone 0.25mg/kg may be given perioperatively to reduce upper airway edema and problems at extubation.

**Was a throat pack used?  
**If there was, make sure the throat pack is removed prior to emergence.

**Emergence:** If a throat pack was used, verify that it has been removed and inspect the oropharynx for swelling and hemostasis. Reverse muscle relaxant and verify TOF without fade and sustained tetany. These children are extubated with eyes open and wide-awake.

**Possible Tongue Suture Placement (Tongue Stitch)  
**The tongue stitch is sometimes used. The purpose of putting a suture in the end of the tongue is to allow a nurse or doctor to pull out the tongue in case of an airway problem postoperatively. The swelling of the soft palate and tongue may begin to partially obstruct the patient's airway. By pulling the suture (moving the tongue forward), the airway can be opened until other measures can be taken. The suture is usually removed a day or two after surgery.

**Oral Airway:** Oral airways are not to be inserted after the repair of a palate unless there is an airway emergency. If needed, place a small gauze roll in between the teeth but no further to prevent biting of the tube.

**Airway Care**: Routinely suction the ETT. Some surgeons leave a suction catheter inserted through a nare in the oropharynx to suction secretions prior to extubating. The surgeon may place a nasal airway if there are airway difficulties during induction. Supplemental O2 is administered while further assessing the airway.

**Anesthetic or Surgical Complications:  
**Retained throat pack  
Bleeding  
Reduction in pharyngeal tone  
Respiratory depression from narcotics  
Laryngeal and tongue edema

**Airway Obstruction post op:** Common in children with syndromes and especially those with micrognathia. If simple maneuvers such as insertion of a nasal airway tail, re-intubation may be necessary. If a tongue suture was placed, you can pull on the suture it pull the tongue forward.

**Post Op:** It is routine for the patient to go to PACU where they are further assessed to determine their disposition from that point. Often, the palatoplasties patients spend the first night in the PICU.
