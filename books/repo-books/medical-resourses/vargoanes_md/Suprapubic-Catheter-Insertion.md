### Suprapubic Catheter (SBC) Insertion

Suprapubic Cystostomy creates a tunnel from the abdominal wall to the bladder. A catheter can be inserted into the bladder through this tunnel (stoma). 

Sometimes a Foley catheter is inserted through the urethra and the bladder is distended (filled) with sterile saline for easier identification.

**Anesthetic:** General/LMA or ETT  
**Duration:** 15-30 minutes  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 20 G is acceptable  
**Position:** Lithotomy or supine, one or both arms out.

**Indications:**  
Neuropathic bladder  
Outflow obstruction  
Incontinence  
  
**Possible Complications**  
Bleeding  
Bowel perforation  
Catheter malpositioning/expulsion  
Wound infection  
  
**Notes:**  
Intermittent urethral catheterization has long been the standard of bladder care for people with spinal cord injury. Suprapubic catheterization is not the most common method of catheterization but it is easier technique for people with cervical spinal cord injury and limited hand dexterity to do catheterization. 

Studies show that suprapubic catheterization is superior to both chronic indwelling and intermittent urethral catheterization for reducing bladder infections and kidney damage. Although it is associated with a higher incidence of bladder stones, it is not associated with higher incidence of bladder cancer.
