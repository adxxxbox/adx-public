# Zofran

**Zofran (Ondansetron)**  
**Class:** 5HT3 antagonist.  
Carbazalone derivative-structurally related to serotonin and possesses specific 5-HT-3 subtype receptors antagonist properties.  
Despite the Black Box warning, everywhere I work it is still freely administered like it is water.  
**Doses:**  
4mg IV pre-emergence is our standard.  
4mg IV is the standard dose for pre-op to prevent PONV.  
4-8mg IV or 8-16mg PO.  
8mg IV for pruritus associated with neuraxial morphine.  
**Chemotherapy:** 0.15mg/kg up to max of 16mg 30mins before chemo.  
8-10mg BID  
**Severe liver disease:** 8mg max.  
**Peds:** ages 6mo-18 years- 0.15mg/kg up to 16mg dose.  
**MOA:** Blocks serotonin centrally at the chemoreceptor trigger zone and peripherally.  
Despite acting centrally, it is free of neurologic effects.  
**Onset:** Rapid  
**Duration:** 6-12 hours  
**Elimination half-life:** 4 hours  
**Mean terminal half-life:** 3-3.5 hours  
**Peds Mean terminal half-life:** 2.5-3 hours  
**Alternatives**  
If 4mg of Zofran does not work, it is suggested to give either 4mg decadron or 0.625 of Droperidol.  
**Black Box Warning:** The FDA is now recommending ECG monitoring in patients who receive Zofran who have potential “electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or in patients taking other medications that can lead to QT prolongation."  
Zofran should not be used in patients with congenital long QT syndrome because these patients are at particular risk for developing torsades de pointes.  
**Warnings and Precautions:** Hypersensitivity Reactions Congenital QT Prolongation (prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner)  
Masking of Progressive Ileus and gastric distension  
**Hypersensitivity Reactions:**  
Anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.  
**Drug Interaction:**  
Zofran given with APOKYN(apomorphine hydrochloride) can cause severe hypotension or loss of consciousness.  
**Other 5HT-3 Antiemetics not as popular:**  
Dolastron (Anzemet)  
Granistron (Kytril)  
Tropisetron (Novaban)
