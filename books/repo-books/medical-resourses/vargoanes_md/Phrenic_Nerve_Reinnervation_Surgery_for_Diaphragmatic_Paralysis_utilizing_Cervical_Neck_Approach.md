Unilateral phrenic nerve injury often results in lifelong symptomatic hemidiaphragmatic paralysis, and few treatment options currently exist.  
With the advancement of surgical nerve re-innervation, a phrenic nerve can now be re-innervated through a cervical or thoracic approach.  
Despite the novelty of this recent innovation by Dr. Kaufman early results have been promising.  
  
Injury to one phrenic nerve leads to paralysis of the ipsilateral diaphragm.  
If both phrenic nerves are injured, both sides of the diaphragm are affected.  
If the injury is complete, this usually results in ventilator dependency.  
  
**Basic anatomy of the phrenic nerve:**

**![](phrenicNR1.png)**

The phrenic nerve arises from cervical nerve roots C3, C4 and C5.“C3, 4 and 5 keep the diaphragm alive.”  
  
**The right phrenic nerve:** Descends immediately lateral to the superior vena cava.  
**The left phrenic nerve:** Passes in along the aortic arch and main pulmonary artery.  
Both phrenic nerves, which travel through the heart, divide on the surface of the diaphragm.  
They are ramified on the superior and inferior surfaces of the diaphragm.  
  
**Diaphragm and pulmonary mechanics:**Diaphragmatic movement normally accounts for 75% of the change in lung volumes.  
  
**Therefore, this patient population has a reduction in:**  
Inspiratory capacity (IC)  
Total lung capacity (TLC)  
Functional residual capacity (FRC)  
  
Smaller airways are highly dependent on lung volumes.  
The volume at which these airways begin to close in dependent areas of the lung is called closing capacity.  
At lower total lung volumes, patients have an increase in closing capacity.  
At lower lung volumes, alveoli in dependent areas continue to be perfused but are no longer ventilated.  
This results in intrapulmonary shunting of deoxygenated blood.  
These patients have chronic hypoinflation of the lower lung thereby causing atelectasis and V/Q mismatching, reducing oxygen exchange.  
**Note:** Further reduction in FRC occurs when an unanesthetized upright patient is anesthetized. This is the result of the shift of zone 4 (dependent) lung to the posterior portions of the lung from the inferior portions in awake individuals.  
  
**Documented causes of diaphragmatic paralysis:**  
Cervical spinal cord injury or compression  
Carotid-subclavian bypass  
Interscalene block  
Neck or spine trauma  
Cardiovascular open procedures  
Pacemaker insertion  
Neck surgery (thymectomy, thyroidectomy, cervical lymphadenectomy)  
Thoracic outlet operation  
Chronic repetitive trauma such as weightlifting  
Chiropractic manipulation of the neck  
Pulmonary lobectomy  
Viral neuritis  
Idiopathic  
Phrenic nerve compression  
  
**A-fib ablation:** The right phrenic nerve is most commonly affected as it descends in close proximity to sites of ablation in the superior vena cava and both right superior and inferior pulmonary veins.  
  
**Phrenic nerve decompression:**Phrenic nerve decompression involves the removal of musculofascial and vascular sites of adhesions, swelling and scarred tissue from the phrenic nerve.  
These adhesions, swelling and scar tissue can cause nerve impingement and a deficiency in nerve transmission.  
**  
2 types of phrenic nerve grafting:**  
Interposition grafting  
Nerve transfer or neurotization  
**Phrenic nerve interposition grafting:** Sural nerve  
Interposition grafting involves bypassing an abnormal segment or segments within the phrenic nerve using a harvested nerve.  
The harvested nerve is usually the sural nerve which is located near the midline in the lower leg and travels behind the lateral malleolus to innervate the foot.  
The sural nerve supplies sensation to the posterolateral aspect of the calf and the lateral aspect of the foot.  
Therefore, motor function is unaffected by the absence of the sural nerve.  
**  
Phrenic nerve transfer or neurotization:**  
This involves finding a functional nerve in the neck or chest (i.e., spinal accessory or nerve to rectus) and transferring it to the phrenic nerve, using the sural to connect the two.  
The sural nerve supplies sensation to the posterolateral aspect of the calf and the lateral aspect of the foot.  
Therefore, motor function is unaffected.  
**  
Phrenic nerve regeneration after phrenic nerve regeneration:**Nerve regeneration occurs at a rate of 1mm per day.  
It takes about 10 months for patients to benefit symptomatically from nerve grafting.  
The patient may experience immediate improvement from the decompressed portion of the nerve.  
**  
Surgical goals:**  
Reverse the symptoms (partially or completely) associated with unilateral or bilateral paralysis  
Reduce infection related to atelectasis  
Reduce sleep-disordered breathing  
Reduce the exacerbation of underlying pulmonary disease  
Reduce fatigue  
Reduce depression  
Improve quality of life  
**  
Preop:**  
A general preoperative assessment is performed followed by **a very detailed pulmonary evaluation.**  
Is the patient dyspneic?  
**Note:** The extent of shortness of breath usually coincides with the severity of damage and how difficult it will be to extubate postoperatively.  
Assess home oxygen use and what concentration or flowrate is required.  
Assess onset and history of dyspnea.  
  
**Does the patient require CPAP or BiPAP?**Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)  
bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP)  
CPAP or BiPAP are noninvasive treatment modalities using positive airway pressure supplementation for treatment of diaphragmatic paralysis.  
If the patient requires CPAP or BiPAP at home, they will need a set-up in the recovery room postoperatively.  
  
History of COPD and types of medications?  
Assess for OSA.  
Assess exercise reserve.  
Can the patient tolerate being supine?  
Does the patient require the head of bed up and at what angle?  
Positioning limitations are important to know during emergence and extubation.  
Does the patient have severe left sided diaphragmatic paralysis?  
If so, the elevated diaphragm can alter the relative position of the stomach and the elevated diaphragm, causing GERD.  
The gastric contents positioned more cephalad in a supine patient.  
Does the patient have symptomatic preoperative acid reflux?  
If so, RSI and aspiration prophylaxis are indicated.  
  
**Room set-up:**Additional IV tubing and supplies to insert a second IV post intubation.Underbody warming blanket.  
**Pre-op sedation:** Minimal or none.  
Explain to the patient that sedation is minimized to ensure the ability of the patient to perform a “sniff test.”  
The sniff test allows evaluation of diaphragmatic function while the patient inhales deeply through the nose under fluoroscopy.  
This test is completed before induction.  
  
**Upon entering the room and during the sniff test:** _(chest fluoroscopy)_An X-Ray technician and equipment should be present when the patient arrives in the room.  
General monitors are applied, keeping in mind that bed will be rotated after induction.  
The blood pressure cuff should be positioned on the arm opposite the surgical side.  
  
**Sniff test:**  
Depending on the severity of the patient’s diaphragmatic paralysis, oxygen is supplied by a simple oxygen facemask prior to the sniff test, to increase the patient's oxygen reserve.  
The patient may be sitting straight or at various angles as directed by the surgeon.  
A metal instrument, usually a Kelly clamp, is placed on the patient's chest wall parallel to and at the level of the diaphragm.  
Under chest fluoroscopy, the patient is asked to take a deep breath in (inspire) and deep breath out (expire).  
The visualized paralyzed diaphragm is usually elevated and displays diminished mobility.  
The level of the diaphragm is marked for accurate EMG testing throughout the procedure.  
  
**Midazolam** may be administered after the sniff test.  
**Anesthesia:** General anesthesia/ETT.  
**Induction:** Preoxygenate the patient with 100% O2 for 10 minutes via well-sealed facemask prior to intubation to compensate for a lack of pulmonary reserve, which reduces safe apnea time.  
This is based on the severity of the patient’s diaphragmatic paralysis.  
Elevate the HOB to the patient’s comfort since many have orthopnea.  
Because EMG testing is used, the duration of muscle relaxation is limited.  
  
Consider 1 MAC of inhalational agent or less supplemented by a continuous remifentanil infusion.Avoid spontaneous respirations intraoperatively.  
**Intubation:** Single lumen ETT taped to the side of the face opposite the surgical site.  
  
**Muscle relaxation:** Yes, for about 30 minutes prior to EMG monitoring  
Duration: 2-3 hours  
**Position:** Supine, arms to the side and bed rotated 90 degrees with the opposite side away from the anesthesia machine.  
A shoulder roll is placed to facilitate surgical site exposure.  
Hyperextension of the neck is avoided.  
When the operative site is the cervical neck and sural nerve, the patient's arm is tucked on the same side of cervical neck incision.  
Padding is placed in the patient's hand with the thumb facing up.  
Ensure that the I.V. lines are hanging outside of the padding and tucked sheet.  
The patient’s nonoperative arm is secured with padded wrist straps and padded arm boards.  
  
**IV access:** A second IV started after induction.  
**IV fluids:** Standard. Small surgical incision, and surgical fluid loss is minimal.  
**Decadron:** Usually 10 mg  
**Antiemetics:** Yes  
**Maintenance:** 1 MAC or less of volatile agent with a remifentanil infusion, titrated to effect.  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**Ventilation:** Avoid nitrous oxide.  
  
**Surgical incision:**  
Surgical incision site depends upon the location of the damaged portion of the phrenic nerve.  
If the damage is in the cervical spinal roots, a lateral neck incision will be performed.  
If the damaged portion is on the diaphragm or thorax, a laparoscopic V.A.T.S or open thoracotomy approach is employed.  
**  
Surgical incision for the cervical approach:**  
Since the phrenic nerve originates from cervical spinal roots C3, C4 and C5, the surgeon makes the initial incision a few centimeters above the clavicle on the side of the affected diaphragm.  
If the injury to the phrenic nerve is bilateral, the surgeon will operate on the side with the most damage and return at a later date to operate on the contralateral side.  
If nerve grafting is required, the sural nerve is retrieved from the patient’s lower midcalf.  
The surgeon usually offers the patient the choice between their left or right calf.  
Patients usually opt for their left, non-driving leg.  
  
**Intraoperative EMG:**EMG testing measures muscle response and electrical activity in response to nerve stimulation of the muscle.  
Ground electrodes are placed by the electrodiagnostic technician.  
These ground electrodes are then connected to a sterile electrical probe.  
The surgeon uses the sterile electrical probe on the cervical portion of the phrenic nerve to differentiate healthy electrical conducting nerves from damaged non-conducting nerves.  
  
Patients are evaluated with an intraoperative E.M.G. both before and after neurolysis.  
If comparative intraoperative testing fails to show improvement after decompression, nerve grafting and/or nerve transfer is then performed.  
**Discontinue remifentanil** about 10-15 minutes prior to extubation.  
Consider MDI with albuterol (Proventil®) down the ETT with emergence.**Emergence** can be challenging since the patient’s ventilation is already compromised.  
Elevate the head of bed to enhance diaphragmatic flattening.  
Avoid sudden manipulation of the neck as it may potentially cause damage to the intricate cervical surgery and/or cause a hematoma at the surgical site.  
The head of bed is turned back to the anesthesia machine.  
Apply CPAP with spontaneous respirations.  
  
**Pulmonary recruitment with emergence:** Yes  
**Awake extubation:** Yes  
Consider transporting the patient with a simple face mask or nonrebreathing mask.  
**Note:** If the patient required CPAP or BiPAP for their phrenic nerve injury prior to surgery, it should be readily available and already set-up in the recovery room prior to arrival.
