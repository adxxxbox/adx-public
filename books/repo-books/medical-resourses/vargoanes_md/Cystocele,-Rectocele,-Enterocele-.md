### Cystocele, Rectocele and Enterocele

**Cystocele**: Protrusion of the bladder into the vagina.  
Anterior Colporrhaphy repairs it.

**Rectocele:** Protrusion of the rectum into the vagina.  
Posterior Colporrhaphy repairs it.

**Enterocele** (small bowel prolapse): When the small bowel presses against and moves the upper wall of the vagina.  An enterocele is a hernia of the lining of the peritoneal cavity with or without abdominal viscera. The enterocele can occur posteriorly with or without inversion of the vagina. The enterocele should be distinguished from a rectocele, because the procedure for surgical correction is different.  

**Rectoceles** and **Enteroceles** will develop if the lower pelvic muscles become damaged by labor, childbirth, a previous pelvic surgery or when the muscles are weakened by aging. A rectocele or an enterocele can be congenital, though this is rare.

An accurate diagnosis should be made as to whether the patient has an enterocele alone or an enterocele associated with a rectocele.
