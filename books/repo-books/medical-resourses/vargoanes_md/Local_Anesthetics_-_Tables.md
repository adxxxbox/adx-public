### Local Anesthetic Tables Cheat Sheets

_The larger the dose, the higher the block._  
_The higher the concentration, the denser the motor block._

| Local  
Anesthetic | Conc. | Onset | Sensory Block | Motor Block | Plain Solution | With Epi |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Short Acting** |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| 2-chloroprocaine | 3% | 10-15 minutes | Dense | Dense | 60 minutes | 90-120 minutes |
| **Intermediate  
Acting** |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Lidocaine | 1.50% | Intermediate 10-20 minutes | Dense | Mild to moderate | 30-60 minutes | 60-120 minutes |
| Lidocaine | 2% | Same | Dense | Dense | 45-60 minutes | 45-80 minutes |
| **Long Acting** |   |   |   |  |   |   |
| Bupivacaine  
(Epidural Analgesia) | < 0.25% (0.125% is common infusion) | Slow | Dense | Mild to moderate | 2.5+ hours | N/A for epidurals |
| Bupivacaine (spinal-C-sec) | 0.5 -0.75% | Same | Dense | Mild to dense | 2.5-4 hours | 3-4 hours |
| Ropivacaine (epidural) | 0.1-0.2% (0.15 or 0.2%) is more common. | Slow | Analgesic | Mild to moderate | 2-3.5 hours | N/A |
| Ropivacaine (epidural) | 0.50% | Same | Dense | Dense | 2-4 hours | N/A |
| Ropivacaine (epidural) | 0.75-1% | Same | Dense | Dense | 3.5-4.5 hours | N/A |

| Agent | Class | Potency | Onset | Duration | Uses / Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Procaine (Novocaine) | Ester | Low Potency | Rapid | 45-60 minutes | •Local infiltration, peripheral nerve block.  
•Differential subarachnoid block.  
•Minimal systemic toxicity.  
•Not used in OB. |
| Cocaine | Ester | Low potency | Rapid | 10-55 minutes | •Topical anesthesia only - due to systemic toxicity and addictive potential.  
•Provides vasoconstriction; may cause severe increase in heart rate and blood pressure.  
•Used primarily for nasal intubations and nasopharyngeal surgery.  
•Sensitizes myocardium to catecholamines. |
| Chloroprocaine (Nesacaine) | Ester | Intermediate potency | Rapid | 30-45 minutes | •In OB: 3% Chloroprocaine may be used for urgent C-section per epidural.  
•Local infiltration, peripheral nerve block, epidural anesthesia.  
•Little systemic toxicity.  
•Bisulfite preservatives can cause neurotoxicity if accidentally injected into subarachnoid space; use only PF solution for epidural injection to avoid spinal neuropathy.  
•Blocks more sensory than motor nerves. |
| Tetracaine (Pontocaine) | Ester | High potency | Slow | 60-180 minutes | •Topical anesthesia, subarachnoid block.  
•Profound motor and sensory blockade.  
•Potential for systemic toxicity in large doses.  
•Potentiated by cimetidine. |
| Lidocaine (Xylocaine) | Amide | Intermediate potency | Rapid | 30-60 minutes plain solution or 120 minutes with epinephrine | •In OB, used for epidural test dose and urgent C-sections per epidural.  
•Topical anesthesia, local infiltration, intravenous regional, peripheral nerve block, epidural block, subarachnoid block.  
•Blocks motor and sensory nerves equally.  
•Useful in anesthetizing the trachea for intubation. |
| Prilocaine (Citanest) | Amide | Intermediate potency | Rapid | 60-120 minutes | •Local infiltration, intravenous regional, peripheral nerve block, epidural block Less vasodilation than lidocaine.  
•Least toxic of amides, large doses may cause methemoglobinemia; not widely used for this reason. |
| Etidocaine (Duranest) | Amide | High potency | Rapid | 300-600 minutes or 5-10 hours | •Local infiltration, peripheral nerve block, epidural block.  
•Not used in obstetrics due to profound motor blockade. |
| Mepivacaine (Carbocaine) | Amide | Intermediate potency | Moderate | 90-180 minutes or 1.5-3 hours | •Local infiltration, peripheral nerve block, epidural block.  
•Does not cause vasodilation.  
•In high doses can depress respiratory and cardiac function.  
•Not used in obstetrics due to prolonged effect on fetus.  
•Local infiltration, intravenous regional, peripheral nerve block, epidural block, subarachnoid block.  
•Excessive dose or accidental IV administration may cause local anesthetic toxicity may needed treated with intra lipids.  
•Produces good sensory blockade in dilute solutions with minimal motor blockade. |
| Bupivacaine (Marcaine, Sensorcaine) | Amide | High potency | Moderate | 300-600 minutes or 5-10 hours | •Local infiltration, intravenous regional, peripheral nerve block, epidural block, subarachnoid block.  
•Excessive dose or accidental IV administration may cause local anesthetic toxicity may needed treated with intra lipids.  
•Produces good sensory blockade in dilute solutions with minimal motor blockade. |
| Ropivacaine (Naropin) | Amide | High potency | Moderate | Up to 720 minutes or 12 hours | •Peripheral nerve block, epidural block (safe for obstetrics), all others undetermined.  
•Less cardiotoxic than bupivacaine.  
•Produces less motor blockade than bupivacaine. |
