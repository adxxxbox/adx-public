### Pallidotomy/Thalamotomy For Parkinson’s Disease

A Pallidotomy and a Thalamotomy are surgical procedures often used to treat patients suffering from Parkinson's disease.

Thalamotomy and pallidotomy surgeries are rarely done today because the newer treatment –“Deep Brain Stimulation” is much safer with less serious complications. If the surgeon is off by even a fraction of an inch, the surgery may not be effective and have severe complications.

**Pallidotomy**  
A tiny electrode probe is placed in the globus pallidus. It is then heated to 80 degrees Celsius for 60 seconds to destroy a small area of brain cells. This approach is used to treat the dyskinesia. A brain lab stereotactic frame is applied for precise insertion. The patient is to remain AWAKE for communication.

**Thalamotomy**  
A surgical procedure used to reduce tremors by destroying part of the thalamus.

**Anesthetic:** very light MAC, the patient needs to be awake to communicate with the surgeon.  
**Position:** Supine or low fowler’s position.  
**Meds:** Don’t give any medications that may affect Parkinson’s.  
**Drugs to Avoid:**  
**Propofol:** it has an anti-parkinsonian effect.  
**Atropine:** Robinul is preferred. Atropine crosses the BBB.  
**Droperidol and Reglan:** Avoid. Zofran is acceptable. Avoid ketamine.

Toradol and IV Tylenol drip (Ofirmev) are preferred to decrease the need of narcotics. Ask the surgeon before you give anything.

The burr hole is the most stimulating part of the surgery. The surgeon localizes the site.

**Possible Complications**  
Paralysis  
Loss of vision  
Loss of speech

**Damage to:**  
Globus Pallidus Subthalamic pathways  
Thalamus Optic pathways
