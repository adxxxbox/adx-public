### Burn and Liver Damage

**Liver damage may result from:**

**Hypovolemia**: related to hypoperfusion during the initial stages of burn injury; significant decreases in SVR may mimic sepsis.

**Sepsis**

**Drug toxicity**: Dosing challenges may present related to burn phase.  
Drugs relying on hepatic blood flow may have decreased elimination and prolonged durations during early Burn Shock phase; decreased dosing may be warranted.

**Blood transfusion:** stored PRBCs do not have physiologic equivalent oxygen carrying capacity and often promote a left shift in oxy-Hb dissociation curve.  
Drugs relying on hepatic blood flow may have decreased elimination and prolonged durations during early Burn Shock phase; decreased dosing may be warranted.

Later post resuscitation phases often accompany increased hepatic blood flow, altered protein production, and drug binding that may warrant dose increases.
