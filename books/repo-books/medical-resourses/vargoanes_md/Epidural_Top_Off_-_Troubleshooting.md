### Epidural Top Off - Troubleshooting

**Always Troubleshoot  
Ask the patient where she is having pain.**  
If she has rectal pressure, you may request for her OB to examine her first.  
If she only has supra pubic pain, she may have bladder distention. Ensure that her Foley is not kinked.  
  
**Check the infusion pump** , tubing, and bag of bupivacaine solution to rule out malfunctions, leaks, or empty bags.**  
  
Check sensory level bilaterally**  
You may have a one-sided block.  
Ask your patient to lie on the side that is still painful and then bolus the patient.  
If this does not work, the epidural catheter may be pulled back 1-2cm, depending on how much catheter was inserted, and a bolus administered.The epidural may need to be replaced if adequate sensory block is not achieved with the above trouble shooting maneuvers.  
  
Evaluate whether the patient has a motor block  
Feel whether both legs are equally warm  
Check the labor anesthetic record for previous dose, time and result of last “top off” and for whether the epidural placement was difficult.  
  
Determine, by consulting with the nurse, the position of the fetus, the station, and the latest cervical exam. This may influence the drug and dose you choose to administer.
