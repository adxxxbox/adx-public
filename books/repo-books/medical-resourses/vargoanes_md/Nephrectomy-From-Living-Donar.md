### Nephrectomy From Living Donor (LDN)  
(Hand-Assisted Laparoscopy)

Two adjacent ORs are prepared for the procedures; surgery on the donor and surgery on the recipient proceed simultaneously.

Now days for living donors, they are minimal invasive-laparoscopy (hand assisted).  

Besides the small incisions for laparoscopy, a vertical incision near the umbilicus through which a hand is inserted to hold and then remove the kidney  
Once the kidney is separated from everything around it,  
the adrenal gland is removed. Then the urethra, renal vein and artery (in this specific order) are meticulously dissected. Maximum length of the ureter and renal vein and artery are achieved.

**Read important hemodynamics notes under “Other Notes” below.**  
**Anesthetic**: General/ETT  
**Position:** Lateral nephrectomy position by flexing the table to gain maximum access between the iliac crest and the ribs. The body is cushioned and secured with adhesive tape. Be aware that there is less blood flow to the upper kidney (donor) in this position. Don’t forget an axillary roll and a beanbag.  
**Bair Hugger:** Yes, upper body.  
**Antibiotics:** 1-2 grams of Ancef after induction.  
**IV Access:** 2 IVs, 20g or 18g. Central line with CVP is rarely used anymore for donors.  
**Pre-Operative Fluid loading:** Overnight- 3ml/IBW kg/hr for eleven hours plus colloids before the pneumoperitoneum.  
Some protocols say NO to colloids.  
**Intra operative Crystalloids:** 13 ml/ IBW-kg/hr or a minimum of 12 – 15 cc/kg/hr (Anticipate 3-5 liters crystalloid for entire case).  
After the kidney is removed, you can slow your IV rate.

Adjust rate as needed to maintain UOP. Depends on protocol.  
**OGT**: Yes, they will want the stomach deflated.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Yes, Zemuron or Norcuron is OK.  
**Foley Catheter:** Yes  
**UO:** Check it Q 15 minutes and inform surgeon. It should be at least 2ml/minute or 2ml/kg/hr until the ureter is transected. Some protocols are 100mL/hr. After the ureter transection, the UO should fall to l ml/minute from the remaining kidney.  
**Minnitol:** 12.5 grams prior to clamping the renal artery to stimulate diuresis. Surgeon will tell you when to give it.  
**Lasix:** 10-40mg 10 minutes prior to clamping the renal artery to stimulate diuresis. Surgeon will tell you when to give it.

**Ventilation**: Mean PIP < 25cnH2O is suggested.  
**Narcotic Drip:** Sufentanil is suggested to keep a continuous therapeutic level but many still don’t use one.  
Dopamine (0.5-3mcg/kg/min) infusion: Sometimes

**Colloids**: 1 Liter is suggested. Some say “NO.”  
BIS: around 47.  
Epidural analgesia: Yes, TEA with Marcaine-Sufentanil is popular.  
Duration: 3-4 hours  
  
**Other Notes**  
Altered hemodynamics during the donor nephrectomy can delay proper renal function after the kidney is transplanted in the recipient.  
We try our best NOT to compromise the donor’s renal blood flow and BB.  
The causes of the altered hemodynamic parameters reduce renal blood flow and UO during LDN, and the delayed renal function after LDN are probably multifactorial.  
So there are many protocols out there to prevent or decrease the triggering of the hemodynamic compensatory mechanisms that may result in a decrease in renal perfusion.

When vessel dissection is complete, the surgeon may use papaverine around renal artery. 

We all know that the average laparoscopic required pneumoperitoneum can reduce RBF and BP. GFR and UO reduction can be up to 50%, despite well-maintained arterial blood pressure. Onset of tubular damage usually occurs within 25 minutes of ischemia.  
This is why the surgeon reduces their inflation pressure and we also try our best to keep the hemodynamics stable.

**Why We Pre-hydrate**:  
With the onset of anesthesia, any drop in MAP with the presence of low circulating blood volume can drastically decrease renal blood flow. A series of compensatory mechanisms can lead to the release of renin, angiotensin, aldosterone, and vasopressin.  
This is even before the negative affects of the pneumoperitoneum.

Choice of anesthetics may influence RBF, not only directly, but also by producing changes in cardiovascular function and in neuroendocrine activity.  
Propofol anesthesia has been shown to attenuate surgical stress-induced adverse immune neuroendocrine hormone release better than other types of anesthesia.
