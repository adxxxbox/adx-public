Shunts, Right to Left (cyanotic)   

### Shunts, Right to Left (cyanotic)

In a right-to-left shunt, the dexoygenated blood from the right side of the heart (pulmonary circulation) flows into the left side and bypasses the lungs. This oxygen-deficient blood mixes with the oxygen-rich blood on the left side (systemic circulation) and is then pumped out to the rest of the body. There is now a reduction in oxygen levels in the systemic circulation leading to hypoxemia and possibly cyanosis. This is also referred to **cyanotic congenital heart disease**.

In most of the defects with right-left shunts the physiologic shunts present before birth remain functional because no reversal of pressure happens following birth.

As you know, simple shunts are NOT associated with obstructed outflow lesions and are much easier to understand than the complex shunts.  
  
The pressure gradient between the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) on the left side and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) on the right side.  
Normally the SVR is greater than the PVR, so blood which travels the way of least resistance will flow from the left (systemic) to the right (pulmonary) side.

**Simple Shunts**  
Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)  
Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)  
Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)  
  
When the PVR becomes greater than the SVR; unoxygenated right-sided blood will shunt to and mix with the left systemic oxygenated blood causing lower SaO2 and possible cyanosis.

**SVR Goals with a simple right to left shunt**  
Increase or maintain SVR  
Avoid decreases in SVR  
  
**PVR Goals with a simple right to left shunt  
**Decrease or maintain PVR  
Avoid increases in PVR

**There are four main factors that decrease PVR (increase pulmonary blood flow) and may decrease right-to left shunting:**  
Increased oxygen  
Decreased CO2  
Increased pH (alkalosis)  
Decreased sympathetic stimulation (avoid pain and cold).

Kids dramatically respond to increased oxygen and lowered CO2.  
  
Anesthesia depth is always a consideration when the SaO2 drops.  
  
Narcotics will decrease sympathetic outflow and thus decreasing PVR.

Shunt orifice and outflow resistance are the most the most important determinants of shunting, particular with ventricular and great vessel shunts.

Ventricular compliance is more important with atrial shunts

**Types of Right-to-Left Heart Shunts**  
There are several congenital heart defects that may result in a right-to-left shunt.  
  
**The most common are:**  
Tetralogy of Fallot  
Persistent Truncus Arteriosus  
Tricuspid atresia  
Transposition of the great arteries  
Total anomalous pulmonary venous return

**Anesthesia and Hemodynamic Goals to decrease Left-to-Right simple shunting**

Maintain or prevent decreases in SVR and Increases in PVR  
Increase FiO2 (avoid hypoxia)  
Prevent acidosis, promote alkalosis  
Decreased sympathetic stimulation (avoid pain and cold)  
Avoidance of air bubbles in IV lines to prevent paradoxical emboliRemain vigilant for the way that oxygen and CO2 effects pulmonary vessel tone.  
  
Manipulate ventilation in order to balance the pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances if needed with right to left shunts.  
Increased FIO2 lowers PVR (which is good)  
Hypoxia increases PVR (not good)  
Hypercapnea increases PVR (not good)  
Hypocapnea decreases PVR (which is good)  
  
PVR decreases with increased concentrations of inhaled O2 up to 50%.

**Induction of right-to-left shunts notes  
**You want to avoid drops in SVR and MAP with induction because it will increase the right-to-left shunting. Ketamine is preferred over propofol.Propofol will also further reduce the pulmonary blood flow in cyanotic kids.  
  
**Induction with a right-to-left shunt  
Inhalation:** In general a right-to-left shunt will slow the rate of inhalational induction of anesthesia.  
**IV Induction:** A rapid accelerated IV induction (blood bypasses the lungs and goes straight to brain).  
  
**More Notes**  
Different types of left-to-right shunts may reverse to form right-to-left shunts. The shunt may reverse based on the hemodynamics (primarily SVR and PVR).  
  
**IV Induction with Propofol vs Ketamine with Shunting  
**One study showed that children with CHD induced with propofol, more patients had a decrease of MAP > 20% than those who received ketamine.  
  
During induction with propofol, the SaO2 tends to drop more than 5% as opposed to NO drop in SaO2 with ketamine.  
Increased right-to-left shunting can occur from a decrease in SVR with administering propofol during induction.

If the PVR is high, propofol may exacerbate pulmonary vasoconstriction and increase ventricular afterload.  
  
Ketamine has been shown to increase heart rate with no change in the Qp/Qs. Ketamine relaxes bronchial smooth muscle.  
  
Etomidate provides excellent hemodynamic stability in teenagers and adults with CHD.

Succinylcholine is usually avoided in kids with CHD because of the possibility of severe bradycardia.

Literature states that pancuronium is the muscle relaxant of choice because it tends to temporarily increase HR and BP through vagolysis, but this response may be absent in kids with CHD.

Sevoflurane, Isoflurane, fentanyl and versed do not appear to affect the Qp/Qs ratio as long as the patients are mechanically ventilated at normal capnea with 100% O2.
