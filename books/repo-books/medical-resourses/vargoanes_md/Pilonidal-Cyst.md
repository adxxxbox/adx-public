Pilonidal Cyst     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Pilonidal Cyst

A painful cyst that develops along the coccyx near the cleft of the buttocks, approximately 4 cm-5 cm from the anus. These cysts are believed to be caused by the penetration of loose hairs into the skin through dilated hair follicles into the subcutaneous tissues. In response to this ingrown hair, a local inflammatory reaction causes a cystic structure to form around the hair and the other skin debris. These cysts usually contain hair and skin debris. Some patients may be asymptomatic, whereas others may develop an infection of the cyst with associated pain and inflammation. Recurrence of pilonidal cysts is common and is estimated to occur in approximately 40%-50% of individuals.

The surgeon makes an incision over the infected area to open the abscess cavity. The pus is then drained, and any accumulated hair and debris are removed. The wound is cleaned with saline solution, packed with gauze, and covered with a bandage.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT or MAC  
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes  
**EBL:** 10-20ccs  
**Position:** Prone, with a rare Jack-Knife addition.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable

Always ask the surgeon about limiting IV fluids.  
Difficulty urinating after any anorectal surgery may occur due to spasm of the urinary sphincter resulting from pain due to the surgery. A full bladder can also contribute to rectal pain via pressure. This would **NOT** be good with an overhydrated patient.  
Many surgeons want you to limit hydration. I have seen some protocols for the patients to have only a 500cc IV bag with micro drip tubing.
