# Ketamine(Ketalar) Pharmacology and Notes

Ketamine was invented by Dr. Craig Newlands in 1962 out of Wayne State University in search of a safer anesthetic alternative to PCP Classified as a type of disassociative drug.  
PCP (Phenocyclidine) Derivative-1/10 as potent but still effective NMDA (N-Methyl-D-Aspartate) Receptor Antagonist anesthetic agent. In 1965-Chosen to be most promising from 200 PCP derivatives tested in animals  
It alters the actions of the neurotransmitter glutamate throughout the brain.  
Glutamate is involved in perception of pain, responses to the environment, and memory Ketamine distorts sounds and sensations and makes users feel detached from reality.  
Some ketamine experiences involve a terrifying feeling of almost complete sensory detachment that is likened to a near-death experience sometimes referred to as "the K-hole."

**Causes:**

Analgesia  
Intoxiating and dissociative (between Thalamocortical and Limbic Systems)  
Hallucinatory  
Psychomimetic effects  
Nystagmic gaze

* * *

Sedation  
Amnesia  
Emergence Dilerium-up to 30% visual auditory confusional illusions. Giving versed prior to Ketamine decreases emergence dilerium.

**Receptors it acts upon**:  
Opioid  
Muscurinic  
Monoaminogeric  
Voltage sensitive Ca channels

**Respiratory**\-no to little depression. Induces bronchodilation. Only general anesthetic that keeps you breathing.  
Increases Salivation-musurinic. So give some robinul.

**ICP and CMRO2-**Increases -Do not give with Cranis  
**Cardiac**\-Mimics SNS-increases BP,CO,PAP,cardiac workload, myocardio O2 consumption. Do not give with CAD  
**Intraocular pressure (IOP)**\-Increases-do not give for open eyeball cases
