### First vs Second Generation LMAs (supraglottic airways)

**First-generation LMA:**  
\- Have extremely high esophageal seal pressures (> 50–60 cm H 2 O).\- Do not have an extra port or specific design aimed at reducing the risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents.  
  
**Second-generation LMA:  
**\- Contain a gastric channel (port) to place an orogastric tube to prevent aspiration.  
\- Have reduced risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents.  
\- Better able to act as conduits for tracheal tube placement  
\- Have allowed more dependable positive-pressure ventilation  
\- Made of disposable materials  
\- Have integrated bite blocks  
\- Made of disposable materials  
\- Have reinforced tips that prevent folding  
\- Incorporate improved cuff designs to help create a better cuff seal with higher ventilation pressures  
\- Are more rigid in their design to prevent rotation and to facilitate easier insertion  
  
**Some examples of second-generation LMAs:**  
\- ProSeal (PLMA)  
\- LMA Supreme (Teleflex)  
\- i-gel (Intersurgical)  
\- AuraGain (Ambu)  
\- King LTS-D (Ambu)  
  
**Contraindications to Second-Generation LMAs**  
\- Excessive air leak through the gastric channel  
\- Esophageal varices  
\- Esophageal trauma  
\- Upper gastrointestinal bleed  
\- History of upper gastrointestinal surgery  
\- Coagulopathy
