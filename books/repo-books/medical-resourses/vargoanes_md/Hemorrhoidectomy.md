Hemorrhoidectomy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Hemorrhoidectomy

The excision and ligation of dilated veins in the anal region.

**Anesthetic:** MAC or General (usually General/ETT)

Some surgeons give a great local injection. Find out the surgeon’s preference.

**MAC:** Remember they are Jack-Knife, so be careful how much Propofol you administer prior to the local injection. You don’t want to lose the airway. Make certain the patient is comfortable and their airway positioning is optimal. You may consider Ketamine.  
One CRNA (that does many of these procedures) uses 2mg of Versed, 250-500mcgs of Alfenta depending on the patient’s size, airway status and risk of reflux. The Alfenta should be administered just prior to the local injection. Then this CRNA starts working in 25-50mg increments of Propofol. Be prepared to perform a good jaw thrust when/if the patient gets briefly apneic. Have suction at hand; and tell the OR staff to leave the stretcher in the room if possible. If severe airway difficulties develop, you may need to immediately roll the patient back to supine.

You can consider 0.1-0.2 mg/kg of Ketamine. Many CRNAs reserve Ketamine and Versed only for morbidly obese OSA patients. Consider administering both Pepcid and Reglan in the holding area. 

**Position:** Usually Jack-Knife  
**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**IV Access:** 20 G is acceptable

**Hydration:** Many surgeons will demand you to limit IV fluids because a full bladder can push against the rectum or cause post-op swelling of the tissues. So keep them dry. Difficulty urinating after any anorectal surgery may occur due to spasm of the urinary sphincter resulting from pain due to the surgery. A full bladder can also contribute to rectal pain via pressure. This would NOT be good with an overhydrated patient. I have seen some protocols for the patients to have only a 500cc IV bag with micro drip tubing.
