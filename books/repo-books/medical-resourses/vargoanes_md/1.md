### CABG Equipment Step by Step

**Room Set:** Up  
  
**Blood available:** Check with circulator  
  
**Fluid warmer:** Have primed.  
  
**2 blood sets:** One on warmer, one to trauma cord.  
Can have blood tubing connected to the patient's IV in pre-op or have connected to warmer in the OR.  
  
**5-7 IV drip pumps****Check Forane** vaporizer level  
  
**8.0 OETT,** airways, suction, tape, etc  
  
**Prime cardiac output injectate, ensuring that no bubbles are present.**  
  
**Calibrate Cardiac Output Machine:** Enter patient's weight and height.  
Calibrate SVO2 monitor for Swan.  
  
If you don't calibrate pre-insertion of Swan, obtain a venous blood gas post insertion.  
  
**Triple Transducers:** Prime and zero  
  
**Internal Defibrillator:** Check it and review its operation. Know how to connect the cable, adjust energy output to 20 joules.  
  
**NGT/OGT (if used) Unless TEE is planned, one can be inserted later.**  
  
**Cerebral Function Monitor:** Depends on institution.  
  
**Extra Syringes:** For drawing labs, ACTs etc.  
  
**TEE Machine** on anesthesia side: near head of bed (if needed).
