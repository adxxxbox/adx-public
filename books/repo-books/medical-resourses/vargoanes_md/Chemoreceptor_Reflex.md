### Chemoreceptor Reflex

The primary function of the **chemoreceptor reflex** is to regulate respiratory activity by maintaining arterial blood PO 2 , PCO 2 , and pH within appropriate physiological ranges.  
  
**It consist of central and peripheral chemoreceptors  
****Central chemoreceptors**  (medullary neurons)  
**Peripheral chemoreceptors**  ( **carotid and aortic bodies** )  
They are called bodies because they make up a body of tissue.  
The peripheral chemoreceptor cells that make up the body of tissue are called “glomus cells.”  
  
**Chemoreceptors also affects cardiovascular function either by:**  
**Directly:** By interacting with medullary vasomotor centers.  
**Indirect:** Via altered pulmonary stretch receptor activity.  
  
Inhalation agents inhibit the chemoreceptor reflex in a dose dependent manner.Hypercapnia may delay onset of spontaneous respirations with emergence.table.tableizer-table { font-size: 12px; border: 1px solid #CCC; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; } .tableizer-table td { padding: 4px; margin: 3px; border: 1px solid #CCC; } .tableizer-table th { background-color: #104E8B; color: #FFF; font-weight: bold; }

| **Stimuli** | PaO2 < 50 or acidosis (from ↑Hydrogen ion concentration) |
| --- | --- |
| **Receptor** | Carotid sinus (bifurcation of internal carotids)  
Aortic arch (not at same location as baroreceptors) |
| **Afferent nerves** | Glossopharyngeal and Vagus nerve  
Carotid receptors: Sinus nerve of Hering, which is a branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX cranial nerve).  
Aortic arch receptors: Innervated by the aortic nerve, which then combines with the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) traveling to the medulla. |
| **Medulla oblongata** | Chemosensitive area of the medulla |
| **Efferent nerves** | Vagus nerve (cranial nerve X)  
↑ Parasympathetic-vagus → ↑ Ach release → Heart SA node → Bradycardia  
↑ Sympathetic system |
| **Response** | ↑ Minute ventilation and ↑BP |
