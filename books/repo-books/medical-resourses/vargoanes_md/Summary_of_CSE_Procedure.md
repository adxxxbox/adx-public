### Summary of CSE Procedure

_By Lisa Stiel Moreno, CRNA_

Prior to the block, obtain 2 ml of fentanyl and a 30 ml vial of 0.25% bupivacaine (or another local anesthetic of your choice).  
  
Open and place the fentanyl and bupivacaine on the worktable prior to placing the epidural.  
  
After location of the epidural space, place a 5” 27-gauge pencil point Whitacre spinal needle (located in your epidural cart).  
  
Insert the spinal needle through the epidural needle until you feel the “pop” of the spinal needle through the dura mater. Warn the patient that they may experience a paresthesia at this point.  
If you do not get CSF return, you may be in the epidural space or the epidural needle may be in a lateral part of the epidural space.  
  
**After you visualize CSF, inject the following medications, mixed in a 3 ml syringe through the spinal needle:**  
10mcg of fentanyl and  
1 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine  
  
**NOTE:** In a recent study (Anesthesiology 2001;94:593) the optimal dose of intrathecal fentanyl was  
between 5-15mcg.  
The reduced dose of fentanyl decreased pruritus almost in half (73% to 40%).  
The duration of the intrathecal dose was approximately 60 minutes.  
  
Remove the spinal needle and inject the remainder of the PF normal saline through the epidural needle and thread the epidural catheter. You should not have to bolus the epidural catheter with a local anesthetic at this time because the onset of your spinal dose only takes minutes.  
  
Begin the epidural PCEA maintenance infusion immediately.
