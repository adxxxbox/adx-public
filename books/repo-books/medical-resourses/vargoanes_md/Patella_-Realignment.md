### Patella Dislocation or Realignment of Patella

This occurs when the kneecap is pulled out of the trochlear groove on the end of the

femur. The kneecap is always pulled to the outside of the groove. Once a patella

dislocation occurs, it is much more likely to occur again in the future.

Most of the dislocations occur laterally (outside).

Following a patellar dislocation, the first step must be to relocate the patella into the

trochlear groove. I once saw a young 14 year old male with a patellar dislocation brought

to surgery. His patella was dislocated and was almost vertical. His kneecap was

protruding like a shark fin under the skin. As we moved him to the bed, the OR assistant

let the knee flex just slightly and suddenly the patella flattened back into position. Weird!

But the surgeon wisely placed the patient in a non-flexion disposable brace and we were

done.

Associated problems normally occur with patellar dislocations, the most obvious of

which is tearing of the ligaments that stabilize the kneecap itself.

**3 Common Surgical Methods of Repair:**

Lateral Release (See Lateral Release Procedure)

Medical Imbrication/Reefing.

MPFL Repair/Reconstruction.

Despite which above method is utilized, the anesthesia plan is usually the same.

**Anesthesia:** General/LMA or ETT.

**Position:** Supine, arms out

**Regional:** Optional; a Spinal or Femoral nerve Block.

**Duration:** 1-2 hours

**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable

**EBL:** Minimal

**Possible Complications:**

Hemarthrosis

Redislocation

Thrombophlebitis

Compartment syndrome.

Infection

**Causes of Dislocations:**

Patellar dislocations can occur either in contact or non-contact situations. An athlete can

dislocate his/her patella when the foot is planted and a rapid change of direction or

twisting occurs. Usually a pre-existing ligamentous laxity is required to allow a

dislocation to occur in this manner. Direct blows to a knee can cause dislocations as well.

The force of these is obviously much greater and usually causes more severe damage

especially to restraining ligaments.
