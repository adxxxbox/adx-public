Supraclavicular Nerve Block Continuous Infusion    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Supraclavicular Nerve Block Continuous Infusion

**Note:** A continuous infusion is fairly rare with this block because it is difficult for the catheter to cover all targeted areas.**Goal:** Place the catheter within the vicinity of the trunks and divisions of the brachial plexus adjacent to the subclavian artery.  
**Technique:** Similar to interscalene catheter placement  
Continuous infusion for these blocks is not very common.  
Continuous infusion for interscalene blocks is much more common.  
**The procedure consists of three phases:**  
\- Needle placement  
\- Catheter advancement  
\- Securing the catheter  
  
**Catheter insertion:**  
\- A 17 to 19-gauge Tuohy needle is placed, rather than a block needle.  
\- The needle is typically inserted lateral-to-medial direction so that the tip is just posterior to the brachial plexus sheath.  
\- The needle is then advanced to pierce the sheath.  
\- A 20 or 19-gauge single- or multi-orifice catheter is threaded far enough past the needle tip to allow the catheter perforations to bathe the desired nerve(s).  
\- The catheter should be tightly fixed to the skin with tape or sutures away from the planned area of the surgical incision.  
  
**Catheter-over-needle kits:**  
\- Alternatively, catheter-over-needle kits are available for perineural catheter placement using ultrasound guidance, nerve stimulation, or both.  
\- The technique for placement is the same, but the catheter slides over the end of the needle, similar to intravenous (IV) catheter placement.  
\- A leak around the catheter may be less with catheter-over-needle equipment.  
  
**Postoperative infusion settings:**  
**For ambulatory patients:** Continuous infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine is common.  
**For inpatients:** 0.1% bupivacaine is administered.  
Other anesthesia providers may prefer 0.2% ropivacaine.  
  
**The On-Q Ball (pump):  
**The On-Q is a ball between 300-500ml of 0.2% ropivacaine.  
**Setting:** Usually 5ml per hour with a 5 ml bolus once an hour.  
There are many opinions and variations on dosing.
