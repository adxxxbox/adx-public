Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)   

### Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)

  
_By John Martin Kramer, CRNA, Novant Health, Charlotte, NC_

**Short summary of the surgical procedure:**  
EGD is a common procedure in pediatrics and usually performed under a general anesthetic or heavy sedation. For pediatrics, this procedure is usually performed as a diagnostic study for abdominal pain that has not responded to other treatments.

**Indications of the procedure:**  
GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease) unresponsive to therapy  
EoE (Eosinophilic Esophagitis)  
Irritable Bowel Disease associated with Crohn’s  
Diagnosis of Celiac Disease (gold standard)  

**Short summary describing the anesthesia:**  
Patients will normally arrive to the endoscopy suite where the anesthesia provider will perform a preoperative exam and go over all the risks associated with a general anesthetic.  
  
**_These cases have fast turnovers and you will not have time to seek out equipment and prepare between cases._**

**Room Set up  
**You will need to arrive early and set up accordingly for age and number of procedures you have for the day.  
**Ex.** If you have 6 kids, you will need 6 warm IV bags and tubing primed ahead of time (assuming they are all inhalation induction). You will also need enough airway equipment.  
Appropriate sized ETTs for each case (just incase you need to intubate).  
Appropriate sized oral airways.  
Appropriate sized masks for your patient.  
  
**Bedside available Meds:** Robinul, Atropine, Ephedrine and Succinylcholine.

**Propofol syringes:** **United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter 797** regulations prohibit us to pre-draw up several propofol syringes for a few cases to save time. You may prelabel syringes to save time drawing up Propofol immediately prior to each case.  
  
Lilley et al. showed that adding lidocaine to propofol emulsion increased the lipid droplet size and caused an oil droplet to form in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The addition of 10 mg of lidocaine to 90 mg of propofol also caused a time-dependent reduction of propofol concentration in the emulsion as propofol separated out to form an oily layer **(15)**. Despite these changes, Lilley et al. **(11)** suggested that the changes in droplet size with freshly prepared mixtures using up to 20 mg of lidocaine to 200 mg of propofol were unlikely to have clinically significant effects. **1**

**Pre-op and what to prepare. What you need to find out?**  
Need to prepare normal emergency drugs for a pediatric case.  
Succinylcholine and atropine available as well as appropriate endotracheal tubes. Premedicate the child (ages 0-10) depending on maturity level. Otherwise an IV should be started on the child.  
**For kids > or = 5 years:** Ask about loose teeth. Kids begin losing anterior teeth at that age. Warn the parents about the bite block used.

**Pre-op medication -** To decrease the anxiety for both the parent and the child during separation.

**Children </= 10 years:** Midazolam 0.5-0.7 mg/kg orally is most common

After 10-20 minutes the patient is transported to the procedure room and of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) -required monitors are placed.  
**Children >/= 10 years:** A pre-op IV is usually started by an RN and we usually administer midazolam 0.5-2 mg IV just prior to transporting your patient back to the procedure room.

**Anesthesia:** General/ETCO2 NC or GETA  
**Regional-Caudal:** N/A  
**Airway issues:** Normal pediatric airway issues, large tongue, big head.

**Induction:** Mask induction for younger children (<10) and IV for older children(>10)  
**Propofol:** manual infusion after the IV is secured and you can turn off your inhalation agent (usually Sevoflurane).  
**  
Propofol Doses:**  
125-300 mcg/kg/min if an infusion pump or  
1 mg/kg loading dose followed by 0.5 mg/kg as needed- if choosing to use boluses.  
  

**After the IV is inserted and secured:  
**Turn off the inhalation agent  
Remove the mask  
quickly place on an ETCO2-monitoring nasal cannula administering oxygen at 2-3 L/min  
Start administering propofol  
  
**Bite Block:** The GI nurse or tech will usually hand you one to place in the mouth to prevent damage to the teeth or the endoscope.  
  
_The patient is more prone to a laryngospasm if they are too light or if the Gastroenterologist doesn’t watch the tip of the endoscope as it passes by the vocal cords and down the upper esophagus._

**Nitrous: +/-** induction**Muscle Relaxation:** N/A**Position** : Head of bed up 25-30%; most patients are left lateral, some are supine.  
**Duration:** 5-15 minutes, can be quick  
**EBL:** minimal

**IV Access:** 24-22 gauge depending on age of child  
  

**Emergence:** Emergence is usually smooth as the patient has had very little anesthetic gas to contribute to emergence delirium. Additionally, the patient has been breathing spontaneously; however, since this is considered a general anesthetic you always need to be aware of phase two and the possibility of laryngospasm from saliva or lubrication jelly that may have fallen off the endoscope.**  
  
Possible Complications:**

Damage to teeth or gums  
Sore throat if intubation was required  
Aspiration  
Esophageal perforation  
Laryngospasm  
Hypoxia-most common complication  
Bleeding

**Highest Complications Seen With:  
**Youngest age group  
Highest ASA class  
Female more than males  
  
Aspiration is always a possible complication when giving a general anesthetic especially since the airway is not secured and propofol decreases muscle tone in the lower esophageal sphincter.  

**Hydration: 4:2:1** **(below is just a common reference)**  
Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**More Notes**  
Anatomical Differences  
The newborn esophagus-only 8 to 10 cm in length and 5 mm in diameter and the soft posterior wall of the trachea is easily compressed during upper GI endoscopy.  
Also, the antrum in small children is acutely angulated, requiring a greater degree of tip deflection to view the pylorus.  
The proximal duodenum is acutely angulated as well, obscuring views of the posteromedial wall.  
The diameter of the empty duodenum, jejunum, and ileum in newborns measure 10 to 15 mm.  
The newborn colonic diameter is approximately 10 mm except for the cecum, which is approximately 17 mm.
