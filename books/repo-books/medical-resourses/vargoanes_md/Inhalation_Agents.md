# Inhalation Agents

| Agent | MAC Neonate | MAC Infant | MAC Child | MAC Adult |
|-------|-------------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Nitrous Oxide | | | | 105% |
| Isoflurane (Forane) | 1.4% | 1.87% | 1.6% | 1.2% |
| Desflurane (Suprane) | 9% | 10.0% | 8.1% | 6.0% |
| Sevoflurane (Ultane) | 3.3% | 3.0% | 2.5% | 2.0% |

## Notes

- 1.25-1.3 MAC is required for no movement to surgical stimulus in 95% patients.
- 1.5% MAC is required to block adrenergic response.
- 0.5% MAC is required for amnesia (amnestic MAC)

**Blood:Gas Coefficient** - the higher means the more will dissolve in blood elsewhere leaving less available to the selected organ (brain), meaning slower onset/offset. Desflurane and Nitrous Oxide's low Blood:Gas Coefficient means faster onset/offset.

**Desflurane and Nitrous Oxide's low Blood:Gas Coefficient** means faster onset/offset (the less soluble, the more quick on/off).
