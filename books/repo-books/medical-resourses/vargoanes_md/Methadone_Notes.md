### Methadone

_**Drug Class:**_ Narcotic analgesic**  
  
Methadone has an FDA black box warning  
**_Cases of QT interval prolongation and serious arrhythmia (torsades de points) have been observed during treatment with methadone. Most cases involve large, multiple daily doses of methadone, although cases have been reported in patients receiving doses commonly used for maintenance treatment of opioid addiction. While the effect is dose dependent, sudden cardiac death has been seen in doses as low as 20 mg/day.  
__The risk is also increased in persons who are CYP2B6 slow metabolizers._  
  
**History of Methadone  
**German scientists synthesized methadone during World War II because of a shortage of morphine. It produces many of the same effects as morphine and heroin but it is not chemically similar. Introduced into the United States in 1947, its primary use today is for the treatment of narcotic addiction.  
  
Methadone is a very long-acting synthetic narcotic with a slow elimination, used to help people who have become physically dependent on opioids. These opioids can be illegal (heroin or prescription pain killers). They may also be legally prescribed opioids to which the patient has become tolerant and addicted, with difficulty withdrawing from them. Sometimes methadone is prescribed for chronic pain.  
  
Methadone inhibits ascending pain pathways, alters perception of and response to pain (dissociative effect), has antitussive properties, and produces generalized CNS depression.  
  
Most literature describes PO and not IV administration.  
  
Intraoperative methadone administration resulted in reduced postoperative morphine requirements, improved pain scores, and enhanced patient-perceived quality of pain management.  
  
**Drugs that increase methadone concentrations:  
**SSRIs (particularly fluoxetine and fluvoxamine)  
Fluconazole, ketoconazole  
Acute alcohol ingestion  
  
**Drugs that decrease methadone concentrations:  
**Carbamazepine  
Phenytoin  
Rifampin  
Chronic alcohol ingestion  
Nevirapine  
Risperidone  
Ritonavir  
Methadone increases concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and zidovudine.  
  
**Receptors affected by methadone  
**Primarily mu, but also kappa and delta.  
Suggested to be an antagonist of NMDA, which effect can help prevent central sensitization and reduce opioid tolerance.  
Respiratory depression also occurs due to complete blockade of respiratory centers to PaCO2. (S)-Methadone lacks significant respiratory depressant action is less likely to lead to addiciton.  
  
**Antidote for respiratory depression:** naloxone (Narcan).  
  
**Greatest advantages of methadone**  
Effective in stopping extreme flu-like symptoms of opioid physical withdrawal.  
Proper dosing decreases the euphoric effect of opioids used by patients for their euphoric effects.  
Therapeutic levels decrease withdrawal symptoms. Patients with therapeutic levels feel “normal.”  
  
**Other advantages of methadone  
**Has a rapid onset and slow elimination, which results in prolonged effect and diminished need for postoperative analgesics.  
Inexpensive.  
Legal.  
Lower pain intensity compared with morphine.  
Has the longest half-life of opioids  
Not many side effects.  
  
**Disadvantages of methadone  
**Despite normal dosing, inter-patient variability may alter therapeutic ranges and lead to toxicity.  
More active and more toxic than morphine.  
Certain drugs can affect levels which increase the risk of toxicity.  
Has a black box warning at higher doses.  
Exceeding the therapeutic range may lead to toxicity and even death.  
Though very rare, methadone has caused QT prolongation and torsades.  
Sudden death has been reported in doses as low as 20 mg/day.  
A pretreatment EKG is recommended  
Most anesthesia providers know little about methadone used perioperatively.  
Perioperative management of methadone with opioid-dependent patients is not discussed in any major anesthesiology textbook.  
Recreationally, methadone is abused for its sedative and analgesic effects.  
  
Methadone is available as the racemic (dl) mixture, as levomethadone (R)- or _l_ –methadone which is 8-50 times more potent than dexamethadone, the (S)- or _d_ \-isomer. While the analgesic effect of methadone is due primarily to the _R_ \-isomer, about 80% of the cardiac effects are ascribable to the _S_ \-isomer.  
  
_**Route of Administration:**_  
Oral ingestion  
Intravenous  
Intramuscular.  
Subcutaneous injection  
  
Equivalency tables comparing other narcotics to calculate a dose of methadone is unreliable due to variables that alter therapeutic levels. Variables that alter therapeutic ranges may lead to toxicity.  
  
**Variables that increase methadone levels  
**Cipro  
Valium  
Ethanol (acute use)  
Diflucan  
Urinary alkalinizers  
  
**Variables that decrease methadone levels  
**Amprenavir  
Efavirenz  
Nevirapine  
Phenobarbital  
Phenytoin (Dilantin)  
Rifadin  
Urinary acidifiers  
Carbamazepine (Tegretol)  
Ethanol (chronic use)  
  
**Perioperative indications for methadone  
**For those patients who are involved in methadone-maintenance programs.  
For opioid-dependent patients or patients with a moderate tolerance to opioids.  
For prevention of postoperative pain.  
  
For cancer and neuropathic pain. It is an alternative to morphine, growing rapidly in first-line use. Nevertheless, it remains relatively infrequently used in the operating room and postoperatively.  
  
It also has a depressant action on the cough center and may be given to control intractable cough associated with terminal lung cancer.  
  
**Patients on methadone  
**Patients should continue their PO methadone dose before and on the day of the surgery to avoid unnecessary fluctuations of the drug level.  
The abrupt discontinuation of methadone before surgery is unjustifiable.  
  
**EKG  
**Methadone may be associated with QT prolongation leading to AV node dysfunction.  
It is critical that an EKG be conducted prior to and during methadone dose adjustments.  
If QTc > 500, methadone should be tapered and discontinued.  
If QTc is 450 - 500, close monitoring of the ECG is required.  
  
**Mechanisms of action  
**Has multiple actions quantitatively similar to those of morphine, the most prominent of which involve the central nervous system and organs composed of smooth muscle.  
Primarily an opioid _agonist_ at the mu opioid receptor. Mu receptors produce the most profound analgesia. To a lesser extent, it is also an agonist to the kappa and delta opioid receptors.  
  
It is suggested that it has antagonistic activity at the NMDA receptors which effect can help prevent central sensitization and reduce opioid tolerance.  
  
**Onset:** mildly rapid, but does not peak rapidly.  
Peaks in 10-20 minutes following parenteral administration and 30-60 minutes after oral administration.  
Methadone’s half-time for effect-site equilibration (T 1/2 k e0 ) is only 4 minutes (similar to fentanyl), so the onset is considerably faster than morphine.  
  
**IV PCA:** Methadone’s quick onset, coupled with its long elimination half-life, could be advantageous in IV-PCA format.  
The long elimination half-life can be useful in patients with chronic, intractable pain, such as those with cancer. However, the marked variability in elimination half-life makes routine use of IV PCA challenging. Dosage should be titrated carefully and determined on an individual basis.  
  
**Duration:** Following single oral doses effects may last 6-8 hours, increasing to 22-48 hours in cases of chronic administration.  
Repeated oral or parenteral doses can result in substantial accumulation, with subsequent doses lasting much longer than the initial dose.  
After larger doses, the duration increases dramatically due to the drug’s extremely slow clearance via CYP2B6 (terminal half-life ~ 35 hours).  
Single bolus doses of 20-30 mg can produce detectable analgesic effects for 24-36 hours.  
  
**Potency:** A single dose of methadone is equipotent with morphine.  
Due to methadone’s accumulation, analgesic potency increases over time.  
After a few days, the equivalency ratio changes to 1:3.  
After a few weeks, this increases further to 1:6 and even 1:12.  
  
**Absorption:** Well absorbed following oral administration.  
The bioavailability of methadone ranges between 36 and 100%.  
  
**Volume of Distribution:** has a large distribution of 1.0 to 8.0 L/kg and is highly lipophilic.  
  
**Protein binding:** In plasma, methadone is predominantly bound to α1-acid glycoprotein (85% to 90%).  
  
**Elimination Half-life:** 8-59 hours (average = 22hrs). Its half-life is longer than its duration of analgesic action (4-8 hours). Half-life is prolonged with alkaline pH, decreased during pregnancy and is shorter in children than adults.  
It has a longer, but inconsistent, elimination half-life than do other opioids, which could increase risk for toxicity secondary to accumulation.  
  
**Note:** Published descriptions of elimination half-life vary drastically.  
  
**Bi-exponential half-life  
**After initial bolus, methadone plasma levels decline in an exponential manner with a half-life of 2-3 hours during the initial phase and 15-60 hours during the terminal phase.  
  
This contributes to the increased probability of toxicity with long term usage.  
  
**Metabolism:** Hepatic.  
CYP2B6 is responsible for methadone metabolism and clearance.  
Polymorphisms in CYP2B6 exist that increase or decrease the rate of methadone metabolism. African Americans are more likely to be slow metabolizers than other ethnic groups.  
Caution is warranted in patients with liver disease.  
  
**Two inactive metabolites:  
**2-ethylidene-1.5-dimethyl-3.3diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP).  
2-ethyl-5-methyl-3,3-diphenyl-1-pyrroline (EMDP), through N-demethylation and cyclization.  
  
**Excretion:** Mediated by extensive biotransformation, followed by renal and fecal excretion. Mainly in the urine. <10% as unchanged drug and increased with urine pH <6.  
Caution with renal patients.  
  
**Methadone and cross tolerance  
**The combined mu-agonist and NMDA-antagonist actions of methadone result in an incomplete tolerance. Thus, the dosage conversion ratios between methadone and morphine and other mu opioids are different for opioid-naïve versus opioid tolerant patients.  
  
**Accumulated toxicity with methadone**  
Methadone has a very long elimination half-life, even though its duration of action as an analgesic is markedly shorter. Therefore, life-threatening complications may not result from any one single dose but rather from the accumulation of previous doses.  
  
**If a patient shows signs of over sedation or respiratory depression with methadone**  
Hold multiple doses because of its prolonged duration of action.
