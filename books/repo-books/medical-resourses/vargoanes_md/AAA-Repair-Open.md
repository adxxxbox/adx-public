### AAA (Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm); Open

This open procedure is now becoming rarer, thanks to endovascular stent placements. Open procedures can be hectic with a large blood loss.  
  
An open AAA is repairing the AAA through a midline abdominal incision. Thankfully, most of these Open AAA procedures have been replaced by the much easier Endovascular AAA repair. Most AAAs are asymptomatic and discovered from a thorough routine exam. Elective surgery is recommended for any aneurysm >5 cm in diameter. AAA can be repaired by straight tube graft or aorta to bilateral iliac graft replacement.  
**Symptoms:** Usually asymptomatic, but they may have lumbar back or abdominal pain.  
**Imaging:** CT scan, MRI, basic x-ray or angiography.  
CT angiography is becoming the method of choice because it tells you size and location (infra or supra-renal) and the status of major branches (inferior mesenteric artery).  
  
**Causes:** Atherosclerosis, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, dissection, or congenital vasculitis, or infections including syphilis.  
  
**Tips for Open AAA Procedure:**Keep the patient warm.  
Keep HR slow (avoid tachycardia).  
Avoid anemia (keep HCT >25-30).  
Prevent HTN (avoid challenging the aneurysm).  
  
  
**Procedure:** Basically the surgeon will cross clamp below and above the aneurysm, open the aorta, remove the diseased area and replace it with a graft. Clamps are removed. EBL can be large. See notes below about hemodynamic changes with clamping and unclamping.  
**Pre Op:**  
Do they have a thorough Cardiac workup? If they don’t have one, treat them like a CAD patient. Many of these patients have co-existing CAD.

**Placing Lines and Monitoring:** **Goal is to sedate and avoid hypertension**  
Place the largest bore peripheral IVs possible (14G if possible). Right IJ line is good. Have a TEE in room instead of a swan. You can use one more introducer without a swan. A TEE provides constant evaluation of LV filling status.

**Fluid Warmers:**1-2 ready to go.  
**Rapid Transfuser or pressure bags:** yes, ready.  
**Blood Transfusion Tubing:** 2, run through with NSS. Everything ready to go.  
**Cell Saver:** Yes  
**Warming Blanket:** 2, below and upper body.  
  
**Induction/Intubation:****  
Methods to avoid hypertension with direct laryngoscopy:**  
Consider adding Esmolol with induction to blunt a spike in BP.  
Consider Remifentanil, start at 0.5-1 mcg/kg/min 8 minutes prior to intubating.  
Consider high narcotic induction dose like doing a heart case.  
Consider using a Glide Scope. It is less stimulating.  
  
****Anesthetic:**** **General/ETT  
**Thoracic Epidural:**** Yes. Dose it or start an infusion before the incision.  
**RSI-** Many treat these patients like a full stomach.  
**NG Tube:** Yes.  
**Duration:** 3-5 hours.  
**Position:** Supine, with arms tucked.  
**EBL:** 500-1,000 mLs  
**Common Intubation Dose:**  
Fentanyl: 10-20mLs  
Versed: 5mg  
When large doses of narcotics are used, be prepared for rigidity. Narcotics will decrease the need for volatile agents during induction.

**Pre-induction:**  
Use a priming dose of a non-depolarizer or succinylcholine for an RSI.  
Connect fluids up to the warmer ASAP.

Keep patient as covered as possible.  
Bair Hugger on after central line is placed.  
200 -500 cc fluid bolus should precede induction in most patients.

  
**Induction to PRE-CLAMP PERIOD:** Goals  
Avoid HTN: You don’t want HTN to cause the aneurysm to rupture.  
Give 0.5 g/kg of Mannitol (usually (12.5-25g) 30 minutes before cross clamping.  
Have Lasix available.  
The surgeon will inform you when and how much to administer.

  
**PREPARATION FOR AORTIC CROSS CLAMPING**  
Nitroglycerine, and/or Milrinone should be available.  
While the aorta is cross clamped, high pressures are needed to perfuse the organs which are clamped distally. Now you are relying on collateral circulation through the kidneys and spine.  
**CaCl:** Check Ionized Ca levels.

_**The higher the clamp, the harder it is on the heart and the rest of the vascular tree.**_

While the patient is clamped, you should also keep giving volume and be preparing to prevent a BP drop when the surgeon unclamps the aorta.  
  
**COMPLICATIONS OF AORTIC CROSS CLAMP PLACEMENT:**  
Two of the most concerning complications of aortic cross clamp placement are renal failure and paraplegia.  
**Increased Risk of Renal Failure When There Is:**  
Preexisting renal disease.  
\>30 minutes cross clamp time.  
Hypovolemia and decreased CO when not using partial or complete bypass.

**Renal Protection:**  
Vascular Clamping significantly decreases renal blood flow which may contribute to renal failure.  
Mannitol, Lasix, Dopamine, and Fenoldopam may be used. This depends on the surgeon’s needs.  
Mannitol is the most important: give 0.5-1.0 g/kg prior to aortic cross clamping.  

**Facts about Paraplegic results:**The Anterior spinal cord is the most prone to ischemia because it is only supplied by one artery.  
Prolonged spinal cord ischemia occurs due to a lack of radicular blood supply during aneurysm repair. It is most prevalent when the time of Cross Clamp >30—45 minutes or during periods of Perioperative hypotension.  
  
**Methods to help prevent large BP drops with unclamping:**  
Decrease your patient’s anesthetic depth.  
Achieve a hypervolemic state while clamped.  
Hopefully the surgeon will release cross clamping slowly.

Begin to infuse some Neosynephrine before the clamp is removed.

**Unclamping:**  
With the unclamping, you will see “reactive hyperemia” because of a drop in SVR from metabolites in ischemic tissue.  
Lactic acid dilates veins and arteries.  
Some surgeons request NaHCO3.

You can increase minute ventilation to help control acidosis.  
The hypocarbia associated with increased ventilation will help constrict vessels and decrease perfusion to tissues proximal to the clamp, thereby diverting blood flow to ischemic tissues distal to the clamp.

**Late Operative and Postoperative Considerations:**  
These patients frequently get facial, scalp, and airway edema. With all the edema, extubation is usually not recommended until the edema subsides. Elevation of the patient’s HOB overnight helps. There is a lot of fluid shifts post op that can cause pulmonary issues. This is the main reason we usually do not extubate immediately despite the patient looking ready.

  
**The Spinal cord has a blood supply from 3 sources:**  
1\. One Anterior spinal artery.  
2\. Two posterior spinal arteries.  
3\. A network of very small segmental spinal arteries. These segmental arteries augment arterial blood flow through the anterior and posterior arteries.

Again, the Anterior spinal cord is most prone to ischemia because it is only supplied by one artery.

**Possible Complications:**Ruptured aneurysm.  
Cardiac and pulmonary problems.  
Damage to a nerve, causing pain or numbness in the leg.  
Damage to the intestines or other nearby organs.  
Infection of the graft.  
Injury to the ureter(s).  
Incisional hernia.  
Spinal cord injury.  
Sexual dysfunction.  
Lower extremity paralysis.
