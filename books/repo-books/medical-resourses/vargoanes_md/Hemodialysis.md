### Hemodialysis - Removal of Anticoagulants

_Little information and data exist for utilizing hemodialysis for the removal of an anticoagulant of an overdosed patient._  
  
Hemodialysis is sometimes mentioned in literature for the removal of some anticoagulants during an overdose. Almost all the literature pertains to an overdose of dabigatran.  
  
Dabigatran is poorly protein bound in the plasma and able to be removed by hemodialysis.  
Dabigatran excretion is 80–85% renal which makes hemodialysis an easy option.  
  
**Direct factor Xa oral inhibitors cannot be removed with dialysis.**  
Direct factor Xa oral inhibitors are mainly protein bound with only 25 to 35% renal excretion, therefore hemodialysis is not an option for the direct factor "Xabans."  
  
Hemodialysis can remove dabigatran depending on the amount present in the plasma.  
Drug levels have been shown to rebound upon cessation of hemodialysis from tissue rebound, therefore, prolonged dialysis may be considered only in selected situations.  
  
In general, the longer the dialysis, the less the amount of rebound observed, and higher blood flow rates above 400 ml/min may not proportionally improve removal.  
  
Fondaparinux (Arixtra) hemodialysis reduces by about 20%.  
Dabigatran as a last resort.  
Ticagrelor (Brilinta) cannot be removed by dialysis.  
Eptifibatide (Intergrilin) may be removed by dialysis.  
Tirfiban (Aggrastat) Can be removed by dialysis.
