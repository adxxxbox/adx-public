### Epidural Test Dose - Review Notes and Facts

  
_Ashler Zelikson, CRNA_

The purpose of a test dose is to detect an accidental intravascular or subarachnoid injection with a local anesthetic. Test dosing in the laboring patient may be controversial, but we still perform the procedure.  
  
The anesthesia provider MUST be able to recognize the possible range of responses for a positive test dose within 3-5 minutes after the test dose is administered.  
_  
NOTE: The monitoring for HR increase is most easily done by placing a pulse oximeter probe on the patient and observing the HR continuously following test dose. It is prudent to palpate a peripheral pulse during this interval as well._  
  
There are many epidural test dose cocktails due to the history of failing to identify a misplaced catheter. There have been several case reports or case series published in which the test dose not only failed to identify the catheter misplacement but may even have induced a serious adverse event.  
  
**Why Epinephrine and Lidocaine are mixed together in a test dose  
**The epinephrine in an epidural test dose is for ruling out an **intravascular** placed catheter.  
The lidocaine in an epidural test dose is for ruling out a **subarachnoid** placed catheter.  
  
**A positive test dose result informs you the epidural catheter is not in the epidural space and may have unintentionally been inserted in the following:**  
Subarachnoid space  
Subdural space  
Blood vessel-vascular  
  
**Test Dosing an epidural catheter  
**Inject a small safe dose of local anesthetic (lidocaine and epinephrine) through the epidural catheter you just inserted and then observe the patient for any signs of an accidental INTRAVASCULAR or INTRATHECAL (subarachnoid) injection.  
As we all know, a large dose of a local anesthetic in the intravascular system or intrathecal space may be detrimental as will be described below.  
  
**Every epidural bolus injection should be treated as a test dose**  
There is always the potential for migration of a previously well-positioned epidural catheter, so the administration of subsequent doses should always be performed with care. During the maintenance of labor analgesia, we use diluted “low-dose” mixtures of local anesthetic and opioid, so administration of the first dose of this “low-dose” mixture as a test dose is **now routine.**  
  
**Results of a normal test dose** A test dose within a properly placed epidural catheter does absolutely nothing for the patient. She will still be hurting with contractions with NO motor or sensory block. Do not get confused with any tachycardia onset during a painful uterine contraction.  
_(NOTE: Delayed symptoms of epinephrine administered into the epidural space and subsequently systemically absorbed may include “jitteriness” or even tremor. Similarly, delayed effects of lidocaine administered into the epidural space may produce hypesthesia or tingling due to the expected effect of epidural lidocaine on the nerve roots.)_  
  
**Test Dose with an Epidural Catheter Accidentally Placed in the Intrathecal Space  
**The normal test dose of lidocaine and epinephrine should allow easy identification of subarachnoid (intrathecal) placement of the catheter _without causing high or total spinal anesthesia and hemodynamic compromise._  
  
A test dose injected into the intrathecal space will cause a sensory and motor block at 5 minutes.  
**Example:** Just 45 mg of lidocaine injected into the CSF per epidural catheter produces a detectable sensory block (leg warmth and sensory loss to pinprick) within 1-2 minutes and a motor block (leg weakness) within 5 minutes.  
If the patient is sitting up, her butt and legs will get heavy and numb.  
If the patient is lateral, both her legs and possibly abdomen will get numb.  
  
**Normal (non-test dose) bolus injected into the intrathecal space** If you initially injected a large normal bolus into the intrathecal space, the patient would experience a high block (high spinal) with severe hypotension.  
  
**Epidural Catheter inadvertently placed intravascularly  
  
_You should always aspirate before and after all epidural injections to check for blood  
_Negative aspiration before an epidural administration  
**May not exclude intravascular catheter placement because the catheter may be against a vein wall and because aspiration can collapse the vein lumen.  
**Negative aspiration immediately following an epidural administration  
**May be more effective in recognizing intravascular catheter placement because the local anesthetic will push the vein wall away and may also dilate the blood vessels; placing the catheter 45 to 50 degrees below the patient’s body level at this stage can help the blood to flow through the catheter if it is intravascular.  
  
**Test Dose with an inadvertent Intravascularly placed Epidural Catheter  
**It may occur in as many as **7% to 8.5%** of obstetric patients, literature varies.**Note:** _Failure to recognize intravenous placement of the epidural catheter and subsequent intravenous injection of a large dose of local anesthetic may lead to systemic local anesthetic toxicity, with CNS symptoms, seizures, cardiovascular collapse, and death.  
_This is why many anesthesia providers no longer use BupivacaineSince the test dose has epinephrine in it, it should naturally increase the HR when injected **Intravascularly.  
**Increase in heart rate serves as a marker for intravenous injection.**Symptoms resulting of a test dose when the catheter is placed intravascularly** HR should increase from a mean of **80** ± 15 to **110** ± 15 beats per minute  
Should occur within 23 ± 6 seconds following the injection  
Returned to baseline within 32 ±33 seconds  
  
**Simply Stated:  
**An increase in heart rate of 20-30 bpm within 45 seconds  
An increase in systolic blood pressure of between 15 and 25 mmHg  
  
**HR may also increase with a uterine contraction – so don’t be fooled  
**The rate of increase in maternal heart rate may help distinguish a **contraction-induced increase** in heart rate.  
Tracking your patient’s contractions is essential to reduce the risk of misinterpretation of the test dose.  
Some literature states you should administer a test dose between contractions, but many experienced anesthesia providers will administer a test dose at any time, regardless of contractions.  
  
Unfortunately, it is common for frequent heart rate changes in laboring patients.  
Epinephrine containing test dose lacks both _specificity_ AND _sensitivity_ in laboring women and may produce false positive results.  
  
**Sometimes there is NO cardiovascular change with an intravascular injection** However, in pregnant women, 15 mcg of epinephrine might NOT be _sensitive or specific_ enough to rule out accidental intravascular epidural injection. This is why the use of 15 mcg of _epinephrine for the diagnosis of accidental intravascular injections remains controversial._**  
  
Is your patient on a Beta Blocker?**  
Parturients who are being treated with **β-blocking** drugs may **NOT** show tachycardia, even when the epinephrine is administered intravascularly.  
  
**Is your patient experiencing symptoms of local anesthetic toxicity?  
Ask you patient if they are experiencing:**  
Ringing in their ears  
Metallic taste in their mouth  
Tongue numbness  
Light headedness  
Disoriented  
Blurred vision  
  
**Note:** Did you ever bolus your EGD patient with100 mg of lidocaine to blunt their gag reflex before administering propofol? They usually inform you of the metallic mouth taste and ringing in their ears.  
  
**Intravenous Epinephrine and Uterine Blood Flow**  
Intravascular epinephrine may cause a _transient decline in uterine blood flow as a result of α-adrenergic receptor–mediated constriction of the uterine arteries_ but this effect is transient and _comparable to the decrease that occurs during a uterine contraction_ .In healthy parturients, any transient effect of epinephrine on uterine blood flow likely represents a less severe insult than systemic local anesthetic toxicity.  
  
**Patients with Severe Hypertension  
**An epinephrine-containing test dose may not be appropriate in parturients with _severe hypertension or uteroplacental insufficiency._  
  
**False Positive Test Dose (Intravascular) for a Properly Placed Epidural Catheter  
**A positive HR response to an epinephrine-containing test dose may occurs up to 20% of patients – _in_ _whom the catheter is in reality **NOT** intravascular._ This may result in removing a properly placed epidural catheter followed by repeating the epidural procedure.  
  
**False Negative Test Dose for an Epidural Catheter Accidentally Placed Intravascularly** An increase in HR is observed in only 50% of laboring women for INCORRECTLY placed epidural catheters (literature varies).  
This is why an incorrectly placed epidural catheter may be missed.  
Thus, other possible symptoms – especially for neural toxicity – should be assessed.  
  
**Other means of identifying intravascular placement (that we don’t normally use).  
**  
**_Bupivacaine_** use for test-dose is almost universally abandoned due to its high cardiotoxicity.  
**_Isoproterenol_** , being a highly specific β agonist , would have been a better marker than epinephrine in a test dose, but it isn’t approved for epidural injection.  
Injecting of **_air via epidural catheter_** to identify intravascular placement by the use of precordial Doppler ultrasonography has been described, but not used in real life due to being cumbersome and requiring special skills. Furthermore, injecting additional air into epidural space may adversely affect distribution of the block.  
_NOTE: See my earlier note regarding agitated saline with microbubbles and precordial Doppler._  
  
**Intravascular Test Dose  
****The most common intravascular test dose contains epinephrine 15 mcg** **causing an** **increase in heart rate that serves as a marker for intravenous injection.  
  
Witnessing a HR increase following a test dose**  
Don’t get alarmed. Unfortunately, HR increases are observed in around 50% of laboring women (literature varies). This also means the other 50% will not have that – there will be no increase in HR and  
an incorrectly placed epidural catheter may be missed.  
  
**Lidocaine is more reliable than 2-Chloroprocaine for intravascular symptoms following a test dose**  
100 mg of Lidocaine is a reliable marker following a test dose for symptoms of tinnitus and funny taste **Lidocaine: tinnitus** and **funny taste** showed a sensitivity of 100%; specificity 81%.  
**2-Chloroprocaine: tinnitus** and **funny taste** showed a sensitivity of sensitivity 81% to 94%; specificity 69% to 81%.  
  
**100 mcg of Fentanyl** has been described as a test for intravenous injection and with **dizziness** as the most reliable symptom of the intravenous injection (sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 92%). Some situations reduce the reliability of subjective symptoms as a signal of intravenous injection of a drug. Other symptoms were sedation, euphoria, and/or analgesia.  
  
**Subjective Symptoms  
**All tests that rely on the **self-reporting of subjective** **symptoms** **_require clear communication with the patient and thus are less useful when the anesthesia provider and patient speak different languages._**  
Patient exhaustion and/or prior opioid administration also may affect the reliability of the test.  
  
**Test Doses should be rapidly infused  
_Speed of injection_** may affect the reliability of the epidural test dose.  
An epinephrine-containing test dose should be injected rapidly; otherwise rapid redistribution and metabolism of the drug decrease the actual dose administered to chronoreceptors.  
  
**Multi-orifice epidural catheters  
**Multi-orifice epidural catheters have three potential sites of exit for injected fluid or air, and the orifices may lie within two different body compartments.If injected too slowly, air or fluid preferentially exits the proximal orifice. The speed of injection used in clinical practice typically exceeds that required to ensure that fluid will exit all three orifices. The distal orifice is both the most difficult to test and the one most likely to be positioned outside the epidural space.  
  
The incidence of false negative aspiration is lower for multiorifice epidural catheters (<1%) compared to single-hole catheters (2%).  
In conclusion, while ruling out intravascular placement, you must pay attention very closely to ALL symptoms, both epinephrine and local-anesthetic induced, while paying specific attention to the timing of their onset, progression and disappearance.  
  
**Ropivacaine** 15 mg is _NOT_ a useful intrathecal test dose because the slow onset of motor blockade precludes timely diagnosis of intrathecal injection.  
_(NOTE: Duration as well as onset may be prolonged.)  
_  
**2-Chloroprocaine** is the only local anesthetic that can be used as a single, combined **intravascular** and **intrathecal** test dose; in most patients, **100 mg** results in _dense, but not total, spinal anesthesia after intrathecal injection and produces systemic signs of subclinical toxicity (tinnitus, funny taste) after intravascular injection.  
  
_The epidural injection of local anesthetic for the purpose of ruling out intrathecal or intravascular catheter placement augments _epidural_ analgesia and should be considered in the calculation of the initial therapeutic dose of local anesthetic: it enhances the density of epidural blockade and adversely affects the ability to ambulate.
