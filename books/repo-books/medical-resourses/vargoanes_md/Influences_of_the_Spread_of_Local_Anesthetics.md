### Influences of the Spread of Local Anesthetics

**Dose -** the larger the dose (volume), the higher the block.  
  
**Concentration** \- the higher the concentration, the denser the block.  
  
**Temperature -** if the solution is cold it becomes viscous. This limits its spread within the CSF. The warmer the solution, the greater the spread. Temperature is a minor consideration.  
  
**Volume -** the greater the volume, the greater the spread. Baracity and dose of local anesthetic (along with patient position) are the most important factors that impact eventual block height.  
  
**Baracity and dose of local anesthetic** (along with patient position) are the most important factors that impact eventual block height.  
  
**CSF density** \- has an impact on the spread of local anesthetic based on the baracity of the local anesthetic.If CSF is concentrated or alternatively diluted with a higher or lower than normal specific gravity this will impact the movement of the local anesthetic medication.  
  
**Factors that affect the height of your block that you have NO control of:  
**Volume of CSF  
Density of CSF  
  
**Factors that you have control of:  
**Dose (volume/concentration)  
Site of injection  
Baricity of local anesthetics  
Posture of the patient during and after the administration of local anesthetic.  
  
**Summary: So what are the most important factors that influence your block height?  
**Baracity of local anesthetic solution.  
Position of the patient during and immediately after the injection.  
Drug dosage.  
Site of injection.
