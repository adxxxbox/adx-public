### Thymectomy for NON Myasthenia Gravis (MG)

Most of these are now robotic, but some places still do it the old fashioned way. Below is the NON Robotic technique.

The thymus is an anterior mediastinal organ and is part of the endocrine system. The role of this two-lobed organ prior to adolescence is for the processing and maturation of thymocytes, which then become T-lymphocytes and are subsequently released into the circulation. They then populate the lymphoid organs for storage until needed. Removal of the thymus as an adult has little immediate effect on the immune system, as its role has been completed.

**Thymectomy Indications:**

Tumors of the thymus gland.

Myasthenia Gravis (MG).

**_You need to find out ahead of time if you will need a double (DLT) or single lumen_** **_ETT! It all depends on the surgeon’s approach- if he needs you to drop the right lung_** **_or not. For a cervical approach, a DLT is not usually required._**

**Incision:**  
Cervical Approach or Sternotomy. More recently thoracoscopic thymectomy has been introduced as a less invasive technique as an alternative to conventional transsternal approach not requiring a DLT. A sternal saw is used to divide the sternum. The trans-sternal approach is the most often-used approach for removal of thymoma.  
  
An incision is made from 1-2cm below the sternal notch extending to the 3rd or 4th intercostal spaces. The manubrium is then divided to the level of the third or fourth interspace. The nearby structures for the surgeon to avoid are: Phrenic nerve, pericardium, and innominate vein. Hemorrhage is rare, but a very possible complication.

**Anesthetic:** General with DLT or single lumen ETT.

Muscle Relaxant: Yes, it’s OK for non Myasthenia gravis patients.

**Thoracic Epidural:** Usually

**Position:** Supine with arms tucked.

**IV Access:** 2 18G IVs

**A-line:** Usually

**Duration:** 1-2 hours.

**EBL:** 50-100mLs

**Possible Complications:**<  
Phrenic Nerve Injury  
Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury  
Pneumothorax  
Hemorrhage  
Mediastinitis

If the thymoma invades into the mediastinum, then an en bloc resection is recommended. Thymic carcinomas and thymic carcinoids have poor prognoses, regardless of the stage of the lesion.
