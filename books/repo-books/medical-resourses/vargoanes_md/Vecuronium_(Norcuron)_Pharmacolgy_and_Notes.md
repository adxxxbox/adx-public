# Vecuronium (Norcuron) Pharmacology and Notes

Nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug  
**Class:** Aminosteroid  
intermediate acting  
Nondepolarizing  
**Actions:** Skeletal muscle relaxant, paralyzes skeletal muscles including respiratory muscles.  
**Onset:** 3-5mins  
**Duration:** 25-35 mins  
Only 25% excreted by renal.No histamine or CVR effects-even at 3 x ED 95

* * *

**Indications:** To achieve paralysis  

* * *

**Contraindications:** Patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug.  
Paralysis occurs within 1 minute and lasts for approximately 30 minutes.

* * *

**Side Effects:** Prolonged paralysis, hypotension, bradycardia.

* * *

**Dosage:** 0.10 mg/kg of ideal body weight

* * *

**Routes:** IV  
Intubation Dose (mg/kg)=.1mg/kg  
No histamine or CVR effects-even at 3 x ED 95

* * *

**Pediatric Dosage:** 0.1 mg/kg.

* * *

**Drip for ICU**

Neuromuscular blocking agents are used in the ICU setting for 3 reasons: (1) to eliminate spontaneous breathing and promote mechanical ventilation (eg eliminate urge to fight the vent.) (2) Cause a pharmacologic restraint so patients do not harm themselves. (3) To decrease oxygen consumption.

* * *

**PRECAUTIONS**

* * *

**Renal Failure**: Well tolerated without clinically prolongation of neuromuscular blocking effect-esp if the pt receives scheduled. If anephric without dialysis, give a lower dose.  
Neuromuscular blocking agents may have a profound effect in patients with neuromuscular diseases (e.g., myasthenia gravis and the myasthenic syndrome).

* * *

**Hepatic Disease**: Patients with cirrhosis or cholestasis has revealed prolonged recovery time.

* * *

**Use in I.C.U.**: Used to facilitate mechanical ventilation

* * *

**C.N.S.**: It has no known effect on consciousness, the pain threshold or cerebration. The drip must be accompanied by adequate anesthesia or sedation. Narcotics and something amnestic-usually a propfol or benzodiazipine drip.  
You will want the pt amnestic and sedated-NO AWARENESS.
