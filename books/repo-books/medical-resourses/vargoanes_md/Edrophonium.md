# Edrophonium (Enlon)

The second most popular anticholinesterase drug used for the antagonist (reversal) of nondepolarizing neuromuscular drugs.  
**Only administer with 4 visible TOF twitches!**  
**Dose:** 0.5-1mg/kg  
4 TOF twitches with ++Fade: 0.5mg/kg  
4 TOF twitches with + Fade: 0.25mg/kg  
If you push it too fast, it may cause a severe bradycardia.  
Give slowly-45-60 seconds  
**Onset:** 30-60 seconds  
**Peak:** 1-5 minutes  
**Duration:** 5-20 minutes  
**Predominant site of action:** PRE-synaptic  
**Elimination:** 75% renal, 25% hepatic  
**MOA:** A quaternary ammonium anticholinesterase that lacks the carbamyl group, producing reversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase through its electrostatic attachment to the anionic site on the acetylcholinesterase enzyme.  
**Easier explanation:**  
Overall this prevents acetylcholine from correctly binding with the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, increasing the amount of acetylcholine in that region. This drastically improves the chances of 2 acetylcholine molecules to displace the muscle relaxant and bind to the alpha subunits of the nicotinic cholinergic receptors. Thus reversing paralysis and restoring neuromuscular transmission.  
Muscarinic effects are mild compared to Neostigmine  
You want to give atropine with Edrophonium because their onsets match up better. For the same reason, you want to give Neostigmine with Robinul.  
Not as popular as Neostigmine because of a shorter duration.  
Neostigmine works at the esteratic site.  
Edrophonium works at the anionic site.  
At one point, clinicians were using Edrophonium for SVT to slow down the heart. But they had problems with increased weakness.  
**Other Clinical Uses Edrophonium:**  
Diagnose and Treat Myasthenia Gravis and cholinergic crises Evaluated the presence of a Phase 2 block produced by succinylcholine.  
**Diagnostic Test for Myasthenia Gravis**  
Tensilon test (using Edrophonium) is still a popular test because it is short and quick acting.
