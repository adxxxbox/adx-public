### ECTs (Electroconvulsive Therapy)

  
_Edited by Beth Wilkes CRNA, Charlotte, NC_  

An ECT is a treatment for mental disorders in which an electric current is used to produce convulsions.  
  
**Goal:** To safely induce a seizure in the central nervous system without causing any of the frightening manifestations of a grand mal seizure. An EEG is performed throughout the seizure.  
  
**Indications:** Depression, depressive phase of bipolar disorder, some forms of schizophrenia and acute mania.

Many patients who do not respond to medication often experience dramatic improvement after ECT.

These cases are usually done in non-operating rooms near a recovery room. Patients are usually in their street clothes during these procedures.

**You will usually have several cases, so you should pre-draw up your meds below:**  
Brevitol  
Succinylcholine  
Caffeine  
Robinul  
  
**Equipment needed:**  
Standard ASA monitors  
Suction and yankauer  
LMA and Intubation equipment within arm’s reach.  
ETCO2 monitor with ETCO2 NC  
Ambu bag: Most patients bring their own rubber bite block. At some centers, a bite block and Ambu bag is provided and given to them for their scheduled repetitive treatments.

**Bedside medication vials and empty syringes for:**  
Labetalol  
Robinul and/or Atropine  
Esmolol

**Anesthetic:** General with ETCO2 NC  
**Position**: Supine, arms to the side and slight head elevation. Make sure the bed rails remain up.  
**Duration:** 20-30 minutes from in to out of the room. So chart fast.  
**EBL:** None  
**IV Access:** 22g is acceptable.

**Step by step in order:**  
Patient in the room.  
A strap with electrodes is placed around the skull.   
Tourniquets is placed on one of the lower legs or a wrist by the RN.  
Monitors and NC with ETCO2 sampling on the patient.

Time Out performed by staff.

   
**Pre-induction meds are given below:**

Caffeine 125-500mg to increase seizure duration

Robinul 0.2mg

Rubber bite block placed in the mouth  
 

**Induction and Procedure**  
Brevitol 0.75-1.5mg/kg. 80mg is a common dose.  
Lower leg tourniquet is inflated by the RN before the Sux is administered.

Succinylcholine 0.3-1mg/kg. 60mg is a common dose.  
Hyperventilation via Ambu with mask to increase seizure duration.  
Stop hyperventilation just prior to the shock.  
After fasciculations, the ECT doc starts the electric current unilaterally to the brain through the head electrode to induce the seizure.  
After the shock, you can resume managing the airway during and after the seizure as needed.  
Seizure witnessed below the tourniquet is observed and timed.  
Be prepared to manage post-shock cardiovascular changes with the bedside emergency meds.  
Patient slowly becomes responsive; then the patient may return to the holding area.

**Possible Complications**  
Hypotension, bradycardia to asystole from the immediate post shock parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) response. These are rare.  
Tachycardia, hypertension, dysrhythmias from a sympathetic response that follows the PNS response. These are more common.  
  
Stroke (rare): Vasoconstriction of cerebral blood flow increases 100-140% with an increased ICP.

Mortality: 1:50,000

**Common Side Effects**  
Confusion  
Short term memory loss  
Lethargy

**Relative Contraindications:**  
Unstable angina  
Severe osteoporosis  
CHF

Pregnancy  
Thrombophlebitis  
Detached retina  
Glaucoma  
Severe COPD  
 

**Absolute Contraindications:**  
Pheochromocytoma  
Brain mass, aneurysm or stroke within 3 months  
Increased ICP

Recent MI  
Recent Craniotomy  
  
**More Notes and facts**  
If you don’t have Brevitol, Thiopental (1.5-2mg/kg) or Etomidate 0.15-0.3mg/kg) can be administered. Good luck finding Thiopental; most pharmacies don’t stock it any more.  

Avoid using Propofol because it will shorten the seizure. Avoid Versed because benzodiazepines are anticonvulsants and will elevate the seizure threshhold.

During the procedure, the ECT doc observes the records an EEG and observes the seizure.

  
**Why the lower leg tourniquet is applied**  
The tourniquet is inflated just prior to administering succinylcholine to prevent the perfusion distal to the tourniquet. The succinylcholine is administered to PREVENT tonic and clonic seizure over the entire body (proximal the lower leg tourniquet).

This prevents massive skeletal muscle body contractions and possible bone fractures from the seizure. The seizure activity (distal to the tourniquet) is observed and timed.  
  
For an undesirably long seizure (> 2-3 minutes), Versed can be given.

ECTs may interfere with pacemaker sensing. Have a magnet available in case this happens. It may need to be interrogated pre-op and post-ECT.
