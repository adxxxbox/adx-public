# Mepivacaine

**Mepivacaine (Carbocaine, Polocaine)**  
**Class:** Amide type Local Anesthetic, intermediate duration of action.  
Maybe the #1 intermediate-acting local anesthetic we use for peripheral nerve blocks.  
**Max w/o epi: 7mg/kg not to exceed 400mg**  
Carbocaine structurally resembles Ropivacaine and Bupivacaine. Has pharmacological properties similar to Lidocaine but last longer than Lidocaine.  
**Uses:** Infiltration and transtracheal anesthesia, peripheral, sympathetic, regional (Bier block), and epidural nerve blocks.  
**Vasodilates:** NO, it lacks vasodilator properties and is a good choice when epinephrine is not indicated. Lidocaine vasodilates.  
**Infiltration 0.5-1%**  
**Onset:** Fast  
**Duration:** 60-240 mins  
**Max Dose w/o Epi:** 400mg  
**Max Dose with Epi:** 500mg  
80mL of 0.5%  
40mL of 1%  
**Peripheral Nerve Block 1-1.5%**  
**Onset:** Fast:  
**Duration:** 120-240 mins  
**Max Dose w/o Epi:** 400mg  
**Max Dose with Epi:** 500mg  
**Epidural 1.5-2%**  
**Onset:** Fast  
**Duration:** 60-180 mins  
**Max Dose w/o Epi:** 400mg  
**Max Dose with Epi:** 500mg  
**Spinal 2-4%**  
**Onset:** Fast  
**Duration:** 60-120 mins  
**Max Dose:** 100mg  
**MOA:** Like other local anesthetics, it binds to the intracellular portion of sodium channels and blocks sodium influx into nerve cells, which prevents depolarization.  
**In Detail:** Prevents transmission of nerve impulses by inhibiting the passage of Na ions through their specific channels. It is speculated that local anesthetics bind to specific sites on the inner portion of the Na channels (internal gate or H gate) near their external openings to maintain those channels in an inactivated state.  
**Protein Bound: 75%**  
**Metabolism of Carbocaine:**  
Not detoxified by the circulating plasma esterases. 5 percent to 10 percent excreted unchanged in the urine.  
**Metabolism: Liver,** > 50% is excreted into the bile as metabolites.  
Most of the metabolized drug is probably resorbed in the intestine and then excreted into the urine since only a small percentage is found in the feces.  
  
**Principle rout of excretion:** Kidneys  
Hydroxylation and N-demethylation, which are detoxification reactions, play important roles in the metabolism of the anesthetic.  
  
**Metabolites:**  
Two phenols, which are excreted almost exclusively as their glucuronide conjugates, and the N-demethylated compound (2´ 6´pipecoloxylidide).  
**CNS and Cardiac Manifestations to watch for:**  
Euphoria  
Dizziness  
Tinnitus  
Twitching  
Tremors  
Convulsions  
Hypotension  
Cardiac Arrest
