### Heparin Resistance

Heparin resistance is defined as the failure to raise the ACT to expected levels despite an adequate dose of Heparin. A congenital condition or acquired AT-III (antithrombin III) deficiency is associated with heparin resistance.  
  
Prior treatment with heparin can cause a depletion or dysfunction of AT-III.  
  
Another cause is the presence of large quantities off heparin-binding protein in circulation, which binds to and inactivates heparin.  
Administering additional heparin boluses up to 600-800 U/kg may be necessary to obtain an ACT level sufficient for CPB.  
  
Fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) can be given because it contains AT-III.  
  
Supplemental AT-III concentrate is another alternative and provides greater protection from side effects, allergic reaction, or disease transmission from FFP.
