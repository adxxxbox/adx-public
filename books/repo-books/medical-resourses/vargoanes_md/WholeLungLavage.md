### Anesthesia for Whole Lung Lavage (WLL)

Also referred as Bronchoalveolar **lavage**  
A lung is flushed out with large quantities of saline.   
WWL is he gold standard therapy for Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (PAP).  
It is indicated in PAP only for patients with significant symptoms and hypoxemia.  
  
**Whole lung lavage**  
It is advised to lavage the more affected lung first for allowing better lung to provide gas exchange  
A large 15 to 20 liter bag of normal saline is hung from an IV pole.  
The fluid is warmed to 37ºC by passing through a blood warmer.  
A patient is intubated with a double lumen endotracheal tube and placement is verified per fiberoptic device.  
The lavage is performed by instilling 800 mLs to 1.5 liter doses of the warmed normal saline down the patient’s endotracheal tube via large bore tubing connected to a “Y” piece.  
The total volume is usually around 15 liters spread over 10 to 15 lavages.  
The initial lavage effluent appears thick and milky, while the final lavage appears clear.  
Effluent fluid may around 1 liter less than influent saline.  
  
**Pre-op  
**CBC and BMPBaseline or recent ABG  
CXR  
Albumin level for osmolality  
  
**Preoxygenation:** Very important  
**Induction:** RSI, patients have poor reserve  
**Intubation:** DLT with fiberoptic verification  
  
**Pediatrics-When double lumen tubes are not manufactured small enough  
**It has been documented intubating two small ETTs.  
A 3.5 cuffed ETT for the trachea.  
A 3.0 cuffed ETT in the left mainstem.  
They connected the two ETTs to an angled Y-connectors from a standard double lumen bronchial tube set.  
**To lengthen the 3.0 ETT  
**An endotracheal tube connector (arrow, inset) was used to splice two 3.0-mm ID tubes together to lengthen the endobronchial tube. The other cuffed tube was inserted in the trachea.  
Proper tube positioning can verified with a 2.2-mm OD flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope.  
  
**Inhalation agent:** Sevoflurane  
**Muscle relaxation:** Optional  
**Arterial line:** Yes for ABGs.  
ABGs before and after the procedure.  
  
**PEEP:** +5  
**Ventilation:** Volume controlled ventilation is recommended.  
  
**Positioning:  
Position:**  
Slight lateral reverse Trendelenburg for influent of fluid.  
Slight lateral Trendelenburg position for effluent of fluid  
  
After intubation, the patient is placed in the lateral recumbent position with the lung to be lavaged nondependent.  
The dependent lung is ventilated and oxygenated using one lung ventilation.  
During each instillation, the patient is slanted into the lateral reverse Trendelenburg position. After instillation of the lavage fluid, the patient is then positioned with the head down in lateral Trendelenburg followed with chest percussion (chest physiotherapy) be a respiratory therapist for four to five minutes. The Trendelenburg facilitates gravity drainage of the fluid through the endotracheal tube into a collection canister.  
**A flexible bronchoscope:** Yes, it is used as needed, to inspect the lung and suction residual fluid.  
**Duration:** 3-6 hours. Depends on how many lavages.  
  
**Foley:** Yes  
**Avoid hypothermia:** Lower body blanket can be used and warm IV fluid/  
Lavages may be performed using 1000 ml – 1200 ml aliquots of normal saline warmed to body temperature  
Respiratory therapist may be present for chest percussions while fluid is indwelling to help loosen the proteinaceous material.  
  
**Possible complications:  
**Pneumothorax  
Intraoperative hypoxemia  
Facial soft tissue edema resulting of absorption of electrolytes into the third space.  
Displacement of the DLT and a leak through the DLT resulting in spillage of lavage fluid into the ventilated lung. The procedure has to be terminated immediately and the DLT can be replaced with single lumen ETT in case of sudden displacement.  
  
**Signs of loss of lung isolation with spillage of lavage fluid into the ventilated lung**  
Bubbles in the lavage fluid draining from the lavaged side.  
Increased resistance to ventilation (increased peak inspiratory pressure).  
Increased rales and rhonchi on the ventilated side.  
Decreased SaO2 and increased ETCO2  
  
**CXR:** After the procedure, an upright CXR is obtained to exclude pneumothorax.  
  
**Post procedure  
**The DLT will be replaced with a standard 8.5 mm ETT and the patient will be transported to an ICU and remain intubated and ventilated for an additional 16 hours to permit clearing of secretions and the trachea got extubated the next morning.  
  
**More Notes**  
A special Marrano double-lumen tube which is available for smaller children cannot be used for WLL. This tube is uncuffed and therefore cannot protect the ventilated lung.  
Sever cases may utilize ECMO or venous to venous cardiopulmonary bypass.  
For cardiac patients, some anesthesia providers recommend a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) assessment prior to this procedure to evaluate cardiac function and during WLL for assessment of the lung tissue.
