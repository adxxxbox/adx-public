### Gastric Pacemaker Insertion

A reversible therapy that electrically stimulates the antrum of the stomach to help control nausea and vomiting of patients with gastroparesis.

The system consists of two single-electrode gastric leads and a neurostimulator plus a programmer. The surgeon can switch the device off or surgically remove it, if necessary.  
First, two electrodes are placed 1 cm apart deep in the antral muscle of the stomach. Then a neurostimulator is placed in a subcutaneous pocket in the lower abdominal wall on either the right or left side. This stimulator is similar to a TENS nerve stimulator or a cardiac pacemaker. The lead wires are then connected to the stimulator.

An EGD is then done to assure the electrodes did not perforate the gastric mucosa.  
This procedure is usually laparoscopic, sometimes robotic but rarely an open procedure.   
**Indications**: Gastroparesis  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT with RSI.  
**Duration:** 60-90 minutes  
**Position** Supine with slight reverse Trendelenburg.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
**Anti-emetics:** Yes  
**OGT:** Yes; the surgeon will want the stomach decompressed.  
**EGD:** Yes; at the end of the case.  
**EBL:** Minimal  
 

**Common Contraindications:**  
Eating disorders  
Narcotic dependence  
Future likelihood of MRIs  
 

**Possible Complications:**  
Pulmonary embolism  
Perforation of the stomach  
Dislodgement of the device head

  
**More Notes:**  
The surgeon uses the programmer during and after the operation to adjust the neurostimulator settings. The device delivers electrical stimuli to the stomach wall that is a higher frequency than the intrinsic gastric slow wave of normal GI peristalsis.  
 

**Gastroparesis**:  
Delayed gastric emptying due to abnormal motility, without mechanical outlet obstruction, is a chronic, debilitating condition with significant morbidity. Affecting mostly young and middle-aged women, gastroparesis presents with nausea, abdominal pain, early satiety, vomiting, bloating, anorexia, and weight loss. Persistent nausea and vomiting, the most disabling symptoms, don’t always respond to traditional treatment.

An estimated 25-30% of people with diabetes may have gastroparesis.

  
**Gastric Retention** of more than 10% of a standard low-fat meal at 4 hours is indicative of delayed emptying. Patients with this condition have frequent hospital admissions, loss of employment, lesser educational opportunities and a dismal future.

Although most gastroparesis is idiopathic (36%), the autonomic dysfunction resulting from uncontrolled and longstanding diabetes accounts for 29% of all gastroparesis patients. This procedure is reversible; the stimulator can be turned off at any time by the motility specialist.

**Results and complications**  
In a large published study, 55 patients (67%) were considered successfully treated and experienced a 50% decrease in total symptoms. This study also demonstrated that, on average, not only is gastric emptying improved but the neurostimulator is a powerful anti-nausea and antiemetic therapy device as well. Evidence suggests that it cannot produce the same reduction in excess weight as bariatric surgery such as the roux-en-Y or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (lap band).
