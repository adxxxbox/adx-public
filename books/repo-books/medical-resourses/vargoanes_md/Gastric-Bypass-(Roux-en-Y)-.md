Gastric Bypass (Roux-en-Y)     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Gastric Bypass (Roux-en-Y)

**Procedure:** The stomach is divided, and a small pouch is formed while simultaneously the majority of the stomach is sealed off. A portion of the small intestine is then divided and sewn to the newly created small stomach pouch. This process limits the body’s ability to absorb calories. This procedure is usually laparoscopic. 

Besides an elevated BMI, many of these patients also have DM type II and OSA. Following the procedure after the patient has recovered, the patient will usually feel full after a ½ cup of food.  

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT, usually RSI. Sellick’s maneuver. Glidescope in the room.  
 

Believe it or not, most of these patients are easy intubations. Some CRNAs still insist on inserting blankets under the patient’s shoulders to obtain an optimal sniffing position.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Yes

**Duration:** 45 minutes -2 hours. Depends on the surgeon.

**Position:** Supine with reverse Trendelenburg. Patient is placed in a straight leg lithotomy and the patient’s legs are wrapped with wide Ace bandaging. Arms are abducted.  
**Ventilation:** When you combine a pneumoperitoneum which decreases respiratory compliance with obesity, you could expect elevated peak pressures. Despite being in reverse Trendelenburg to counter this, the patient may still require PCV mode; you should always add PEEP.     
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable. Start hydrating early in PACU due to their bowel prep.

**EBL:** Minimal  
**Esophageal Temp Probe:** NO, unless it’s around the oropharynx.

**OGT:** Yes: the stomach needs to be initially emptied.  
**Bowel Prep:** Yes, expect them to be volume depleted.

**Neo Drip:** Usually; reverse Trendelenburg and being dry is not good for blood pressure.  
**Bougie:** Some surgeons prefer to use a 28-30F bougie to size the pouch at the proximal area of the stomach. You will be asked to place it down the esophagus. Make sure you lubricate the bougie and don’t force it.

**Methylene Blue (leak test):**  You may be asked to insert a large hollow gastric tube down the esophagus. This tube is similar to an Ewald tube used in most Emergency Departments to do gastric lavage. After ETT is secured, place the gastric tube. It has a series of vented openings at the distal tip and an open port at the proximal end. The surgeon will instruct you with the depth of insertion while he/she is viewing the laparoscopic video screen. You will be asked to pour some Methylene Blue (mixed with saline by the circulator in a bowl) through this tube to enable the surgeon to check for leaks. At our facility, we use a Tuohy catheter tip syringe with a volume of 100ccs.

After the tube is placed and you get the blue dyed water or NSS, separate the Tuohy syringe plunger from the barrel. Place the tip of the syringe in the proximal end of the Ewald tube, then carefully pour the ordered volume into the barrel of the syringe, watching the level on the graduated syringe barrel. Then simply raise the syringe barrel upwards and let gravity assist in allowing the dyed water to trickle down the syringe and through the gastric tube. If there are any leaks, the surgeon will see the blue dye leaking out under laparoscopic direct vision and can take appropriate action. When you are done, see if there is a slide clamp on the gastric tube. If there is, use it, and then pull the gastric tube out. It is messy, and the tricky part is pulling out the large gastric tube without spilling any of the methylene blue water on your patient’s face.

Sometimes these tubes have a balloon that inflates (like an endotube) and the surgeon will ask you to inflate it and pull back a little. The surgeon wants to see resistance. This is to check the Hiatus for a hernia.

**Emergence:** Elevate the HOB or keep the bed in reverse Trendelenburg. Many of these patients still desaturate due to a poor reserve. Large manual breaths (tidal volumes) with inspiratory holds (pulmonary recruitment) will increase the patient’s FRC. These will counter the desaturations during emergence.      
Dumping Syndrome  
Hemorrhage  
Difficult airway  
Desaturations with emergence  
Leaks from staple lines

**Preoperative Comorbidities:**  
Hypertension: 42%  
Diabetes: 29%  
GERD: 70%  
Orthopedic Problems: 94%

The dreaded complication of gastric bypass surgery is an anastomotic leak from the gastrojejunal anastomosis, with resulting peritonitis. Other anastomotic problems are anastomotic dehiscence, stenosis, or ulcer formations.

Standard discharge medications included a daily multivitamin, vitamin B-12 500 micrograms daily, and calcium supplementation.

According to the American Society for Bariatric Surgery and the National Institutes of Health, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is the gold standard procedure for weight loss surgery.
