### Factor I Deficiency

**Review:** Fibrinogen is converted to fibrin by thrombin for platelet aggregation.  
**Factor I Deficiency** An inherited bleeding disorder that affects platelets and clotting.  
All types of factor I deficiency affect both males and females.  
  
**Factor I (Fibrinogen) Deficiency could be:  
Quantitative:** Deficiency of fibrinogen.  
**Qualitative:** Change in quality **–** abnormal function of fibrinogen.  
  
**Normal plasma fibrinogen adult levels:** 2.0-4.0 g/L **–** (200-400 mg/dl)  
Fibrinogen is measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl):  
Fibrinogen < 50 mg/dl = danger of bleeding after surgery.  
Fibrinogen > 700 mg/dl = high risk for DVT and PE.  
**Labs:** _Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements  
or may test different specimens._  
  
**Clause method:** Used to measure the fibrinogen concentration **–** 30-60 minute turn-around.**Thromboelastometry:** Can measure fibrin(ogen).  
_**Fibrinogen antigen test:**_ Usually a follow-up test to determine whether decreased fibrinogen activity is due to insufficient fibrinogen or dysfunctional fibrinogen (caused by inherited or acquired dysfibrinogenemia).  
**PT-derived fibrinogen (FIB PT ) assay  
**Immunological**** **a** **ssays  
Gravimetric** **a** **ssays**  
  
**Quantitative:  
****Afibrinogenemia** (a complete lack of fibrinogen).  
**Hypofibrinogenemia** (low levels of fibrinogen).  
**Perioperatively, hypofibrinogenemia may be treated with:** (more in detail below)  
Purified human fibrinogen-no blood typing or thawing is necessay.  
Cryoprecipitate.  
FFP.  
  
**Qualitative**  
**Dysfibrinogenemia -** Defects of fibrinogen.  
**Hypodysfibrinogenemia -** Combined defect that involves both low levels of fibrinogen and impaired function.  
  
**Afibrinogenemia** (complete lack of fibrinogen)  
An autosomal recessive disorder (both parents must carry the defective gene in order to pass it on to their child).  
Typically diagnosed in newborns.  
Often presents as bleeding from the umbilical cord, GU tract, or CNS.  
  
**Hypofibrinogenemia, dysfibrinogenemia and hypodysfibrinogenemia** can be either recessive (both parents carry the gene) or dominant (only one parent carries and transmits the gene).  
  
**Symptoms of factor I deficiency -** depend on which form of the disorder a person has.  
  
**Afibrinogenemia Common Symptoms**  
Nosebleeds (epistaxis).  
Easy bruising.  
Heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia).  
Muscle bleeds.  
Bleeding into joints (hemarthrosis).  
Bleeding from the umbilical cord stump after birth.  
Bleeding in the mouth, particularly after dental surgery or tooth extraction.  
Abnormal bleeding during or after injury, surgery or childbirth.  
Abnormal bleeding after circumcision.  
Problems during pregnancy (including miscarriage).  
  
**Other reported symptoms of Afibrinogenemia  
**GI bleed.  
CNS bleeds (head or spinal cord).  
Thrombosis.  
  
**Hypofibrinogenemia and Symptoms (lower levels)  
**Fibrinogen level < 100 mg/dL.  
Symptoms can range from mild, moderate, to severe.  
The less fibrinogen, the more frequent and/or severe the symptoms.  
  
**Dysfibrinogenemia (abnormal function) Symptoms  
**Patients rarely present with bleeding.  
Some are predisposed to thrombosis and mat require anticoagulants.  
Some people experience bleeding (similar to those seen in afibrinogenemia).  
  
**Hypodysfibrinogenemia Symptoms (low amount and abnormal quality)**  
Symptoms are variable and depend on the amount of fibrinogen that is produced and how it is functioning.  
  
**Possible causes of** **High fibrinogen values:  
**Infections and inflammation  
Cancer  
Rheumatoid arthritis  
Nephrotic syndrome  
Heart attack  
Stroke  
Pregnancy  
  
**Possible causes of** **Low Fibrinogen values:  
**Liver disease  
DIC  
Cancer  
Malnutrition  
Inherited or congenital blood clotting disorders  
Frequent blood transfusions  
Cell saver during surgery  
  
**Treatment**  
Fibrinogen concentrate (purified human fibrinogen (lyophilized)  
Cryoprecipitate  
Fresh frozen plasma (FFP)  
Fibrin sealant **–** Tisseel, Crosseal or Evicyl-topical hemostatis.  

Purified human fibrinogen in acute bleeding episodes involving deficiencies.  
Therapeutic level target is 1.0-1.5 g/L (100-150 mg/d/l  
In patients with congenital hypofibrinogenemia, the half-life is reported to be 78 plus or minus 18 hours.
