### Bowel Preps

_Not all bowel Preps leave a patient dry!_  
(also known as Mechanical Bowel Prep – MBP)  

**There are two types of Bowel Preps**  
**Hyperosmotic:** Older and draw fluid into the intestines – cause fluid and electrolyte shifts  
**Osmotically Balanced** – non-absorbable and do not draw in fluid into the intestines  

We have been taught to believe that a patient who receives a bowel prep for a colon surgery is probably dehydrated. We will commonly assume the patient needs 1-2 liters from being NPO 12 hours and from losing volume from the bowel prep. This is no longer the case.

**Hyperosmotic Bowel Preparations**  
The older bowel preps commonly used were hyperosmotic. Unfortunately, these preps exert an osmotic effect – drawing water into the intestines leading to fluid and electrolyte shifts. This can be associated with dehydration renal damage with anesthesia. These hypertonic solutions contribute to metabolic disarray and possible adverse physiologic side-effects perioperatively. Because these are hyperosmotic, they require the administration of much less volume than the osmotically balanced

**Hyperosmotic Preparations**  
Magnesium citrate  
Sodium phosphate  

**Osmotically Balanced- Polyethylene Glycol (PEG)**  
These are the newer osmotically balanced bowel preps and are now the most popular today in the U.S. Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) is the new standard MBP. Unfortunately, it involves the consumption of 4 liters and has a salty taste. It is nonabsorbable and passes through the GI tract without absorption or secretion, thus, not affecting electrolyte changes or fluid shifts. Common side-effects are nausea and vomiting that affect 4-17%.

**Osmotically Balanced Preparations**  
GoLYTELY  
Colyte  
NuLytely  
TriLyte  

**Low Volume PEG Solutions**  
Due to the many complaints from patients having to consume 4 liters, the low volume PEGs combined with cathartic agents have been developed.  
HalfLyetely  
MoviiPrep  
Miralax  
BiPeglyte

| Bowel Preps | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Polyethylene Glycol (PEG), GoLytely and Colyte | Safe | Large volume and poor taste |
| Sulfate-free PEG (NuLytely, TriLyte) | Safe, better taste | Large Volume |
| Low-volume sulfate solution(SUPREP) | Lower volume | Risk of electrolyte fluctuation and renal dysfunction |
| Low-volume PEG and bisacodyl (HalfLytely) | Safe, lower volume | 2L solution – still sizable amount |
| Ascorbic acid lavage (MoviPrep) | Safe, better taste | Use with caution in patients with G6PD deficiency |
| Sodium phosphate: Liquid form Visicol tablets OsmoPrep tablets | Small volume | Requires a high concentration |
| Magnesium citrate via PEG | Lower volume PEG required. | Caution with renal dysfunction |
