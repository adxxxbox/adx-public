Intussusception Repair and Anesthesia   

### Intussusception Repair and Anesthesia

  
_Edited by Mary McDonough Smith, CRNA_\>

This case is an emergency bowel obstruction and possible colon resection. These patients may be very sick/septic and present with severe bowel obstruction pathology. Optimally, the patient has been rehydrated and stabilized prior to surgery. Often an air or barium anema has been done; aiding in diagnosis and even curative.

**Anesthetic Concerns  
**

**Full Stomach:**  
Due to emergent procedure and/or nature of obstructed bowel, most can assume significant gastric volumes even in presence of adequate fasting times, making an RSI necessary. Regardless of nausea/vomiting present, surgery delay and/or postponement will NOT aid in reducing nausea/vomiting. Surgery should proceed to correct the initial bowel obstruction, etc.

A nasogastric tube may be present, which will aid in decreasing the risk of aspiration. Weight the risk/reward of attempting to place a naso/gastric tube to aid in reducing the aspiration risk prior to surgery/induction.

**Fluid Balance:** Adequate correction of hypovolemia, electrolyte impairments, and third space fluid shifts is essential before surgery to decrease patient’s risk of intraoperative complications.

**Hypovolemia:** Due to decreased intake, nausea, vomiting, and third-spacing.

**Electrolyte impairment** : Check labs. Metabolic Acidosis: Gangrenous bowel may cause severe metabolic acidosis with abnormal electrolytes. If protracted vomiting, hypokalemia may be present.

**Is there edema or third spacing present?**

The surgeon may not be able to close the abdomen at the end of the procedure when severe edema or third spacing is present. You may not be able to extubate.

**Potential for ischemia/strangulated bowel/Septicemia?**

If patient has “currant jelly” (bloody mucous) present, this may indicate gangrene, which can lead to bowel perforation.

Guides the urgency of case, regardless of child being medically optimized or not. Must be prepared to treat hemodynamic instability with volume replacement, inotropes, and/or vasopressors. Watch for acute instability when bowel is manipulated (releasing chemical mediators causing hypotension) or when bowel reperfused (“washing out” of chemical mediators causing vasodilation/hypotension).

Sepsis present? (High WBC, high bands, high lactate, inflammatory markers) Appropriate antibiotics given before surgery, be aware of ALI, or further monitoring needed (CVC, arterial line).

**Abdominal compartment syndrome:**

**Organ function:** Renal, hepatic secondary to increased abdominal pressure.

**Respiratory** : Abdominal distention can impede diaphragmatic movement and also increase the risk of aspiration.

**Post-operative pain management:**  
Open procedure or laparscopic? What options are available at your facility if open procedure, necessitating a regional technique? Usually epidural or TAP blocks.

**Pre-op (Most below should be surgeon’s responsibility)**

What bowel obstruction pathology is present?

Signs of sepsis or shock?

Signs of dehydration or has the patient been adequately rehydrated?  
NGT to intermittent suction? Is the stomach empty?

**X-ray** : confirming NGT placement?  
**Labs:** CBC and electrolytes.  
**ABG:** Acid/base balance?  
**WBC results** ? Elevated white count may indicate peritonitis or infection (sepsis).  
Gangrenous bowel may result in severe metabolic acidosis and require correction of electrolyte abnormalities.

**Blood Available:** Donor Blood should be Type and Crossed with PRBCs available.

Abdominal x-ray-may reveal multiple fluid levels.

**Surgical Procedure:**  
Intussuseption can often be reduced laparoscopically even in neonate or infants (often an incidental appendectomy is performed) if not, an open repair with an incision in right lower quadrant is made. If gangrenous bowel is present, resection and primary anastomosis usually done. It is the surgeon’s preference.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
**Induction:** RSI  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Yes  
**Nitrous Oxide** : NO  
**OGT/NGT:** Yes, one should have already been inserted, place on suction during induction to prevent aspiration.  
**Position** : Supine  
**Epidural for post op pain:** Rarely done.  
**IV Access:** 2 large bore or a central line. Most of these kids already have an IV.  
**IV Fluid:** Depends on the electrolyte status and blood glucose levels.  
Can be D5W, ½ NSS or NSS.

**Hydration: 4:2:1** **(below is just a common reference)**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**A-line** : Sometimes, depends on severity of the patient.

**Blood tubing:** Have readily available.  
**PRBCs available** : Yes.  
**Duration:** 1-3 hours  
**EBL:** usually minimal  
**T&C:** Usually, in case there is a bleed: have units readily available.

**Extubation:** Depends on the presence of edema and/or third spacing. If edema is severe and the surgeon cannot close the abdomen, do not extubate. Return the patient extubated to the unit.

**Possible Complications  
**Perforation of the bowel  
Wound infection  
UTI  
Excessive bleeding  
Formation of adhesions
