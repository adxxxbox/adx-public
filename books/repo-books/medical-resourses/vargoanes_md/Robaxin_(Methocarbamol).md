### Robaxin® (Methocarbamol)

Robaxin **®** is being more commonly used in an off-label application prophylactically in attempt to reduce muscle spasms in certain patients.  
Robaxin **®** also has sedative effects.  
  
_Methocarbamol is available as an injectable solution Each ml contains:_ methocarbamol, USP 100 mg, polyethylene glycol 300, NF 0.5 mL, Water for Injection, USP q.s. The pH is adjusted, when necessary, with hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide.  
Robaxin **®** is a centrally acting muscle relaxant that is indicated for painful musculoskeletal conditions.  
Postoperative muscle spasms can be severe and incapacitating.  
Muscle relaxants can reduce the symptoms while healing and treatment can occur.  
  
**Other known indication:**  
Control of painful muscle spasm caused by black widow spider envenomation.  
Control of muscle spasms caused by mild tetanus or strychnine poisoning.  
  
**Indications for off-label use of** **Robaxin** **® by anesthesia providers**  
Back procedures necessitating large incisions (involving large muscle groups) and some laminectomies for patients with chronic back pain.Younger muscular patients during back procedures.  
Patients with fibromyalgia undergoing long back procedures.  
During back procedures for patients already receiving multimodal anesthesia for pain management.  
Shoulder procedures in beach chair position for patients with a history of back pain  
EP lab and other vascular procedures: patients cannot sit up after the procedure due to catheterizations through the groin.  
**Long procedures for patients with back pain who normally do not** **lie supine due to back pain:**  
Aortogram run-off and other vascular procedures for patients with history of back pain.  
Long MRI procedures.  
  
In recent studies where **Robaxin®** was used for up to 8 days, 44% of patients who took it had complete pain relief (compared to 18% who took nothing).  
**  
Robaxin®**  
**Mechanism of action:** Unknown; it is thought to cause inhibition of carbonic anhydrase and may interact with NMDA receptors.  
It DOES NOT directly relax skeletal muscle and does not depress neuromuscular transmission or muscle excitability.  
  
**Rate of injection:** Should not exceed 3 ml per minute of the undiluted solution, especially in an awake patient.  
**Common intraoperative doses:** 1 gram IV prior to emergence.  
For the severest cases or in postoperative conditions in which oral administration is not feasible, additional doses of 1 gram may be repeated every 8 hours up to a maximum of 3 g/day for no more than 3 consecutive days.  
  
**Can also be administered IM:** No more than five ml should be injected into each gluteal region.  
  
**Other doses outside the operating room:  
Adult:** ≥16yrs: initially 1.5g 4 times daily for 2–3 days; if severe, may give up to 8g/day.  
**Maintenance:** 1g 4 times daily.  
**Pediatric dosing:** A minimum initial dose of 15 mg/kg is recommended.  
This dosage may be repeated every six hours, if required.  
The total dose should not exceed 50 mg/kg for 3 consecutive days.  
Safety and effectiveness of Robaxin **®** in pediatric patients below the age of 16 have not been established.  
  
**Elimination:** Hepatic  
**Mean plasma elimination half-life:** Ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%.  
  
**Warnings/Precautions:** Pregnancy (Cat. C). Nursing mothers.  
Robaxin **®** and/or its metabolites are excreted in the milk of dogs; however, it is not known whether methocarbamol or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Robaxin **®** injectable is administered to a nursing woman.  
  
**Possible interactions:  
**Potentiates alcohol and other CNS depressants. May antagonize pyridostigmine.Used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis receiving anticholinesterase agents.Caution should be observed in using the injectable form in patients with suspected or known seizure disorders.  
**Possible side effects (** some may have been due to rapid injection)  
Anaphylactic reaction, angioneurotic edema, fever, headache.  
  
**Cardiovascular system:** Bradycardia, flushing, hypotension, syncope, thrombophlebitis  
  
**GI:** Dyspepsia, jaundice (including cholestatic jaundice), nausea and vomiting.  
**Hemic and lymphatic system:** Leukopenia  
**Immune system:** Hypersensitivity reactions  
  
**CNS:** Amnesia, confusion, diplopia, dizziness or light-headedness, drowsiness, insomnia, mild muscular incoordination, nystagmus, sedation, seizures (including grand mal) and vertigo.  
Possible addiction or dependence. Dry mouth, anxiety fatigue and urinary retention.  
  
Caution should be observed in using the injectable form in patients with suspected or known seizure disorders.  
  
**Renally Impaired  
**The clearance of Robaxin® in 8 renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (± SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar (1.2 (± 0.6) versus 1.1 (± 0.3) hours, respectively).  
  
**Hepatically Impaired  
**In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in 8 age- and weight-matched normal subjects.  
  
The mean (± SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (± 1.62) hours and 1.11 (± 0.27) hours respectively. The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45% compared to 46 to 50% in the normal subjects.
