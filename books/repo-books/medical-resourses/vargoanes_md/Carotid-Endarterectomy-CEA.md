### Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA) Anesthesia

The removal of plaque from within the carotid artery.

**During a CEA, there can be massive BP swings due to carotid wall tension changes from manipulation of the bifurcation or carotid clamping.**

Room Set-up

-   Usually General/ETT
-   MAC on rare occasions—depends on the surgeon
-   Arterial line
-   Cerebral oximetry—depends on the surgeon
-   2 IVs
-   Atropine or Glycopyrrolate for bradycardia which may occur in the beginning of the carotid dissection.
-   Heparin—10,000 units drawn up
-   Protamine
-   Beta blockers: Have available

**Pressors for hypotension:**

Phenylephrine: Drip and a 10 cc syringe

Norepinephrine: Common for patients with a low EF -Infusion and diluted syringe.

**Vasodilators for periods of severe hypertension:**

-   Nitroglycerin (NTG) and/or Nicardipine
-   A NTG drip and 10cc syringe
-   Nicardipine drip and non-diluted syringe: More common, especially for emergence and transporting the patient to the recovery room or ICU on a pump to avoid postoperative hypertension.

**Note:** Nicardipine is generally preferred for its rapid onset of action, predictable response, and ability to increase cerebral blood flow without causing vasodilation-related issues.

It dilates cerebral and coronary arteries more selectively than other arteries, and it may be beneficial for patients with ischemic disorders.

**Pre-op Neuro Assessment:**

-   Check strength of bilateral hand grip, pushing /pulling of upper extremities and pushing strength of the feet.
-   Have them stick out their tongue.
-   The results can be compared post extubation for the sign of a stroke.
-   Don’t worry if you forget to do this because it has probably already been assessed.

**CAD Considerations:**

-   These patients have a huge buildup of plaque in a carotid artery, so they probably have some in their coronary arteries resulting in CAD.
-   Many of these patients with peripheral vascular (PVD) disease often have CAD.
-   Treat them like a CAD patient-avoid tachycardia and hpotension.

**Coexisting Diseases and Facts:**

-   Ischemic heart disease a major cause of morbidity and mortality
-   MI develops in 1-2 % of cases
-   Pre op cerebral vascular symptoms increase the risk for a post op stroke.
-   Increase age, increases the risk of strokes and death.
-   PVD- a strong predictor of perioperative stroke or death.
-   Patients with a pre-op history of angina had a mortality of 18% compared to less than 5% with those without symptoms.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT

**MAC:** Rare, Precedex infusion is recommended as the patient will need to be responsive while the carotid artery is clamped.

**Cervical Block:** Extremely rare

**Duration:** 90-150 minutes

**Position:** Supine with arms tucked

**EBL:** Depends on the surgeon. There should not be much.

**IV Access:** 2 IVs is common

**Remember the arms will be tucked, so double check the IV patency.**

**A-Line:** Always

**BP Requirement:**

Many of these patients have severe hypertension to start with.

**BP recommendation:** Usually close to the patient’s baseline.

ALWAYS ask the surgeon because they all seem to desire different BPs.

You want to elevate the BP during clamping for collateral perfusion.

When unclamped, you can lower the BP to avoid bleeding.

**Infusions:**

**NTG or Nicardipine as mentioned above:**

**NTG syringe dilution:** 2mL NTG + 8 mL of LR = 40mcg/mL

**Nicardipine hydrochloride:**

-   25 mg Nicardipine added to 250 mLs: 100 mcg/mL
-   **Infusion dose range:** 5-15 mg/hour
-   **Nicardipine syringe:** Many anesthesia providers do not dilute

**Phenylephrine:** Infusion and syringe

**Infusion dose range:** 10-200 mcg/min

**Most common:** 40-80 mcg/minute

**Syringe:** Not diluted from the bag (40-80 mcg/mL)

**BP swings:**

The most difficult part of this procedure is the management of BP.

The patient may have a systolic over 200 mmHg one second and when you treat it, the BP commonly overreacts to severe hypotension and vice versa.

The titration between your pressor and vasodilator is vital as all patients are different.

**Possible severe bradycardia with carotid transection and traction.**

Upon neck incision, consider pretreating the patient with .02 or .04 mg of glycopyrrolate.

If severe bradycardia occurs, immediately inform the surgeon.

The surgeon spray (bathe) the carotid sinus with lidocaine.

**Drugs:**

10k units Heparin

The surgeon will tell you to administer a certain amount before he/she clamps (around 100u/kg).

Let the surgeon know when 2 minutes has gone by after giving Heparin.

**Protamine:** Some surgeons don’t reverse the Heparin.

**ACTs:** Depends on the surgeon.

The more experienced surgeons may just have a 20-minute clamp time, so the surgeon is not concerned with the half-life of heparin.

The slower surgeons with much longer clamp times are more likely ask you to redose the heparin or request ACTs.

**Relaxation:** Almost always

**Position of the head:** Slightly turned away from the surgical side.

A foam donut is preferred instead of a regular pillow for better neck exposure.

A shoulder roll is often used.

**ETT Position:** Opposite of the side of incision.

Using a flex tube extension and removing the elbow piece helps keep the ETT low over the face and out of the surgeon’s field.

**Cerebral oximetry monitoring:** Sometimes

Get the baseline (preinduction) left and right base cerebral oximetry values (rSO2).

**Normal values:** 60-80%

Inform the surgeon of 20% declines.

**EEG Monitoring:** Some surgeons request it.

The EEG tech may ask you just to keep your inhalation agent consistent.

Try not to use Etomidate because it will interfere with the EEG for a period of time.

**Postoperative extubation BP:**

Ask the surgeon where he/she wants the BP.

Severe hypertension will challenge the new graft.

**Avoid hypertension with emergence:**

Prepare to treat hypertension, especially with an awake extubation.

Labetalol and a Nicardipine infusion are popular.

Nicardipine infusion: Commonly used in this scenario and postoperative BP management.

Most surgeons desire you to maintain a systolic BP < 160 mmHg.

**Emergence:**

It’s now usually OK to extubate the patient deep as long as you do not leave the room until the patient is awake enough perform a bilateral hand grip, wiggle their toes and stick out their tongue.

This is usually up to the surgeon.

**100 mg of Lidocaine with emergence:**

Some anesthesia providers will bolus the patient with 10 mLs (100 mg) of lidocaine about 5-10 prior to extubation to blunt the patient’s gag reflex.

**Transporting the patient to the recovery room or ICU:**

We usually transport the patient connected to a portable monitor to closely observe the BP.

This is when you may utilize your diluted NTG or Nicardipine syringe and a flush syringe for any increase in BP while transporting the patient.

It will not look good delivering your patient with a 200 mmHg systolic BP.

A graft leak or rupture will be blamed on you.

**Nicardipine drip already connected to the patient for the recovery room or ICU.**

Even if the patient is below the surgeon’s suggested BP, it is common for a patients post-op BP to increase as the patient becomes more awake.

This is especially true for patients with a preoperative high baseline BP.

It is extremely convenient for the postoperative nurse to already have quick access to the Nicardipine infusion to treat the onset of postoperative hypertension.

**Possible Complications:**

Hemorrhage

Stroke (embolization): Although rare, the catheter may damage the artery or knock loose a piece of the artery wall, which can block blood flow and cause a stroke.

Restenosis

**Possible nerve damage:**

Vagus nerve

Hypoglossal nerve

Superior laryngeal nerve

Glossopharyngeal nerve

Facial Nerve

Accessory nerve

**Anatomy Notes:**

Dissection must be carried out with extreme care not to injure surrounding nerves, most notably the vagus and hypoglossal nerves.

The ansa cervicalis, a branch of the hypoglossal nerve, may have to be divided to facilitate the dissection; this is acceptable.

**Information on surgical exposure and mobilization:**

-   The internal jugular vein is visualized, and the carotid sheath is opened along the anterior border of the vein.
-   The internal jugular vein is retracted laterally, and the common facial vein is ligated
-   Dissection is continued anterior to the CCA (common carotid artery) to keep from injuring the vagus nerve.
-   The vagus nerve usually lies in a posterior lateral position within the carotid sheath but occasionally may spiral anteriorly, particularly in the lower end of the incision.

\-Attention should be paid to cranial nerves IX (glossopharyngeal nerve), X (vagus nerve), XI (accessory nerve), XII (hypoglossal nerve), the marginal mandibular branch of VII (facial nerve), and the rare nonrecurrent laryngeal nerve that comes directly off the vagus to innervate the vocal cords.

\-This nerve can cross anterior to the carotid artery and can be mistaken for a part of the ansa cervicalis; if it is inadvertently divided, cord paralysis results.

\-A nonrecurrent laryngeal nerve is most often noted on the right side of the neck.
