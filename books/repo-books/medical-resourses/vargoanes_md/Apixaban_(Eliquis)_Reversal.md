### Apixaban (Eliquis) Reversal

**Consult cardiology for ALL patients with coronary stents.  
  
Quick Notes:  
Class:** Factor Xa inhibitor  
Orally administered  
**Peak Activity:**  
Rapidly absorbed, peak activity onset occurs at 3 to 4 hours.  
  
**T1/2:** 8-15 hoursApixaban is well tolerated with renal deficiency.  
Anti-Xa lab is the most reliable (see below).  
  
**Treatment for mild bleeding with Apixaban is the same for other** **Factor Xa inhibitors:  
**Fondaparinux (Axistra)  
Rivaroxaban (Xerelto)  
Edoxaban (Lixiana, Savaysa)  
  
**Initial intervention:**Stop Apixaban immediately and document the last dose.  
Consider activated charcoal: For ingestion < 2 hours  
  
**Dose:** Liquid charcoal with sorbitol 50 g PO x 1 dose  
  
**Minor bleeding:  
**Consider hematology consult  
Investigate the etiology of bleed   
Mechanical compression   
  
**Stat labs:** CBC, renal and liver function, PT, aPTT, TT and anti-Xa assay if available  
Hematology consult  
Monitor the patient  
  
Consider 1 gram oral of Tranexamic acid for mucosal or superficial bleeding  
(maximum dose 25mg/kg) every 6-8 hours or IV 1gram (maximum dose 15mg/kg) every 6-8 hours. table.tableizer-table { font-size: 12px; border: 1px solid #CCC; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; } .tableizer-table td { padding: 4px; margin: 3px; border: 1px solid #CCC; } .tableizer-table th { background-color: #104E8B; color: #FFF; font-weight: bold; }

| Lab Test | Rivaroxaban |

| INR | ↑ (no correlation) |
| TT | No effect |
| ECT | No effect |
| Anti-Xa | ↑ ↑ most reliable |

**Moderate/Major bleeding:  
**Optimize tissue oxygenation  
Control Hemorrhage  
Mechanical compression  
Surgical intervention/endoscopy   
Fluid replacement and hemodynamic support  
Tranexamic acid 1gram IV stat (or15mg/kg)  
Desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg Sub Q or IV (limit to two doses due to tachyphylaxis)  
Transfuse PRBCs to maintain Hb >8 g/L  
Transfuse platelets to maintain Platelets >75k  
**If bleeding continues, consider:** Prothrombin Complex Concentrates (PCCs)  
**PCC Note:** PCC may partially correct PT/aPTT but will not affect anti-factor Xa activity and will not increase drug clearance; the correlation of shortening PT/aPTT with a reduction in bleeding risk is unknown.  
  
**Antidote for uncontrolled or life-threatening bleeding:  
****Andexanet alfa:** 400 mg IV bolus at 30 mg/min followed at 4 mcg/min for 120 minutes.  
  
**Other treatments for severe bleeding:  
**Initiate massive transfusion protocols.**PCCs-FEIBA 8 to 25 units/kg or Kcentra can be considered.  
**FFP: Not recommended  
rFVIIa: Not recommended  
  
**_PCC Warning:_** _Thrombotic and Thromboembolic events, including DIC, venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and stroke, have been reported after administering high doses.  
Patients need to be monitored following administration.  
_  
**Lab Monitoring with Apixaban:**  
**Anti-Xa assay:** This is the most reliable.  
**Normal anti-factor Xa assay:** Indicates no anticoagulation effect.
