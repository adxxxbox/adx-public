**Bacterial Meningitis and Arachnoiditis**

_Daniel D. Moose, CRNA_

Meningitis is a rare but lethal complication.  
It mimics a PDPH.  
**  
The incidence of meningitis:  
**Spinal anesthetics: 1:50,000  
Epidural anesthetics: 1:90,000  
  
**Why we wear a mask**  
It is essential that sterile technique is maintained during neuraxial blockade. A recent review article found that most cases of post neuraxial blockade bacterial meningitis are due to contamination of the puncture site by aerosolized mouth particles.  
  
**Causative Agents**  
Strains of viridans streptococcus, commonly found in the mouth, are the dominant causative agents resulting in post dural puncture meningitis. The anesthesia provider should wear a surgical mask, and change the mask between patients. To a lesser extent, meningitis can be caused by skin bacteria and from endogenous sites of infection.  
  
**Signs and Symptoms**  
May mimic a post dural puncture headache:  
Headache  
Neck pain  
Fever  
Alteration in the level of consciousness **Arachnoiditis**  
Arachnoiditis is a rare complication.  
It was more common in the past when there were no disposable trays.  
In the past, needles were cleaned with solutions that caused chemical meningitis and neurological dysfunction.  
  
**Chemical arachnoiditis -** can occur from inadvertent injection of steroids into the subarachnoid space.  
If performing epidural steroid injections and there is a question of possibly being in the subarachnoid space, stop the procedure and have the patient come back a week later. Lumbar arachnoiditis may occur following surgical procedures or trauma in the lumbar region.
