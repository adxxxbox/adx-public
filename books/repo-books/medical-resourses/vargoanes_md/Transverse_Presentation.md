### Transverse Presentation

**"Transverse Lie"** means a **sideways position.**  
  
The baby has his head to one of his mother's sides and the bottom across her abdomen at her other side.  
  
This is normal before 26 weeks, but by 29-30 weeks we expect babies to be head down, or at least **breech.  
  
**The doctor will try to manually turn the baby to head down, but a C-section is usually needed.
