### Spinal Distribution and Blockade per LA

**Spinals and Fast Onset**  
Spinals have a very fast onset because the nerves in the subarachnoid space lack a sheath, so the LAs are able to reach their targets more readily as compared to regional blocks elsewhere in the body  
  
The site of action includes the spinal nerve roots and dorsal root ganglion.  
  
Local anesthetics placed in the subarachnoid space will effectively block sensory, autonomic, and motor impulses by interacting with the anterior/posterior spinal nerve roots and the dorsal root ganglion as they pass through the CSF.  
  
The site of action includes the spinal nerve roots and dorsal root ganglion. Blockade of the anterior nerve root fibers results in blockade of efferent motor and autonomic transmission. Neural blockade of posterior nerve root fibers results in the blockade of somatic and visceral impulses. Spinal anesthesia is achieved with a small dose and volume of local anesthetic resulting in dense sensory and motor block. Uptake and elimination of local anesthetics is affected by the concentration of local anesthetic, surface area of neuronal tissue exposed, lipid content of neuronal tissue, and blood flow to the tissue. Concentration of local anesthetic is highest at the point of injection, and as the local anesthetic travels away from the site of injection it is diluted by CSF and absorbed into tissue.
