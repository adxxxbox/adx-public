### Cannulation (arterial, then venous)

**(Purse-String Suture:** is a continuous, circular inverting suture. When the cannula is inserted through this circle, the suture can be tightened around the cannula creating a seal).  
  
The Cannulation immediately follows opening the pericardium and securing it to the chest retractor.  
  
**Slowly decrease systolic BP below 100mmHg using nitroglycerine or isoflurane.**  
  
After the LIMA is separated from the chest wall, the pericardial sac is opened and secured. Pericardial stay sutures are placed to keep it open.  
  
Purse-string sutures are next placed at:

1.  Ascending Aorta, for aortic cannulation
2.  Right Atrial Appendage,for venous cannulation
3.  Anterior aspect of the ascending aorta, for antegrade cardioplegia and a venting cannula.

**By this time systolic BP should be just below 100mmHg.**

**Aortic cannulation is completed first**  
The tip of the arterial cannula is placed through the purse-strings on the ascending aorta. The pursed strings are tightened in order to ensure hemostasis around the cannulation site. Note: the cannula is sometimes clamped at this time. The arterial cannula is then unclamped to be de-aired, then quickly connected to the primed arterial line (tubing) of the CPB machine.  
  
**Venous Cannulation**  
A two stage venous cannula is then inserted through the purse-string on the right atrial appendage down into the inferior vena cava (IVC). The purse-strings are tightened, clamp comes off (if it is clamped), cannula is de-aired and connected to the venous line of the CPB machine.  
  
A “two staged” (cavo-atrial) cannula has a narrowed distal end. It is threaded into the IVC while the wider proximal portion has side holes designed to rest within the right atrium. It tends to be more stable and to provide better drainage than a single cannula.  
  
**Cardioplegia Cannula** (pencil thin with a sharp point): For antegrade cardioplegia and venting, it is placed through the purse-string on the anterior aspect of the ascending aorta. Retrograde cardioplegia cannulat is placed directly into the coronary sinus via the right atrial appendage.  
  
**Venting Cannula** is inserted in the right superior pulmonary vein.  
  
Now when all the cannulae are in, bypass is not taking place, and the anesthesia provider must correct any hypotension. If hypotension cannot be corrected by the anesthesia provider, the perfusionist may add some volume through the arterial line into the aorta (the CPB arterial tubing). Optimally, however, the anesthesia provider is responsible for correcting hypotension at this stage.  
  
Withdraw the PA catheter 2-5 cm within the sterile cathguard sheath before going on bypass. This decreases the chance of an over-wedging.
