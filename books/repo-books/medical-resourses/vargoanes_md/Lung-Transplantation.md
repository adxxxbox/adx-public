Lung Transplantation     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Lung Transplantation

The surgical removal of one or two diseased lungs followed by the placement of one or two donor lungs. Many times this is combined with a heart transplant. The donor organs must be placed within 4-8 hours after retrieval to avoid ischemic reperfusion damage.

**Common Indications**:COPD (emphysema or chronic bronchitis).  
Bronchiectasis  
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  
Cystic Fibrosis  
Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension  
Sarcoidosis

**Anesthetic**: General with a single lumen or DLT. Bronchial blockers are prone to intra-operative movements and malpositioning but they can also be used.  
**Induction:** RSI; use Etomidate for a low EF.  
**Nitrous Oxide:** Avoid  
**IV Access:** 2 large bore IVs  
**A-line:** Yes  
**Central Line:** Yes, float a Swan-Ganz line into the opposite lung if it’s a single lung transplant.

**Hydration**: Limit the fluids. Many patients need diuretics later.  
  
**Common Drips**  
Nitroglycerine, especially if pulmonary hypertension is involved.  
Neosynephrine

Norepinephrine or Epinephrine for heart/lung transplants.  
**  
Back-up Syringes**:  
Neosynephrine (diluted)  
Ephedrine (diluted)  
Esmolol  
Labetalol  
Hydralazine  
  
**TEE:** Yes  
**Position: see single or bilateral lung or heart/lung below.**  
**Single Lung:** Lateral or posterior lateral thoracotomy.  
**Bilateral Lungs:** Supine with arms above head with a transternal bilateral thoracotomy.  
**Heart/Lungs:** Supine, median sternotomy. Sometimes a bilateral anterior thoracotomy is performed.  
  
**CPB:**  
**Heart/Lung:** always  
Single and Bilateral lungs: Sometimes it is used; it’s also a back up if the patient can’t be adequately ventilated. There is more bleeding with bypass.  
**Ventilation**: 7-10 mL/kg tidal volume, RR 10-20, unless emphysema or air trapping pathology is present. You will need a slower rate with a prolonged expiratory time to prevent air trapping. Pressure Control **Ventilation** can limit high peak pressures to the non-transplanted lung and not challenge the new anastomotic sutures in the new lung.  
**FiO2:** Enough to keep the SaO2 > 96%.  
**Duration:**  
Single Lung: 2-4 hours  
Bilateral: 5-6 hours (they used to take 6-12 hours).  
Heart/Lung: 4-5 hours  
EBL:  
Single Lung: <500 mLs, more if CPB is used.  
Bilateral: 500-2,000 mLs.  
Heart/Lung: 500-2,000 mLs.  
**Emergence and Extubation:** NO, these cases always go to the ICU intubated.

**Possible Complications**:Surgical hemorrhage  
Rejection is the most common complication  
Infection  
Bronchiolitis obliterans Syndrome (BOS)  
Post-Transplant Diabetes  
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)

**Contraindications**:Some patients are just too sick or badly nourished to go through the procedure.

Patients who continue to smoke or abuse alcohol or other drugs.

Patients who have active hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV.

Patients who have had cancer within the past 2 years.

Patients who have lung disease that will likely affect the new lung.

Patients who have severe diseases of other organs.**  
  
Other Notes**:  
A PPO or Predicted Post-Operative FEV1 <40% of normal is associated with increased risk of respiratory complications.

The PPO FEV1 percentage is the most valid PFT value.

The standard Double Lumen Tubes or DLTs for transplantation can be associated with difficulty making the bronchial anastomosis, from copious thick secretions through the narrow lumens of a DLT, to the need to change the DLT to a single-lumen tube for postoperative ventilation. These problems led to combinations of bronchial blockers and single-lumen endotracheal tubes.

Right Ventricular Dysfunction is a common cause for hemodynamic decompensation leading to the necessity for CPB.

TEE is very useful to assess venous anastomoses but it is extremely difficult to assess left-sided pulmonary arterial anastomoses.

**Nitric Oxide (NO)**  
NO is useful to decrease elevated PA pressures and aid the failing RV. Due to better lung preservation, we are now transplanting lungs that would not have been used 10 years ago.
