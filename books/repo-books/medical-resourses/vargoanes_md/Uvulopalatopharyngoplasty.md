Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP)     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP)

The removal of excessive tissue from the throat to make the airway wider, reducing the severity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).

The tissue removed can be tonsils, adenoids and the soft palate. Many of these patients are obese and may have difficult airways. Most of these and other OSA surgical procedures are losing popularity because of their unsatisfactory success rates.  
  
Find out if the surgeon is going to use laser or electrocautery. Remember, if electrocautery is used, you will need to run with a low FIO2 for airway fire precautions.  
   
**Pre-op:** Carefully assess the airway for a possible Glide Scope intubation.  
**Indications:** OSA  
**Anesthetic:** General/Nasal Rae  
**Muscle Relaxant:** Not needed, but check with the surgeon.  
**Position:** Supine, arms tucked, shoulder roll. Sometimes the bed is rotated 90 degrees and HOB up 30 degrees.  
**Intubation:** Pre-oxygenate, RSI and Nasal Rae. Consider elective Glide Scope intubation. Have working Magill’s forceps ready. Spray bilateral nares with Neosynephrine nasal mist or Afrin spray.  
**Antisialogogue:** Yes; Robinul.  
**Steroids:** Decadron is indicated.  
**Throat pack:** yes. When the throat pack is removed, hand the surgeon an OGT to empty the stomach.  
**Antiemetics:** Zofran and Decadron are ok. But don’t give Decadron twice. See above.  
**Blood Pressure:** Keep the patient mildly hypotensive, but within 20% of their base to decrease bleeding. The mouth is vascular and we don’t want to contribute to bleeding by keeping a high BP.  
**EBL:** 50-100 ccs.  
**Emergence:** Smooth and avoid coughing. Consider awake extubation, depending on the intubation and other factors listed in the preceding section. Consider a Nasal airway.  
Humidified oxygen post op. The patient usually spends the night and is monitored for apneic episodes, airway edema, bleeding.

**Airway Fires:**  
If an airway fire occurs:  
1) Disconnect the circuit.  
2) Remove the ETT stat.  
3) If the fire continues, flood the field with saline. Direct examination with bronchoscopy  
    is indicated, followed by reintubation following assessment of damage.
