### Burns and Immune Response

Impaired immune function (sepsis, pneumonia, decreased organ perfusion)  
Endotoxemia  
Multiple organ system failure  
Leukocyte function is depressed  
Chemotaxis, phagocytosis, neutrophil proliferation, and humoral immunity are all weakened by impaired tissue perfusion pending burn magnitude.  
Gram negative bacteria is associated with an increase in mortality.

**Possible causes of sepsis**  
Pneumonia  
Infected eschar  
Suppurative thrombophlebitis (thrombosis associated with sepsis, CVLs, and impaired immunity)  
Iatrogenic / hospital acquired; strict aseptic technique and protective precautions are necessary

**Burn patients are prone to infection for several of reasons**  
The lack of epidermis and dermis leads to burn wound infection.  
An endotracheal tube or tracheostomy will act as a medium for pneumonia.  
Gut permeability to bacteria is also increased after a major burn; increases likelihood of translocation.  
IVs, central lines, and arterial lines provide a direct route for bacteria to enter the bloodstream.  
Generalized and local immune function is decreased by the burn injury.  
Thrombocytosis and hyperthermia are not unusual which do not help.  
Aseptic intravascular line insertion and maintenance are necessary.  
Respiratory care interventions are important in preventing infections.  
Decreased mobility, due to injury and / or suboptimal pain management.  
Liberal use of antibiotics
