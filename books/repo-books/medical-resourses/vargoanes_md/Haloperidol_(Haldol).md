### Haloperidol (Haldol)

**Brand and Other Names:** Haldol, Haldol Decanoate, Haloperidol LA, Peridol  
  
**Classes:** Antipsychotics, 1st generation  
  
Quick Synopsis of Haldol for anesthesia.  
Haldol is one of the antiemetic drugs now being administered by anesthesia providers for enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols.  
Common ERAS Doses for prophylactic nausea: 0.5-1.0 mg IV pre-induction.  
Vial: 5mg/ml in a 1 ml solution.  
  
**Indications for use by anesthesia providers:** Antiemetic for ERAS procedures.  
**Mechanism of antiemetic action:  
**Acts as a potent antiemetic, owing to its peripheral antidopaminergic effects on the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the brain. The drug can therefore be used to relieve nausea and sickness that occur as side effects of chemotherapy. The peripheral effects also lead to the relaxation of the gastric sphincter muscle.  
  
**General indications of haldol  
**For the management of psychotic disorders (eg. schizophrenia) and delirium, as well as to control tics and vocal utterances of Tourette's syndrome (Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome).  
Also used for the treatment of severe behavioral problems in children with disruptive behavior disorder or ADHD (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder).  
  
**Other label uses:**  
Treatment of intractable hiccups.  
Potent antiemetic.  
  
**Mechanism of action**  
Not known, but the drug appears to depress the CNS at the subcortical level of the brain, midbrain, and brain stem reticular formation.  
It appears to inhibit the ascending reticular activating system of the brain stem (possibly through the caudate nucleus), thereby interrupting the impulse between the diencephalon and the cortex.  
It may antagonize the actions of glutamic acid within the extrapyramidal system, and inhibitions of catecholamine receptors may also contribute to haloperidol's mechanism of action.  
It may also inhibit the reuptake of various neurotransmitters in the midbrain, and appears to have a strong central antidopaminergic and weak central anticholinergic activity.  
  
**Antidopaminergic drug**  
Haldol is an antidopaminergic drug and should not be used in patients with Parkinson disease, restless leg syndrome, or any other disorder in which dopaminergics are used to treat the signs and symptoms of the disease.  
Extrapyramidal reactions, sedation, diarrhea, and orthostatic hypotension can occur.  
  
Black Box Warning for Haldol  
Increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis  
  
Haldol is NOT approved for treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.  
  
Patients with dementia-related psychosis who are treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk for death.  
  
**Warnings regarding Haldol and Torsades de Pointes (TdP)**  
Documented caution with Haldol.  
Risk of sudden death, torsades de pointes, and prolonged QT interval from off-label IV administration of higher than recommended dose: monitor ECG if administering IV.  
  
Haldol is a butyrophenone (like droperidol) and can, like all antipsychotic medications, lengthen the QT interval.  
At least 2 dozen cases of TdP have been documented with intravenous haloperidol, but the overall risk appears to be VERY LOW as compared to other antipsychotic drugs.  
The risk even remains low in the presence of other potential risk factors (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, a prolonged QT interval at baseline, and the co-administration of other medications.  
  
**Note:** Droperidol has a “black box warning” for its association with Torsade de Pointes (TdP) but haldol DOES NOT.  
  
**Oral absorption:** 60%  
**Volume of distribution:** Unknown  
**Protein binding:** 92%  
**Half-life:** Variable, 12-35 hours.  
**Metabolism:** Hepatic  
  
_Haloperidol is metabolized by several routes, including the glucuronidation and the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Inhibition of these routes of metabolism by another drug may result in increased haloperidol concentrations and potentially increase the risk of certain adverse events, including QT prolongation._  
  
**Metabolites:** Metabolism consists of glucuronidation to an inactive metabolite (50-60%), reduction (and back oxidation) to reduced haloperidol (an active metabolite) (23%) and N-dealkylation to a pyridium metabolite (a toxic metabolite) (20-30%).  
  
**Excreted:** Only 1% is excreted unchanged in the urine.  
Reduced haloperidol is not detected after intravenous administration for even longer than after oral administration, which suggests that first-pass metabolism is responsible for increased reduced haloperidol concentrations.  
  
**Contraindications  
**Documented hypersensitivity.  
Severe CNS depression (including coma), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), poorly controlled seizure disorder, Parkinson disease.

**Cardiovascular Effects**  
Cases of sudden death, QT prolongation, and Torsades de Pointes have been reported in patients receiving Haldol. Higher than recommended doses of any formulation and intravenous administration of Haldol appear to be associated with a higher risk of QT prolongation and Torsades de Pointes.  
  
**Possible Adverse Effects:**  
Anticholinergic effects  
Sedation  
Weight gain  
Erectile dysfunction  
Oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea  
  
**Extrapyramidal symptoms:**  
Akathisia  
Dystonia  
Muscle stiffness  
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS; infrequent but serious)  
Parkinsonism  
Tardive dyskinesia  
  
**Less common**  
Orthostatic hypotension (after IM injection), tachycardia  
Falls  
  
Agitation, anxiety, cerebral edema, depression, dizziness, euphoria, headache, insomnia, poikilothermia, restlessness, weakness, confusion.  
  
Anorexia, constipation, dyspepsia, ileus, decreased gag reflex.  
Lens opacities (prolonged use).  
Leukopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis.  
  
**Other CNS Effects**  
Insomnia, restlessness, anxiety, euphoria, agitation, drowsiness, depression, lethargy, headache, confusion, vertigo, grand mal seizures, exacerbation of psychotic symptoms including hallucinations, and catatonic-like behavioral states which may be responsive to drug withdrawal and/or treatment with anticholinergic drugs.  
  
**More Notes**  
Since haloperidol is excreted in human breast milk, infants should not be nursed during drug treatment with haloperidol.  
  
Haloperidol prevents the effects of dopamine in the nigrostriatal pathways, which probably explains the associated side effects such as akathisia and dystonias. However, the agent only has mild antihistaminic and anticholinergic properties, meaning side effects such as hypotension, constipation and dry mouth occur less frequently than when neuroleptics such as chlorpromazine are used.  
  
An anti-psychotic medicine, haloperidol is used to treat mental and mood disorders, including schizophrenia and acute psychosis.  
It can also help to reduce hallucinations, as well as to treat uncontrolled outbursts related to Tourette's disorder, and it can be used for short periods of time for people who have acute agitation.  
  
In children, Haldol may be used for severe behavior problems including hyperactivity or aggression.  
  
Haloperidol was developed by a Belgian company in 1958, and approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1967. McNeil Laboratories marketed the drug under the brand name Haldol. The tablet forms are now available only generically.
