### Irreversible Brain Damage from Mismanaged Fetal Distress

Any complication during labor may cause oxygen deprivation in the fetus may result in cerebral palsy, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) and intellectual and developmental disabilities.  
  
Asphyxia by definition involves both hypoxia and hypercapnia with metabolic acidosis.  
Many studies suggest that the periods of hypotension during severe asphyxia is associated with decreased brain perfusion that leads to the brain damage.  
  
Unfortunately, it is difficult to tell exactly how long the fetus can tolerate asphyxia without brain damage due to the variations of asphyxia and compensatory mechanisms involved.  
  
When facing the onset of severe fetal distress, nobody really knows how much time you really have to get the baby out before there is irreversible brain damage. We normally just get to surgery and get the baby out ASAP.  
  
Always have emergency intubation equipment (even a Glide scope) and meds available.

We can safely assume that there are many times that irreversible brain damage occurred in just a matter of seconds to minutes past that the minimal threshold. We just don’t know. If we make the wrong decision that may have prolonged an Emergency C-section for just for 1 minute, it may show up in court. These lawyers will keep questioning - What If?  
  
With severe fetal distress with an existing epidural, we usually still immediately intubate the patient. GETA is usually the quickest and safest route to take. Intubation to delivery can be as quick as 2 minutes!  
  
It takes time to draw up a local anesthetic, bolus the epidural and administer Bicritra, Pepcid and Reglan.  
  
We need to remember that the L&D department documents fetal distress (as they should) and I have personally seen OB docs pass the buck to anesthesia after a terrible outcome!  
  
If you mismanage fetal distress by losing minutes while waiting for a block set up etc, you may end up in court for "Mismanaged Fetal Distress."
