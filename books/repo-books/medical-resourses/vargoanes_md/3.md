### Preoperative Orders

All patients must receive antianginal medications with a sip of water a few hours prior to surgery.  
  
Pre-op orders must clearly specify pre-op medications. Patients whose antianginal medications are withheld may experience withdrawal effects, which can increase the incidence of surgical complications.  
  
All cardiac medications should be continued on the day of surgery EXCEPT ACE INHIBITORS. They should be stopped 24 hours prior to surgery.  
  
**Anticoagulants**  
IV heparin: In the past, IV heparin infusions were discontinued. The American Heart Association now recommends against discontinuing the infusion. The slight increase in surgical bleeding is preferable to development of a thrombus.  
  
**Coumadin:** Discontinue 4-5 days before surgery.  
  
**ASA/NSAIDS/Triclopidine:** Ideally should be discontinued 7-10 days before surgery.  
  
**Glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa Inhibitor abciximab (ReoPro):** Delay CABG for 12 hours or give platelets during surgery.  
  
**(GP) IIb/IIIa Inhibitors-Integrilin and tirofiban:** Administration may be delayed in the case of emergency CABG. .  
  
If elective CABG, delay 2-4 hours.  
  
**Steroids or Anti-rejection drugs:** continue
