# Cardizem

**Cardizem (Diltiazem)**  
**Anesthesia:** Increases effects and may slower emergence.  
**Class:** Calcium Channel Blocker  
**Subclass:** Benzothiazepine  
**Indications:** control rapid ventricular response from Afib/flutter  
PSVT  
Hypertension  
Harvesting radial artery grafts-CABG (arterial spasm).  
Angina (usually PO)  
Should only be used if the ventricular rate is over 100.  
**Doses:**  
Standard Drip rate: 5-15 mg/hr.  
Titrate: 5mg/hr increments according to HR  
**Rapid A Fib/Flutter**  
20mg (0.35mg/kg) bolus over 2 minutes.  
If no conversion: 25mg (0.35mg/kg) may be given 15 minutes after the initial dose.  
If continued reduction in ventricular rate is required, initiate infusion at 10mg/hr.  
Infusion rate may be increased by increments of 5mg/hr up to 15mg/hr.  
Maximum is 15mg/hr.  
**PSVT:**  
20mg (0.25-mg/kg) dose given over 2 minutes (slow push), If no conversion to normal sinus rhythm then give 25mg (0.35mg/kg) may be given 15 minutes after the initial dose.  
**Pediatric Dosage:** Rarely used.  
**Action:**  
Slows conduction thru SA and AV node. Decreases rate of ventricular response. Coronary vasodilation. Peripheral vasodilation (decreases systolic/diastolic BP). Decreases myocardial oxygen consumption secondary to below: Decreased peripheral resistance (decreases afterload).> Decreases heart rate (negative Chronotrope).  
**Standard Concentration:** 1mg/mL  
**Precautions:** Should NOT be used in patients receiving IV Beta blockers.  
**Contraindications:**  
Allergic to Cardizem  
Sick Sinus Syndrome  
WPW  
2nd or 3rd degree AV block  
Hypotension  
  
Wide complex tachycardia  
Atrioventricular node conduction disturbances.  
Bradycardia  
Impaired left ventricle function  
Peripheral artery occlusive disease  
COPD  
Prinzmetal's angina  
Wide complex tachycardia  
**Adverse and Side Effects**  
AV Block with post-op patients-especially valves May increase digoxin levels  
Nausea  
Vomiting  
Hypotension  
Dizziness  
Itching or burning at injection site  
Vasodilation  
Flushing  
Hypotension  
Swelling and/or edema  
Headache  
Dizziness  
Muscle weakness  
**Other Notes**  
Mostly seen in ICUs to reduce the heart rate in A-fib and flutter. Uncontrolled atrial fib/flutter is defined as a having a rate over 100.  
The initial goal- is to reduce the heart rate to less than 100.  
Occasionally, you will see a conversion to sinus rhythm with Cardizem alone.  
Cardizem can be safely administered to patients with marginal blood pressures if given slowly.  
It still can lower the BP, so if your patient is on any dilators-you may want to lower their doses.  
  
Must be kept refrigerated or discarded one month after removal from refrigeration.
