### Robotic Procedures and Anesthesia Notes (abdominal)

General/ETT

Eye goggles (face protection from robotic arms)

Foam donut or cradle (over the patient's face) to protect the patient's face from robotic arms.

The patient’s arms will be tightly tucked with minimal access once the patient is positioned and secured.

**Due to minimal access to the patient’s arms, anesthesia providers often do the following:**

2 IVs (in case one fails)

2 BP cuffs (one on each arm) in case one fails.

**If the patient is in steep Trendelenburg:**

Gynecological, prostate, colorectal, and urological surgical procedures often require that patients be placed in a steep Trendelenburg position.

**The patient lies face up with their head and body tilted 25–45° down.**

**This position keeps abdominal organs away from the surgical site and reduces blood loss.**

Observe the patient’s head closely with positioning to ensure the patient is not sliding off the bed.

Soft foam or egg crates should be fixed to the surgical table and placed directly under the patient to prevent slipping during the steep Trendelenburg.

The arms are tucked at the sides with adequate padding to minimize injuries along pressure points.

A padded strap is secured across the patient’s chest to prevent lateral movement.

  

Consider an oral gastric tube if the patients will be in steep Trendelenburg.

Consider pressure control ventilation or lower tidal volumes with a higher respiratory rate.

Periodically lift the drape to visualize the patient’s face for the presence of oral gastric juice/drainage.

**Bed control:** Once the bed is positioned and the robot is docked to the patient, DO NOT change the bed position until it is undocked from the patient.

**BP control:**

Hypotension is rare when the patient is in Trendelenburg.

Avoid hypotension, as it will increase the chances of a stroke.

**Hypotension while in steep Trendelenburg.**

Prolonged hypotension in steep Trendelenburg will dramatically increase the risk of stroke due to a drastic decrease in **Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP).**

**Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP)**

MAP-ICP (or CVP) = CPP

Normal CPP = 70-110mmHg

CPP < 50mmHg = slowing of the EEG

CPP 25-40mmHg = flat EEG

CPP < 25 mmHg = irreversible brain damage

  

In steep Trendelenburg, the CVP or ICP is drastically elevated, resulting in a decreased CPP.

It becomes obvious here not to permit a low MAP.

**Prolonged procedures may result in temporary conjunctival swelling via gravity.**

Inform the PACU nurses of possible corneal abrasions caused by patients' increased urge to scratch their eyes for conjunctival irritation.
