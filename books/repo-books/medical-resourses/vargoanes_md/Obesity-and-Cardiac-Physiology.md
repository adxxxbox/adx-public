### Obesity and Cardiac Physiology

Obesity affects many systems, but the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems are most relevant to cardiac physiology. Obesity is known increase the risk of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction and sudden death.  
  
Obesity is also associated with HTN, but no causal relationship has been found.  
  
Blood volume and cardiac output in the obese are abnormally high because there is more tissue to perfuse.  
Cardiac index is normal or slightly increased. Increased CO, hypertension and blood volume tend to lead to increased LVEDV and increased LVEDP, increased PCWP, and decreased LV compliance.  
  
Obese individuals will over time display increased pulmonary volume and pulmonary vascular resistance. This may progress eccentric myocardial hypertrophy, CHF and either right or left heart failure Biventricular failure may eventually develop.  
  
Right ventricular failure results from pulmonary vascular changes and decreased tissue oxygenation. In hypoventilated and hypoxic lung units, vascular resistance increases in an effort to shunt pulmonary circulation to better ventilated lung units. This compensatory mechanism to reduce venous admixture is referred to as hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, or HPV.  
  
As HPV progresses, pulmonary vascular pressure increases and eventually this results in pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. Left heart failure may accompany these changes.  
  
There is a 10-30x incidence of ventricular ectopy in the obese compared to the non-obese patient. This may explain the increased incidence among the obese of sudden death.
