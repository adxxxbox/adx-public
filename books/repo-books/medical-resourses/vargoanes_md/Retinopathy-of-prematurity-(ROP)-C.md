**Anesthesia specific concerns:**  
Avoid high concentrations of O2 on NICU patients.  
Avoid high concentrations of O2 on newborns (just to be safe).

Most neonatologist request all premature and newborn patients on the lowest FIO2 as possible. Preferably < 30%.  
Try to keep Sa02 90-94%

No Nitrous Oxide if gas bubble placed during vitrectomy.

Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) use to be called Retrolental fibroplasia.

ROP is a proliferation of disorganized, abnormal blood vessels in the retinal tissue of the eye. ROP can lead to blindness due to abnormal blood vessels exhibiting fragility and rupture or leak. This leads to scarring on the retina and eventually a retinal detachment.

**Pathophysiology:** The retina begins to develop during the fourth month of pregnancy. When a baby is born extremely premature the retina has not fully developed. The retinal vasculature is highly sensitive to oxygen and is therefore affected by the hyperoxia or hypoxia. Development of the disease process is not fully understood, but seems to be multifactorial. Exposure to bright light, with increased or decreased arterial oxygen tension seem to play a role in the pathogenesis of the retina.

**Incidence:** Upwards of 50% in the micropremie (ELBW, 1000 grams) population and the incidence increases as the birth weight and gestational age decrease. Patients most at risk are born at or less than 31 week and with a birth weight of less than 1250 grams.

**Stages (according to the National Eye Institute):**

**Stage I** — Mildly abnormal blood vessel growth. This usually requires no treatment, and spontaneously resolves on it’s own.

**Stage II** — Moderately abnormal blood vessel growth. Many children who develop stage II improve with no treatment and eventually develop normal vision.

**Stage III** — Severely abnormal blood vessel growth. The abnormal blood vessels grow toward the center of the eye instead of following their normal growth pattern along the surface of the retina. Some infants who develop stage III improve with no treatment and eventually develop normal vision. However, when infants have a certain degree of Stage III and “plus disease” develops, treatment is considered. “Plus disease” means that the blood vessels of the retina have become enlarged and twisted, indicating a worsening of the disease. Treatment at this point, aids in the prevention of retinal detachment.

**Plus disease** -Significant level of vascular dilation and tortuosity observed at the posterior retinal arterioles. This reflects the increase of blood flow through the retina which leads to àVitreous haze, anterior chamber haze, iris vascular engorgement and persistent tunica vasculosa lentis (immature blood vessels growing over the lens which also restrict the dilatation of the pupils).

**Stage IV** — Partially detached retina. Bleeding produces traction on the scar, then abnormal vessels pulls the retina away from the wall of the eye.

**Stage V “End Stage”** — Completely detached retina. If the eye is left alone at this stage, the baby can have severe visual impairment and even blindness.

**Procedures/Treatment:** Patient’s with ROP will undergo multiple anesthetics for exams of the eye under anesthesia and if severe enough will undergo treatment for the condition. Stages I-III will often resolve with no treatment and no further complications. Stage III with “plus disease” is considered “threshold disease” and is the threshold at which 50% of patients will develop a retinal detachment without interventions. Interventions consist of

**Laser photocoagulation or cryotherapy** - aim to destroy the abnormal tissue which can cause the retinal detachment. Laser treatment is the preferred option when available.

**Vitrectomy** - removal of all or part of the vitreous humor and injection of a gas bubble to promote retinal reattachment

**Scleral buckle placement** -silicone band placed around the eye to hold the retina in place. The band must be removed months or years later as the infant’s eye continues to grow.

**Oral propranolol**
