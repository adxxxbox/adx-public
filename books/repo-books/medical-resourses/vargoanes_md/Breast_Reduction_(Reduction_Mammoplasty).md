Breast Reduction (reduction mammoplasty)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Breast Reduction (reduction mammoplasty)

Removal of excess breast fat, glandular tissue and skin, to achieve a breast size in proportion with the body, and to alleviate the discomfort associated with overly large breasts.  
  
The surgeon makes an incision around the areola-nipple complex, then downward on the breast in the form of a keyhole. He then removes extra skin, tissue, and fat from the breasts and repositions the areola-nipple complex. Drainage tubes are placed, and a post-op support bra applied following closure.  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT. LMA may be used, however, procedure length may preclude its use.  
**Duration:** 2-5 hours.  
**Position:** Supine, arms abducted and wrapped securely to the arm boards. The operating table is placed in the sitting position at time during the procedure, so securing the arms is an important consideration.  
**Indications:** Neck and back pain resulting from excessive breast size are medical indications.  
Breast hypertrophy (macromastia and gigantomastia).  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
  
Patients are usually satisfied with the outcome. Males with gynecomastia are also candidates for the procedure.  
  
**Contraindications:**  
Lactating women who have recently ceased lactating.  
Unevaluated tissue masses.
