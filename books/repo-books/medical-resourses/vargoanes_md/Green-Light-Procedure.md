### Green Light Procedure

An alternative for the TURP procedure that has fewer side effects.  
Instead of using a cutting loop with a resectoscope through the urethra to trim away excess prostate tissue (TURP), the Green Light procedure uses a laser.   
**Indications:** Benign BPH. Always ask the surgeon if the patient needs muscle relaxation due to the possible stimulation of the obturator nerve (see note below).  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT with relaxation or spinal.  
Most surgeons will demand complete relaxation because unexpected movement could cause perforation while using the laser within the urethra.  
If a Spinal or epidural: T10 level.  
**Position:** Lithotomy   
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes  
**B &O suppository:** Sometimes to prevent bladder spasms.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
**Foley:** Yes  
**EBL:** None  
**More Notes**  
Basically, the TURP procedure has been the golden standard for benign BPH. It has been around a very long time. The Green Light procedure has only been around for 10 years so it lacks long-term results.   
 

**Advantages of the Green Light Procedure over the TURP**  
No blood loss. Patients can remain on blood thinners such as Warfarin, Plavix and ASA. This is an issue with the TURP patient who has cardiac stents and is on coagulants.   
The Foley catheter is removed much quicker and most patients go home the same day. The Green Light procedure is also an outpatient procedure and more cost effective.  
  
The patient can return to normal, non-strenuous activities within days. Less than 1% of patient will experience erectile dysfunction. Only 1/3 of the patients have retrograde ejaculation after the procedure.  
 

**Obturator nerve:** The obturator nerve passes in close proximity to the inferolateral bladder wall, bladder neck and lateral prostatic urethra.  During a transurethral operation, resection in these areas may result in stimulation of the obturator nerve, causing violent adductor contraction and possible inadvertent perforation. This is NOT because your patient was light! This is why many surgeons demand muscle relaxation or a spinal for many TURPS or simple bladder procedures that otherwise look like they just require an LMA.
