### Quick List of Procedures During Bypass.

Discontinue ventilation (Make sure APL valve is open. The breathing bag may be removed).  
  
Turn vent and monitor to CPB mode, apply PEEP 5 cm.  
Decrease O2 flow to 0.5-1 lpm.  
  
Turn Isoflurane off.  
  
Stop (KVO) all drips except Insulin, Amicar and HCO3.  
  
Re-dose paralytic agent and benzodiazepine.  
  
CO measurements are not accurate during cardiopulmonary bypass.  
  
During cardiopulmonary bypass, the perfusionist will obtain specimen for ACT and ABG.  
  
Cerebral function monitor reading will decrease profoundly with blood cooling, If processed EEG index increases, advise perfusionist to increase isoflurane concentration.  
  
Check again to ensure adequate withdrawal of PA catheter.  
Check for facial or neck swelling. No swelling ensures properly positioned cannula.
