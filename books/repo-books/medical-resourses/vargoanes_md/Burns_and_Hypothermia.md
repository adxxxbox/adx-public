### Burns and Hypothermia

Burn patients are at great risk of hypothermia because of the lost skin, which actually acts as a barrier to heat loss.

Hypothermia may exacerbate the hypermetabolic response in burn patients.

Maintaining **ambient** temperatures between 28°C and 33°C increases patient survival due to a reduction in metabolic rate and muscle and protein catabolism.  

Heat conserving strategies:  
Underbody warming blanket  
Covering the patient with plastic or forced-air blankets  
Fluid warmer  
Warm the room up  
Head cap (some literature supports the use of head coverings while in OR; reflective if available)

Core temperature may be continuously monitored through a bladder catheter, rectal temperature probe or esophageal probe.

Hypothermia will impair wound healing, contribute to rejection of skin grafts, and increase the likelihood of wound infection.

Normothermia to these patients may be 38 to 39 degrees Celsius rather than 37. A preoperative room temperature drop can have significant consequences in terms of post op shivering (shivering is associated with increased oxygen demand, increased caloric expenditure, tissue perfusion abnormalities).

This is why the burn rooms are so hot.

Radiation 60%  
Evaporation 25%  
Convection 12%  
Conduction 3%
