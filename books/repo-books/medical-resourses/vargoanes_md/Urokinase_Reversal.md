Urokinase (Abbokinase, kinlytic, Abbokinase) reversal    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Urokinase (Abbokinase, kinlytic) reversal

_Currently, there is a lack of specific antidotes for the growing number of new (novel) anticoagulants that are slowly replacing warfarin and heparin. For this reason, there is NO universal standard of care for the treatment of the anticoagulated bleeding patient when there is no specific antidote._

**Consult cardiology for ALL patients with coronary stents.**

**Quick Notes**  
_Newer drugs with a shorter half-life are usually preferred over urokinase.  
Primarily indicated only for patients allergic to streptokinase._ Urokinase administered by intravenous infusion is rapidly cleared by the liver with an **elimination half-life** of 12.6 ± 6.2 minutes.  
  
**Laboratory monitoring  
Thrombin time (TT):** a systemic administration, a 3 to 5 fold 4 hours after initiation of therapy is generally considered sufficient.  
However, results of coagulation tests and fibrinolytic activity do not reliably predict either efficacy or risk of bleeding.  
  
Plasma fibrinogen may be useful.  
Bleeding time and fibrin/fibrin degradation product (FDP/fdp) titer.  
May increase PT, PTT, and INR.  
May decrease hematocrit.  
  
**Initial treatment:** Discontinue infusion or find out when infusion was discontinued.  
  
**Consider lab tests:** CBC and plasma fibrinogen.**  
  
Mild bleed:  
**Apply mechanical compression.  
  
**Antidote:** Amicar or tranexamic acid may be considered as an antidote.  
**Recommended Amicar dose:** 5 gm IV over 1 hr, then 1 gm/hr infusion.  
  
_Older literature from 2013 has listed Amicar as very rapid reversal of the fibrinolytic state is required for TPAs._ Tranexamic Acid appears to be more popular now.  
(ANTICOAGULANT, THROMBOLYTIC, and ANTI-PLATELET DRUGS Katzung (9th ed.) Chapter 34)  
  
**Without Amicar or tranexamic acid:**  
Immediate infusions of equivalent of 6-8 units of platelets (or one platelet pheresis product),  
2 units of FFP, and 10 units of cryoprecipitate.  
  
**Severe blood loss:**  
Administration of packed red blood cells is preferred to whole blood.  
Alternatives include fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate.
