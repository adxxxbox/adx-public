### Liver Failure Organ System Notes

**CNS**:  
Up to 80% of patients with acute liver failure develop cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure. Encephalopathy found in chronic liver disease may have a common underlying pathophysiology with the cerebral edema of acute liver failure. Lack of hepatic clearance severely elevates levels of ammonia and magnesium. There are changes in endogenous transmitters and cellular messengers, including GABA, glutamate, and nitric oxide.

The enzymes of the urea cycle are absent in the brain. The resulting accumulation of glutamine, an osmotic compound, targets the glial astrocytes and results in cerebral edema in acute liver failure.  
  
**Cardiac**:Up to 70% of patients with end-stage liver disease develop a HYPERdynamic state from increases cardiac output and arteriolar vasodilatation. The reason for this is the diseased liver is not metabolizing vasoactive substances. Nitric oxide and cGMP are believed to be the culprits. Some believe that toxic substances released from the necrotic liver may be the cause.  
Cardiomyopathy has been associated with alcoholic cirrhosis and hemochromatosis. EKG disturbances may result from electrolyte or acid–base abnormalities. CAD is associated with a high mortality rate with transplants. This is why screening is important.

**Pulmonary**:Arterial hypoxemia

An increase in interstitial lung water from hypo-albuminemia and hyponatremia contributes to altered O2 diffusion. The presence of ascites and pleural effusions produces atelectasis and restrictive pulmonary disorders. To further complicate the picture, many cirrhotic patients have chronic bronchitis and emphysema resulting from tobacco abuse. The restrictive lung disease from ascites or pleural effusions frequently responds to fluid removal.

  
Intrapulmonary shunts-V/Q mismatch  
Porto-pulmonary hypertension (PPH) - is present in 2% of patients with chronic liver disease. The outcome of transplantation in patients with severe PPH is poor. A liver transplantation patient with a mean PAP > 35mmHg and PVR > 250 is associated with an increased perioperative mortality caused by right heart failure or hepatic failure.

Hypoxemia without ascites or intrinsic lung disease is referred to as Hepato-Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS). HPS resolves after liver transplantation. The persistence of hypoxemia with 100% oxygen administration contraindicates transplantation in patients with this syndrome.

**Renal**:  
Cirrhotic and jaundiced patients are at high risk for secondary postoperative oliguric renal failure. The natural route for excretion of bile is the biliary tract, but when the biliary tract is occluded, the renal system becomes the main excretory pathway. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is stimulated, and as the liver disease progresses, an increase in ADH results in an impairment of free water excretion and dilutional hyponatremia. In advanced stages of cirrhosis, intense renal vasoconstriction decreases glomerular filtration. Endothelins are blood proteins that constrict blood vessels and raise blood pressure. They may be responsible for afferent arteriolar constriction, whereas the increased Nitric Oxide levels decrease the efferent arteriolar tone, further decreasing GFR.  
  
**Hepato-Renal Syndrome (HRS):** Is a functional cause of renal failure and is common in patients with end stage liver disease. Current treatment of HRS involves using vasoconstrictors to reverse splanchnic vasodilatation. Terlipressin, a vasopressin analog, has been shown to decrease serum creatinine, increase mean arterial pressure, and reverse the stimulation of renin.

**GI**:  
Esophageal varices.  
Portal hypertension.  
Ascites.  
Gastric emptying is delayed.  
  
Hematological and Clotting Factors:  
Anemia is a result of chronic disease, malnutrition, or bleeding.**  
  
Coagulopathy can be from**:  
Quantitative and qualitative platelet defects.  
Decreased synthesis of clotting factors and their inhibitors.  
Vitamin K deficiency.  
Decreased synthesis of abnormal clotting factors.  
Decreased clearance of activated factors.  
Hyperfibrinolysis.  
DIC  
Splenic sequestration of platelets, contributing to thrombocytopenia.  
Sepsis from bone marrow suppression or DIC also may lead to low platelet counts.

All clotting factors except von Willebrand factor are synthesized in the liver. As a result, liver failure patients have low levels of all factors except fibrinogen.

Decreasing levels of fibrinogen and factor VIII suggest the presence of primary fibrinolysis or DIC. The use of anti-fibrinolytics, common during a liver transplantation, is contraindicated in patients with DIC.
