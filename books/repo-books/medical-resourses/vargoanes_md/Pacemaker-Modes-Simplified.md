### Pacemaker Modes Simplified

**1st letter** \= Area paced  
**2nd letter**\= Area sensed  
**3rd letter**\= what the pacemaker does with the sensing information

**3rd letter can be tricky.  
“O” means -** “No” Inhibitions with sensing. This means if the pacemaker senses electrical activity, it will still pace regardless; it’s not inhibited. Restated, the pacer will pace if it senses anything or not. A bovie will not interrupt it.  
**“I” means –**“Inhibited,” meaning it will NOT pace if it senses any electrical activity. The EMI from a bovie can be sensed as an impulse from the heart and it will stop pacing. 

**Example: AOO means the pacemaker is** continuously paced at a given rate no matter what. 

**_AOO_**  
Atrium is Paced  
Nothing is sensed  
No inhibitions

**Indications for AOO:**  
Sick sinus syndrome with intact conduction.  
When a bovie compromises a pacemaker.  
Bradycardia from narcotics (usually a very temporary situation).

**_AAI_**  
Atrial pace  
Atrial sensed  
Inhibited by Atrium  
**Indications for AAI:** Sick sinus syndrome with intact conduction system. This means the pacemaker will NOT pace when it senses an adequate atrial rate.  
  
**_VOO_**  
Ventricular paced  
Nothing is sensed  
No inhibitions  
**Indications:** Third degree heart block  
In OR with atrial fibrillation. Why atrial fibrillation?  Because you can’t effectively pace the ATRIUM if it is fibrillating. So we pace the ventricle.  
  
**_VVI_**  
Ventricular paced  
Ventricular sensed  
Ventricular inhibited  
**Indications:** 3rd degree heart block with atrial fib.

**_DOO_**  
Dual paced (both atrium and ventricle)  
Nothing sensed  
No Inhibitions  
**Indications:** Third degree heart block in OR with a bovie.  
  
**What is _DOO 99_?**  
EP nurses tell us that when you place a magnet on a pacemaker, it only goes into DOO for 99 seconds. So you have 99 seconds to get an external pacer set up if it’s true.  
  
**_DVI_**  
Dual paced  
Ventricular sensed  
Ventricular inhibited  
**Indications:** Third degree heart block with supraventricular tachycardias.

**_DDD_**  
Dual Paced  
Dual sensed  
**Dual Inhibited-** this pacemaker can be INHIBITED by electrical activity from an atrial contraction and it will not pace the atrium. Or, it can be INHIBITED by the electrical activity of a ventricular contraction, and not pace the ventricle, or both.   
  
**DDD-** Atrium and ventricle can both be paced; atrium and ventricle both sensed; pacing triggered in each chamber if beat not sensed.  
**Indications:**  3rd degree heart block.
