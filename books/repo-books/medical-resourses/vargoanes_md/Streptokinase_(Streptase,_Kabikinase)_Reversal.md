Streptokinase (Streptase, Kabikinase) reversal    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Streptokinase (Streptase, Kabikinase) Reversal

_Currently, there is a lack of specific antidotes for the growing number of new (novel) anticoagulants that are slowly replacing warfarin and heparin. For this reason, there is NO universal standard of care for the treatment of the anticoagulated bleeding patient when there is no specific antidote._

**Consult cardiology for ALL patients with coronary stents.**

**Quick Notes  
After streptokinase is discontinued:**  
The hyperfibrinolytic effect disappears within a few hours.  
Thrombolytic therapy will maximally depress fibrinogen and plasminogen for 5 hours.  
A prolonged thrombin time may persist for up to 24 hours due to the decrease in plasma levels of fibrinogen and an increase in the amount of circulating fibrinogen.  
  
**The fibrinogen reference range for the different fibrinogen tests are as follows:** Fibrinogen antigen: 149-353 mg/dL.  
Fibrinogen: 150-400 mg/dLFibrinogen antigen/functional ratio: 0.59-1.23.  
  
**Specific Antidote: none  
Antagonists:** aprotinin is documented, but no longer available in US.**Specific Antidote:** none  
Amicar or tranexamic acid are options for reversal of thrombolytic therapy.  
  
**Recommended Amicar dose:** 5 gm IV over 1 hr, then 1 gm/hr infusion.  
**Monitor:** plasma fibrinogen may be useful.  
Bleeding time and fibrin/fibrin degradation product (FDP/fdp) titer.  
May increase PT, PTT, and INR.  
May decrease hematocrit.  
  
**Initial Treatment**  
Discontinue streptokinase infusion or determine time infusion was stopped.  
**Consider routine lab tests:** Plasma fibrinogen and CBC.  
  
**Mild Bleed:**  
Apply mechanical compression.  
  
**Without Amicar or tranexamic acid:**  
If warranted: immediate infusions of equivalent of 6-8 units of platelets (or one platelet pheresis product),  
2 units of FFP, and 10 units of cryoprecipitate.  
  
**Severe Blood Loss**  
Administration of more PRBCs, FFP and cryoprecipitate.  
  
**Life-threatening bleed**  
Initiate massive transfusion protocols.  
FEIBA 8 to 25 units/kg or Kcentra can be considered.
