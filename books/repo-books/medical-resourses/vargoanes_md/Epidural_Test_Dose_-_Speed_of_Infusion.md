### Epidural Test Dose - Speed of Infusion

**All test doses should be rapidly infused  
**The speed of injection may affect the reliability of the epidural test dose.  
  
An epinephrine-containing test dose should be injected rapidly.  
  
Slow administration may cause the drugs (both epinephrine and local anesthetic) to undergo redistribution and metabolism before a sufficient amount could bind to receptors.
