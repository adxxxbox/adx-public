### Cerebral Aneurysm Coiling

**Coil Embolization or Endovascular Coiling**  
(Endovascular Brain Aneurysm Repair)  
  
We ALWAYS prefer these endovascular coiling procedures over any open craniotomy!  
**Location:** In Radiology/Specials or a Hybrid room.  
  
**Procedure:****  
Two approaches are currently used to repair a cerebral aneurysm:  
**1\. A craniotomy involving the surgical clipping of the aneurysm’s neck.  
2\. A minimal invasive endovascular coiling.  
  
**Coiling may be an effective treatment for the following:**  
**Ruptured aneurysms:** Burst open and release blood causing a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).  
The risk of repeated bleeding is 35% within the first 14 days after the first bleed  
So timing of treatment is important - usually within 72 hours of the first bleed.  
Vasospasm is a common complication of SAH.  
  
**Unruptured aneurysms:**  
May not cause symptoms and are typically detected during routine testing for another condition.  
The risk of aneurysm rupture is about 1% per year but may be higher or lower depending on the size and location of the aneurysm.  
However, when rupture occurs, the risk of death is 40%, and the risk of disability is 80%.  
  
In contrast to a craniotomy, endovascular coiling does not require open surgery.  
The neuro interventionalist uses fluoroscopy to visualize the patient's aneurysm and treat it from inside the blood vessel. This involves the insertion of a catheter into the femoral artery in the patient's groin and navigating it through the vascular system, into the head and aneurysm.  
The coils most commonly used for occlusion of aneurysms are detachable or retrievable coils.  
  
These tiny platinum coils are threaded through the catheter and deployed into the aneurysm, blocking blood flow into the aneurysm and preventing rupture.  
The coils are made of platinum so that they can be visible via X-ray and be flexible enough to conform to the aneurysm shape.  
This endovascular coiling, or filling, of the aneurysm is called embolization.  
The fluoroscopic images of the coiling appear like a ball of yarn that fills the pouch of the aneurysm.  
  
The results, including long term follow up, indicate that coiling is a very reasonable treatment option for patients with suitable aneurysms.  
  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
**Induction:** Avoid BP spikes.  
**Esmolol:** Optional: consider giving 100-150mg 2 minutes before laryngoscopy to prevent transient tachycardia and HTN.  
**Relaxation:** Yes, the surgeon or interventional radiologist will want zero movement.  
**A-line:** Yes, for ACTs and incase the aneurysm ruptures.  
**Heparinize:** yes, titrate with ACTs.  
**ACTs:** Yes and get a baseline sample prior to heparinization.  
**Central Line:** Not needed.  
**IV Access:** 1-2  
**Hydration:** Be careful how much volume you give. The patient is also receiving IV volume from the crew doing the procedure-usually a liter.  
**Position:** Supine, arms tucked.  
**Duration:** 2-5 hours, could be longer.  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**Heparinize:** Yes; see above.  
**BP:** Usually near the baseline. Ask the interventional radiologist or surgeon what the target BP is before the case starts.  
**Foley:** Yes.  
**Neosynephrine Drip:** Yes; titrate to effect.  
**Lead Apron:** Yes, try and get a comfortable apron since the case may be very long in duration.  
  
**Possible complications  
Thromboembolism:** Clots can form inside the guiding catheter, on the coils and stents, or in the parent vessels.  
Clots can break loose and travel downstream to block a smaller artery, potentially causing a stroke. Blood clots occur in 8% of cases, but stroke only occurs in 3%.  
Giving heparin during the procedure reduces clot formation.  
  
**Aneurysm rupture:** Caused by puncture of the aneurysm with the catheter, guidewire, or the coils. This occurs in about 5% of ruptured aneurysm cases that have an already weakened wall, but is less common in unruptured aneurysms.  
  
**Hemorrhage intraprocedural:** Often accompanied by an abrupt rise in mean arterial pressure.  
The blood pressure should be immediately reduced by increasing the inhalation agent, starting a Cardene or nipride infusion.  
Immediate reversal of heparin may be required (1 mg protamine for each 100 units of heparin given) and lowering of the systemic arterial pressure.  
Ask the interventionalist for the desired blood pressure.  
_P_ aCO 2 should be maintained between 45 and 50 and mannitol (0.25–0.5 grams/kg) may be given to reduce cerebral edema.  
Aneurysm perforation is usually treated by packing the defect with coils. Emergency craniotomy and clipping of aneurysm may be required if coiling fails. Patients may develop acute hydrocephalus secondary to new SAH necessitating transfer to theatre, for ventricular drainage.  
  
**Vasospasm:** Resulting from irritation by blood in the subarachnoid space or from catheter manipulation during an endovascular procedure. Vasospasm can be treated with drugs (triple-H therapy, nimodipine, papaverine) and angioplasty.  
  
**Coil position:** After placement, some coils may protrude out of the aneurysm neck and narrow the parent artery. A stent or temporary balloon may be inflated to push the coils back into the aneurysm. It is rare for a coil to move out of the aneurysm after the procedure is complete.  
  
**Incomplete occlusion:** Occurs when coils do not completely fill the aneurysm, leaving a residual neck. Blood can enter the residual neck and cause the aneurysm to regrow (recur).  
  
**Post op**  
Patient is sent back to the neuro ICU for observation.  
Patient must remain flat on their back for at least 6 hours after the procedure.  
  
A patient who underwent coiling for an unruptured aneurysm is usually released from the hospital the next day and given discharge  
  
A patient who has suffered a ruptured aneurysm typically remains in the NSICU for 14 to 21 days. During that time, he or she is monitored carefully for signs of vasospasm, a narrowing (spasm) of an artery that can occur 3 to 14 days after a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Signs of vasospasm include arm or leg weakness, confusion, sleepiness, or restlessness.
