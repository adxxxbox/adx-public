Nasal Fracture     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Nasal Fracture

Closed or Open Reduction

**Closed**: The surgeon will insert a small rod up the nares to allow him to move the fracture back into alignment.

**Open Reduction**: This case is for severe or multiple facial fractures.

**Closed Reduction:** No incision.  
**Anesthetic:** General/ ETT. You don’t necessarily need an oral Rae.  
Most of these patients get a bloody nose in the middle of the procedure. The airway needs to be protected with a cuffed ETT. When the nose starts bleeding with nasal manipulation, the blood drains back to the glottis and could easily induce a laryngeal spasm with an unprotected airway.  
**RSI:**Yes, many of these patients have blood in their stomach.  
**Inhalation Agent:** Sevo or Forane are popular for these procedures.

**Duration**: 5-20 minutes  
**EBL:** 0-20 mLs.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
**Positioning:** Supine with the HOB up 10-20 degrees or reverse Trendelenburg. Tuck the patient’s arm on the surgeon’s side. Sometimes the bed is rotated 90 degrees.

**Antiemetics**: Yes, ok for Decadron and Zofran.

**NGT**: To pass ORALLY before emergence.

**Avoid hypertension**: To minimize bleeding, but stay within 20% of the patient’s base BP.  
Emergence: Smooth; avoiding any coughing. Give Lidocaine .25 mg/kg; it helps!

**Robinul**: Yes, to prevent secretions from draining onto and agitating the vocal cords.

**Extubation**: Deep or Awake? Many CRNAs will extubate deep. Some patients may require an awake extubation, so try to make it smooth. Some CRNAs insert an LMA immediately after a deep extubation and transport the patient to the recovery room. The LMA is removed when the patient awakes. This drastically decreases turnover time.

**Possible Complications**:

Infection  
Bleeding
