### Quick Nitroglycerine (Tridil) Infusion Notes

For 25mg/250 bottle (100mcg/mL).  
  
Titrate to effect; no standard or optimum dose is defined.  
(0.2-1.5mcg/kg/min) or (5-200mcg/min).  
  
In **mcg/kg/min** \- Initial dose of 0.2mcg/kg min  
Range: 0.2 - 1.5 mcg/kg/min, increasing in increments of 0.1 mcg/kg/min Q 3-5 mins.  
  
In **mcg/min,** common practice is to start an infusion at 5 ml/hr (8 mcg/min) and titrate from there. A concentration suitable for direct IV injection for rapid dosing may be prepared by using a 5ml syringe, withdrawing 1ml of NTG from the bottle into the syringe, and adding 4ml of diluent.  
  
**Nitroglycerine (Tridil) notes**  
Other names (NITROBID IV, NITROJECT, NITROSTAT IV). Infusion rated in mcg/min was formerly used more commonly. Weight based dosing in mcg/kg/min is being used with increasing frequency.  
  
Most useful in patients with symptomatic CAD and for patients with HTN post CABG.  
Drug of choice for hypertensive emergencies associated with coronary ischemia.  
Do not use with hypertensive encephalopathy because it increases intracranial pressure. Patients may develop tolerance within 12-24hr.  
  
**Mechanism of action:** Primarily a venous dilator (and to a lesser degree an arteriolar dilator). Relaxes peripheral vascular smooth muscle by donating an NO group.  
  
**Effect:** relaxation of smooth muscle producing a vasodilator effect on the peripheral veins and arteries.  
  
Reduces cardiac oxygen demand by decreasing preload (left ventricular end-diastolic pressure).  
  
May modestly reduce afterload.  
  
Dilates coronary arteries and improves collateral flow to ischemic regions helps prevent vasospasm.  
  
**Side Effects:** Monitor for headache, hypotension, syncope, faintness.  
  
Used during anesthesia for temporary and short-acting prevention or treatment of hypertension. Usually titrated to effect.  
  
Used in ICU to prevent coronary vasospasm, Sometimes used to reduce preload May be given peripherally.  
  
**Risk:** May cause severe hypotension in the presence of hypovolemia. Carries risk of methemoglobinemia, otherwise it is similar to nitroprusside.  
  
May be used cautiously without a pump titrating to effect with a micro-drip. Frequently used in this manner during carotid surgery. More recently, beta blockers have replaced nitroglycerine drips in that setting. Use without a pump may introduce risk of overdose. Nitroglycerine is supplied in a glass bottle often requiring specialized administration tubing. If vented tubing is not available, a conventional infusion set may be used and the bottle vented with a small-gauge needle inserted through the stopper after priming the tubing.
