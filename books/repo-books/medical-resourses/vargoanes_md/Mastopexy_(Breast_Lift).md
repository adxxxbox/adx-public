Mastopexy (Breast Lift)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Mastopexy (Breast Lift)

A procedure in which the plastic surgeon raises the breasts by removing excess skin and tightening the surrounding tissue to reshape and support the new breast contour.  
  
Methods for breast lift surgery are similar to the procedures used in breast reduction surgery.  
Many women are candidates for some of the newer techniques of mastopexy which minimize the scars on the breast.  
  
Breast lifts have grown 70% since 2000, outpacing breast implants 2-to-1.  
Some women may want to consider placement of a breast implant in addition to the breast lift.  
An implant can provide improved upper breast fullness or cleavage. Implants can be placed at the same time or as a second procedure, depending on the experience of the surgeon.  
  
**Indications:** Breast ptosis (drooping)  
  
**Pathophysiology  
**Relaxation of Cooper ligaments and dermal laxity cause descent of the breast tissue and nipple area complex (NAC).  
Postpartum involutional changes exacerbate the laxity of the suspensory ligaments and skin envelope.  
  
**Possible causes of breasts ptosis  
**Pregnancy  
Breastfeeding  
Weight fluctuations  
Following implant removal  
Aging  
Gravity  
Heredity  
  
**Possible complications**  
Anesthesia risks  
Bleeding or hematoma formation  
Infection  
Poor healing of incisions  
Changes in nipple or breast sensation, which may be temporary or permanent  
Breast contour and shape irregularities  
Breast asymmetry  
Deep fat necrosis.  
Fluid accumulation  
Potential partial or total loss of nipple and areola  
Deep vein thrombosis, cardiac and pulmonary complications  
Possibility of revisional surgery  
  
**_Note:_** _Smoking, diabetes, and obesity have been associated with an increased incidence of nipple necrosis._  
  
**Mastopexy and anesthesia**  
**Pre-op**  
The surgeon will have instructed the patient to avoid taking aspirin, Advil®, Motrin®, or other cyclooxygenase II inhibitors for two weeks and to avoid smoking.  
If the patient has not complied with these instructions, inform the surgeon. This elective procedure may be canceled rather than risk the poor outcome if the instructions have not been followed.  
  
**Labs:** None required, unless indicated by the age and health of the patient.  
  
**Pre-op sedation  
**Withhold sedation until the surgeon has examined the patient and marked the operative area.  
The patient may need to stand up to be marked.  
Ensure that consent documents are complete.  
  
**Anesthetic:** General LMA or ETT.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Not usually required.  
**Position:** Supine with arms out. Patient may be positioned in high fowlers at intervals during the procedure. Adjust IV and ventilator tubing to accommodate repositioning.  
  
**BP cuff:** Either arm.  
**Duration:** 1.5 - 3 hours.  
**IV Access:** 20g is acceptable.  
**EBL:** 50-100 ml  
**Antibiotics:** cefazolin (e.g., Ancef®), if not contraindicated.  
**Emergence:** If the trachea has been intubated, extubate with the patient deeply anesthetized.
