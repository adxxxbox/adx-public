Diabetes - Oral Hypoglycemics    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Diabetes - Oral Hypoglycemics

**_Patients should not take most oral hypoglycemics once they are NPO and day of surgery._**  
  
**Pause antidiabetic treatment in the following cases:**  
Major surgery performed under general anesthesia.  
Acute conditions requiring hospitalization (infections, organ failure).  
Elective procedures associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia (periods of fasting, irregular food intake).

| Class | Mechanism of action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Biguanide** (metformin)  
Glucophage,  
Glumetza, and Glycon.  
  
Hold 1-2 days preoperatively to decrease risk of lactic acidosis.  
Most patients are asked to hold Metformin once they go NPO. | Inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis.  
Enhances glucose uptake of muscle and fat  
(increases insulin sensitivity). | 1st drug of choice in patients with Type 2 DM.  
It does not affect insulin secretion; therefore, it is not associated with hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy.  
  
Potential adverse effect is lactic acidosis (less than 1%), particularly with renal insufficiency.  
Incidence: 8 cases/100,000  
  
Avoided with cardiogenic or septic shock, congestive heart failure that requires pharmacologic therapy, severe liver disease, pulmonary insufficiency with hypoxemia, or severe tissue hypoperfusion.  
  
Must be paused prior to the administration of an IV contrast medium , or scheduled surgery to reduce the risk of lactic acidosis!  
  
May cause weight loss. |
| **Sulfonylureas**  
**1st generation:**  
Acetohexamide (Dymelor)  
Chlorpropamide (Diabinese)  
Tolazamide (Tolinase)  
Tolbutamide (Orinase)  
  
**2nd generation:**  
Glyburide (Micronase)  
Glicazide (Uni Diamicron)  
Gliburide (Diabeta)  
Glipizide (Glucotrol)  
Glimepiride (Amaryl)  
Gliquidone (Glurenorm) | Stimulates insulin release from pancreatic beta cells.  
Increases peripheral insulin sensitivity.  
  
**Extra-pancreatic effect:**  
Decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis. | May induce hypoglycemia in a fasting preoperative patient.  
Highest risk of hypoglycemia, especially with renal failure-may be life threatening.  
  
If a patient has mistakenly taken a sulfonylurea on the day of surgery, the operation may still be completed; however, careful glucose monitoring is imperative and IV dextrose may be required.  
  
**Glyburide:**The standard substance of this class with a relatively long half-life.  
  
**Glipizide:** A short-acting agent.  
  
Benefits include a 25% reduction in microvascular complications with or without insulin. |
| **Meglitinides**  
Repaglinide (Prandin)  
Nateglinide (Starlix) | Stimulates insulin release from pancreatic beta cells. | Closely resembles that of the sulfonylureas.  
Has a greater decrease in postprandial glucose and still has a risk of hypoglycemia. |
| **Thiazolidinediones (Glitazones)**  
Rosiglitazone (Avandia)  
Pioglitazone (Actos) | Enhance insulin resistance → glucose utilization is increased.  
(increases sensitivity).  
  
Mechanism of action is similar to that of metformin, but it is not associated with lactic acidosis.  
  
Decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis | **Indications:** May be considered as a monotherapy in patients with severe renal failure and/or contraindications for insulin therapy.  
They do not increase insulin secretion; therefore, hypoglycemia is low risk when used as monotherapy.  
Relatively safe in patients with impaired renal function because they are highly metabolized by the liver.  
Caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction.  
May also cause fluid retention in the postoperative phase. |
| **DPP-4 inhibitors**  
Alogliptin (Nesina)  
Linagliptin (Tradjenta)  
Saxagliptin, (Onglyza)  
Sitagliptin (Januvia)  
Teneligliptin (Tenelia)  
  
**Under development**  
Dutogliptin  
Gemiglitin | Increases insulin secretion, and decreases gastric emptying thus decreasing blood glucose levels. | May be continued prior to surgery if necessary. However, these medications primarily reduce glycemic levels after meals, and their effects will be greatly marginalized in preoperative NPO patients.  
Indicated for use as monotherapy or in combination with other agents such as metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, or insulin. |
| **GLP-1 agonists  
(incretin mimetic drugs)  
Parenteral  
Short-acting:**  
Exenatide (Byetta/Bydureon)  
Lixisenatide (Lyxumia)  
  
**Long-acting:**  
Liraglutide (Victoza)  
  
**Prolonged acting:**  
Albiglutide (Tanzeum)  
Dulaglutide (Trulicity)  
Semaglutide (Ozempic)  
  
**Under development:**  
Taspolutide | Direct stimulation of the GLP1 receptor.  
They increase insulin secretion, decreased glucagon, delayed gastric emptying, increased satiety, and may increase weigh loss. | Held the day of surgery as they slow gastric motility, and may delay restoration of proper gastrointestinal function during recovery.  
  
Not oral, but administered by injection and stimulate insulin secretion, and suppress glucagon secretion after meals in a glucose-dependent manner.  
  
No risk of hypoglycemia. |
| **Amylin Analogue**  
Pramlintide (Symlin)  
Parenteral, NOT PO | Pramlintide is a synthetic form of **amylin**, a pancreatic peptide produced by β-cells.  
Amylin and pramlintide lower postprandial glucose by lowering postprandial glucagon, and delaying gastric emptying. | Indicated for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics who use insulin.  
May cause gastroparesis. |
| **SGLT-2 Inhibitors  
(Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2)**  
Canagliflozin Invokana  
Dapagliflozin Forxiga  
Farxiga  
Empagliflozin Jardiance  
Ertugliflozin Steglatro  
  
**"Gliflozins"  
Under development:**  
Ipragliflozen  
Remogliflozen etabonate  
Tofoglifzin | A new class of drugs for Type 2 diabetes with novel mechanism of action.  
Blocks reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys, leading to excretion of glucose in urine.  
Works independently of insulin. |   |
| **Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors**  
Acarbose (Precose, Glucobay)  
Miglitol (Glyset)  
Voglibose (Basen) | When alpha-glucosidase is inhibited, it decreases intestinal glucose absorption.  
  
Effective in controlling postprandial blood glucose levels.  
  
The undigested carbohydrates reach the colon, where they are degraded by intestinal bacteria, and result in the production of intestinal gas. | In preoperative fasting states, this drug has no effect and thus should be discontinued until the patient resumes eating.  
  
Not technically a glucose lowering agents because it does not have a direct effect on insulin secretion or sensitivity.  
  
Slows the digestive and absorptive process, preventing postprandial glucose raise.  
  
Because it inhibits the breakdown and subsequent absorption of carbohydrates (dextrins, maltose, sucrose and starch; no effect on glucose) from the gut following meals, the largest impact of this drugs is on postprandial hyperglycemia. |

| Class | Mechanism of action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Dopamine agonist**  
Bromocriptine (Parlodel, Clycoset) | It is thought to act on the circadian neuronal activities in the hypothalamus to reset an abnormally elevated hypothalamic drive for increased plasma glucose, free fatty acids, and triglycerides in insulin-resistant patients. | Approved for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. |
| **Bile acid sequestrant**  
Colesevelam  
(Welchol, Cholestagel, Lodalis) | **Mechanism of action is unknown.**  
Welchol binds to bile acids in the intestine without being metabolized by the liver and kidneys. Welchol does not enter the bloodstream, so you can provide add-on efficacy without systemic absorption.  
  
Evidence suggests that bile acids may function as signaling molecules in the liver and GI tract for lipid and glucose metabolism. | Lowers LDL and improves blood sugar control in adults with Type 2 DM.  
  
When added to metformin and sulfonylureas, Colesevelam results in further reductions in Hb-A1c. |
