### About the LIMA

The Left Internal Mammary Artery (LIMA) is also known as the Left Internal Thoracic Artery (LITA).  
  
The Left Internal Mammary Artery (LIMA) is utilized much more than the Right Internal Mammary Artery (RIMA). Studies suggest an improved survival rate in patients undergoing CABG when the LIMA (rather than an SVG) is used to graft the LAD artery.  
  
This survival benefit is independent of the patient's sex, age, extent of CAD, and LV systolic function.  
  
The LIMA (Left internal mammary artery) usually originates from the first portion of the Left subclavian artery. Its sister (Right internal mammary artery) usually originates from the right subclavian artery. They both descend lateral to the sternum to the level of the 6th rib. From there they divide into the superior epigastric and musculophrenic arteries. They supply blood to the anterior chest wall.  
  
From the origin to the termination point, the length of LIMA is around 26.0 cm.  
  
When the surgeon stands (or sits) beside the table and retracts the sternum, the LMA is easily visualized. The LIMA travels parallel to the edge of the sternum and beneath the rib cage. As the overlying tissue is swept away, the LIMA itself can be easily seen.  
  
After dividing and sealing off all the side branches of the LIMA, the entire length of this vessel can be mobilized from underneath the rib cage. At this stage, both ends are still attached, but all of the side branches have been divided.  
  
The surgeon can then transfer the lower (distal) end of the LIMA down to the heart surface to the LAD which is conveniently close by.  
  
Harvesting the LIMA usually only takes around 30-45 minutes.
