### SVR determination when discontinuing cardiopulmonary bypass

Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) may be calculated using the bypass flow rate towards the end of bypass. The flow rate on the CPB machine can be used in the equation as the equivalent of cardiac output (CO).  
  
If SVR is low (500-800 dyn•sec•cm\-5 ), a vasoconstrictor is needed. A vasoconstrictor is commonly needed, because cardiopulmonary bypass causes a decrease in systemic vascular resistance.  
  
NOTE:  
**Systemic Vascular Resistance** \= 80x (mean arterial pressure - mean venous pressure \[or CVP, central venous pressure\]) / cardiac output \[or bypass flow rate\].
