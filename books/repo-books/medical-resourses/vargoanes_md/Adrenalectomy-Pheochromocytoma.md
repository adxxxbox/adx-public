### Adrenalectomy for a Pheochromocytoma

**The Surgical Resection**  
The removal of a rare norepinephrine and epinephrine-producing tumor from chromaffin cells that arises from the center part of the adrenal glands, the adrenal medulla.  
The fluctuating levels of these hormones seen in pheochromocytoma can cause organ damage from dangerously high blood pressure, leading to: death, heart attack, stroke and kidney failure.  
The surgical procedure is to go in and simply resect the adrenal gland.  But dealing with the potential or the actual massive release of these hormones is the issue.  
Any intraoperative HTN and tachycardia in the absence of another cause should lead your suspicion to pheochromocytoma and hormonal release from surgical manipulation.

**Most stimulating part of the surgery:**  
Direct laryngoscopy  
Removal of the tumor

**Rx: Phentolamine for Pheochromocytosis (See more notes below)**  
Maximum drug effect usually occurs within 2 minutes of dosing IV.  
**Adult Doses:**  
5 mg IV 1 to 2 hours before surgery, then 5 mg IV during surgery as indicated.  
**Children:** 1 mg IV 1 to 2 hours before surgery, then 1 mg IV during surgery as indicated.  
  
**Phentolamine Drip:**  
**Adults:**  0.5-1 mg/min.  
During surgery, a 5 mg. dose can also be given and then titrate the drip as needed. If Phentolamine is contraindicated, a Nipride or Nitroglycerine drip can be used.

**Pre-OP: The patient s**hould already be type and crossed with 2 units PRBCs on standby.  
**Did the patient have a bowel prep?** Ask them.  
Sedate! Lots of Versed.   
Preferred pre-op BP:  < 160/90 with no ST segment changes.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT. Some use a glide scope because it’s less stimulating to the patient when used correctly.  
**Induction:** Deep dosing to avoid sympathetic stimulation. I’ve seen Esmolol or Remifentanil given just prior to direct laryngoscopy. Consider an LTA kit.  
**A-line:** Always, usually inserted in pre-op with heavy sedation. Some prefer to wait until the patient is heavily sedated prior to induction.  
**Neosynephrine Drip**: Have primed and ready for when the tumor is removed.

**IV Access:** Two large bore IVs is recommended. These patients are usually vascularly dry, so hydrate them well. The patient will need fluid volume before the tumor is resected.  
**Positioning:** Supine or lateral. This procedure may be open or laparoscopic depending on the surgeon.

To treat hypertension with pheochromocytoma, always administer the alpha 1 blocker FIRST. Beta blockers (Beta 1 selective) do not work very well in these patients.  
The adrenaline and nor-adrenaline released by adrenal medulla act on both alpha & beta receptors. So,selective beta 1 blockers (Esmolol or Metoprolol) alone will be of no help.

Also, the unopposed alpha 1 receptor stimulation will cause more vasoconstriction, further worsening the hypertension against a beta blocked heart. This can lead to immediate cardiogenic shock.

So best strategy is to give an alpha blocker before giving beta blockers, in a patients of pheochromocytoma.

**Drugs to AVOID:**  
Atracurium and morphine (Histamine releasers).  
Pavulon, Anectine and cocaine (Sympathomimetics).  
Atropine, Droperidol, Reglan, Ephedrine and Glucagon.  
Beta blocker before an alpha blocker - Don’t do it.  
  
**Cell Saver:** Not recommended due to the possibility of recirculating released catecholamines.  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**EBL:** 1-300 mLs

**Emergency: Pre-drawn up 10mL syringes:**  
Diluted NTG (2mLs + 8mmLs NS) = 20mcg/mL  
Nipride: Not as popular (200mcg/mL) but have 10 ccs from the bag of mixed Nipride.  
Phentolamine: 2.5-5mg bolus as needed.  
Neosynephrine (40 or 80mcg/mL)  
Esmolol-always give alpha antagonists first.  
Labetalol- always give alpha antagonists first.  
Flush syringe

The 10cc syringes above should be readily available. Some people already have Phentolamine and a flush syringe connected to the IV manifold before induction.

The surgeon will almost always warn you when he/she is ready to resect the tumor. Have your emergency syringes in line. Manipulation of the tumor causes profound swings in BP. 

**After the tumor is resected: Prepare for Hypotension**  
Depending on the pheochromocytoma and what alpha-blockers the patient is on, be prepared for hypotension once the tumor is resected. That’s when your Neosynephrine drip is used if the HR is not too low from any beta-blockers. A Norepinephrine (Levophed) drip has been commonly used.

**Other Notes**  
Phenoxybenzamine (Dibenzyline) is the preferred alpha-blocker in preparation for surgery.   

There are 2 to 8 cases per 1 million persons per year. 10% of pheochromocytomas are bilateral and 10% are cancerous.

Adrenaline-producing tumors that grow outside of the adrenal glands are called "paragangliomas." 

Approximately 95% of adrenaline-secreting tumors are located within the abdomen, and of these, 85 to 90% are in the adrenal glands. 

A Neuroblastoma is one of the few cancer types known to secrete hormones.

**Phentolamine Mesylate** (Regitine) Notes

**Pharmacologic class:** Alpha-adrenergic blocker

**Action:** Competitive blockade of postsynaptic (alpha1) and presynaptic (alpha2) adrenergic receptors. It acts on both the arterial tree and venous beds, reducing total peripheral resistance and lowering venous return to the heart.  
**Indications:**  
To prevent or control hypertensive episodes before or during pheochromocytomectomy.  
To prevent or treat dermal necrosis after norepinephrine extravasation.  
  
**Pheochromocytosis Doses:**  
Maximum effect usually occurs within 2 minutes of dosing.  
**Adult Doses:** 5 mg IV 1 to 2 hours before surgery, then 5 mg IV during surgery as indicated.  
**Children:** 1 mg IV 1 to 2 hours before surgery, then 1 mg IV during surgery as indicated.

**Drip:**  
**Adults:**  0.5-1 mg/min.  
During surgery a 5 mg dose can also be given and titrate the drip as needed. The literature tells us to record BP immediately after injection, at 30-second intervals for the first 3 minutes, and at 60-second intervals for the next 7 minutes.  
  
**Positive Response:** A drop in BP of more than 35 mmHg systolic and 25 mmHg diastolic pressure. A typical positive response may be a drop of 60 mmHg systolic and 25 mm Hg diastolic. Maximal depressor pressure effect usually is evident within 2 minutes after injection. Return to pre-injection pressure commonly occurs within 15 to 30 minutes, but may return more rapidly.

**IV Infiltration**:  
**Adults:** For prevention, add 10 mg to each liter of IV solution containing norepinephrine. For treatment, inject 5 to 10 mg in 10 ml of normal saline solution into extravasated area within 12 hours.

**Off-label uses**

Hypertensive crisis caused by MAO inhibitors.  
Rebound hypertension caused by withdrawal of clonidine, propranolol, or other antihypertensives.  
Erectile dysfunction (given with papaverine).

**Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to drug  
CAD  
MI or history of MI  
Coronary insufficiency  
Angina

**Precautions**

Use cautiously with patients receiving cardiac glycosides concurrently, and pregnant or breastfeeding patients.

**Adverse reactions**

**CNS:** weakness, dizziness

**CV:** tachycardia, acute and prolonged hypotension, orthostatic hypotension and arrhythmias.

**EENT:** nasal congestion

**GI:** nausea, vomiting and diarrhea

**Skin:** flushing

**Interactions:**

**Drug-drug.** Ephedrine, epinephrine: antagonism of these drugs' effects.

**Drug-herbs.** Ephedra (ma huang): antagonism of vasoconstrictive effects.

**Goal:** Don’t allow SNS stimulation. Most of all these patients are already on an alpha-blocker and/or a beta-blocker and the patient’s BP should be under control before surgery. Some patients may even be on drips rather than the PO versions.  

**Common Alpha Blockers:**  
Phentolamine (Regitine): ½ life of 19 minutes  
Prazosin (Minipress): ½ life of 2-3 hours  
Phenoxybenzamine (Dibenzyline): ½ life of 24 hours.
