### Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) for Prostatectomy

Usually robotic**Note:** ERAS protocols vary among institutions.  
Confirm case posting for ERAS protocol.**  
  
Room set-up and preparation**  
**Equipment:**  
Non-invasive CO monitor and patient attachments.  
60 mL LR Flush syringe (patient IV tubing will be connected to a pump).   
Equipment: Ultrasound for TAP blocks (if laparoscopic or robotic surgical approach).  
4” & 6” stimuplex block needle and (2) vials 0.25% bupivicaine 1:200K epinephrine (if TAP blocks indicated).  
Forced Air Warming Blanket (after prep and drape).  
  
**Meds to draw up**  
Ketamine 50 mg  
Magnesium 2gm (mixed in 100 mL bag)  
Antibiotic prophylaxis (per protocol).  
Dexamethasone 10 mg  
Midazolam (Versed®) 2mg IV  
Fentanyl 100 mcg  
IV acetaminophen (Ofirmev®) (if patient has not received oral acetaminophen pre-op)  
Neosynephrine bag  
**Note:** If not contraindicated, consider induction with rocuronium in preference to succinylcholine to avoid abdominal muscle activity during transverse abdominis plane (TAP) blocks.**  
  
Ambulatory care unit (ACU) hand-off  
**Review chart to determine if the patient has taken celocoxib (Celebrex®) or acetaminophen (Tylenol®). Avoid acetaminophen (Ofirmev®) and ketorolac (Toradol®) if already taken.  
Standard pre-procedure check-off  
Confirm pump tubing and fluids on pump at 25 ml/hr in ACU.  
Confirm patient received 1,000 mL IV fluid bolus.  
Limit pre-op sedation: < 2mg midazolam IV  
ERAS post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) prophylaxis (scopolamine)  
ERAS multimodal analgesics (gabapentin)  
Confirm deep venous thrombosis (VTE) /deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis (sequential compression device / subcutaneous heparin if indicated (if epidural placed, >1 hr after placement).  
Confirm that perioperative glycemic control order set has been activated.  
**  
Intra-op, prior to incision**  
60 ml syringe of normal saline for flush  
Follow ERAS fluid protocol 3mL/kg/hour for laparoscopic.  
5ml/kg/hour for open procedure  
Antibiotic prophylaxis (per protocol)  
Acetaminophen 1 g IV (15 mg/kg)  
Dexamethasone 10 mg IV  
Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg just prior to incision and 10 mg per hour.   
IV acetaminophen (Ofirmev®) 1 gram if acetaminophen not used pre-op.  
Establish fluid administration as directed by institutional protocol.   
Forced air warming blanket (after prep and drape).  
4 quadrant TAP block (if laparoscopic or robotic surgical approach).  
  
**Intra-op and maintenance  
**500 ml crystalloid bolus or 250 mL of 5% albumin if needed as directed by institutional protocol  
**Ventilator:** Pressure controlled ventilation with tidal volume 6ml/kg.  
Maintain normothermia  
Limit fentanyl to 100 mcg if possible.  
  
**Blood Glucose Monitoring**  
**Diabetic patient**  
Baseline check 60 minutes post induction or 60 minutes after last check in ACU (diabetic patients).  
Check blood sugars Q 1 hour and follow institution sliding scale.  
  
**Non-diabetic patients:**  
Check blood sugar within 60 minutes after induction.  
Maintain blood glucose between 100-180 mg/dl.  
Check blood glucose Q2hr (“finger stick” or other sampling technique).  
  
**Closing and emergence**  
Ondansetron (Zofran®) 4mg IV  
Ketorolac (if ok with surgeon and the patient has normal renal function; 30 mg IV pts <65 years; 15 mg IV >65 years  
Awake extubation in the OR  
  
**Post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) hand-off  
**Inform PACU RN that ERAS protocol was followed.  
Report last blood glucose measurement, time and intervention.  
Report last antibiotic dose and time.  
Report acetaminophen/Ketolorac dose and time.  
SCDs from PACU arrival until discharge–while in bed or chair.  
Multi-modal medications are scheduled and should remain on schedule, NOT PRN.
