### Interstim Bladder Pacemaker Insertion

(Interstim Therapy or Sacral Nerve Stimulation)  
The word “Interstim” is just a registered trademark of Medtronic, Inc.

InterStim Therapy uses a small device the size of a pacemaker, which is placed under the skin in a small subdermal pocket in the buttock region. It employs an implanted unilateral lead stimulating the sacral nerves (mostly S-3 nerve root) that is attached to a small pacemaker. A lead wire is connected to the device and sends electrical impulses to the S3 nerve. The impulses stimulate the nerve(s) that suppress bladder contraction offering relief to patients with overactive bladder syndrome (OBS).

**Note:** The sacral nerves (specifically S2, S3 and S4) activate or inhibited muscles and organs that contribute to urinary control-the bladder, sphincter and pelvic floor muscles. The electrical stimulation may eliminate or reduce certain bladder control functions in some people.

**Indications:**  
OBS  
Nonobstructive urinary retention (incomplete bladder emptying) Concurrent pelvic floor dysfunction

The patient must have documentation of the three above from a bladder function test and have tried two different medications (anticholinergics) without success.

**Surgical Procedure- 2 parts  
Part 1**  
Almost always in the doctor’s office. A test stimulator temporary lead is inserted with just using a local injection and sometimes some sedation. The patient is positioned prone and communicates with the doctor the location of sensation combined with twitching of a foot and bellowing of the buttocks. The temporary lead will exit and taped to the skin on the lower back. The lead will be and attached to an external test stimulator (size of a beeper) that the patient wears for a week and keeps a diary of voiding symptoms and habits. If there is a marked improvement after a week, a permanent pacer wire and stimulator is inserted-Part 2

**Part 2**  
Is done in an operating room. A long-term lead and neurostimulator will be implanted in the upper buttock or abdomen. If a long-term lead was used for the initial test stimulation, the long-term lead will remain in place. If a temporary external wire was used for the test stimulation, it will be replaced with a long term lead, and a neurostimulator will be connected and tunneled and under the skin in the upper buttock or abdomen.

**Anesthesia:** Usually MAC, rarely a General  
The patient usually only needs to be deepened with some Propofol for the creation of the stimulator pouch. The doctor may still want to communicate with the patient during the procedure. So always check the doctor to see what he/she wants.  
**If General/ETT,** use a short acting muscle relaxant because you don’t want to impair the ability to stimulate the sacral nerves or visualize their motor response.  
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes  
**Position:** Prone. Let the patient self-position himself or herself to their comfort level. A pillow is usually placed under the waist and of coarse the chin area.  
**NC with ETCO2:** Yes  
**IV Access:** 22g is acceptable. Avoid the antecubital area since the patient’s arms will be flexed while prone.  
EBL: Minimal

**Possible Complications**  
Bleeding  
Swelling  
Bruising  
Infection

**Sacral neuromodulation might cause the patient to experience some of these side effects:**  
Pain at the implant site or new pain  
Infection or skin irritation  
Lead (thin wire) movement/migration  
Device problems  
Interactions with certain other devices or diagnostic equipment  
Undesirable changes in urinary or bowel function  
Uncomfortable stimulation (sometimes described as a jolting or shocking feeling

**More Notes**  
OBS-used to be referred as urge incontinence or detrusor instability.  
  
InterStim therapy may also be called neuromodulation of the bladder.  
  
The prevalence of OBS is increasing with our aging population. A significant number will require sacral nerve stimulation.

**How the Sacral Nerve Works**  
There is a two-way communication between the brain and bladder. The sacral nerves \[specifically S2, S3 and S4\] activate or inhibited muscles and organs that contribute to urinary control-the bladder, sphincter and pelvic floor muscles. Sometimes, the two-way communication between the brain and bladder is disrupted. When this happens, patients may experience symptoms of bladder control problems. For many patients, sacral nerve stimulation may augment the communication between the brain and the bladder therefore reducing the symptoms associated with bladder control problems.

InterStim therapy DOES NOT treat symptoms of stress incontinence. It has not been studied in pregnant patients, pediatric patients, patients with diabetes, or patients with multiple sclerosis. It is not intended for patients with mechanical obstruction such as benign prostatic hypertrophy, cancer or urethral strictures.

150,000 people worldwide have received the InterStim System. It has been FDAapproved since 1997 for urge incontinence and since 1999 for urinary retention and urgency-frequency. Medtronic Bladder Control Therapy is not intended for patients with a urinary blockage.

At this time (2014), the only sacral nerve stimulation device available and FDA approved for OAB is the Inter-Stim® Therapy by Medtronic. Nationally, four in five patients have a positive reaction to this therapy.

**Office Surgical Procedure Details**  
Patient is positioned prone. His/her socks and shoes are removed to allow visualization of the feet. With the use of a C-arm, the midline of the spine and level of S3 foramen are imaged and skin markings are made. After local infiltration, a 20-gauge 3.5-inch insulated foramen needle is then inserted into the S3 foramen bilaterally at a 60° angle relative to the skin with the aid of the C-arm. Once the S3 foramen is located with the foramen needle, a lateral image confirms location and depth in the foramen. The bilateral foramen needles are then stimulated to confirm correct placement in the S3 foramen. Responses signaling correct placement include bellows contraction of the pelvic floor and plantar flexion of the great toe. With the in-office test stimulation, the patient will also be able to confirm correct placement with contraction or tingling of the pelvic floor muscles (eg, rectum, vagina, and perineum).

**S2 stimulation:** plantar flexion of the entire foot with lateral rotation.  
**S4 stimulation:** No lower extremity movement despite bellows response.

Once the physician has confirmed correct placement in the S3 foramina bilaterally, temporary test lead wires are passed through the foramen needles and the needles are removed with care given to maintain position of the leads. The temporary test leads with unipolar electrodes are secured to the patient’s back with sterile strips and dressing.

**Part 2** (hospital procedure) is similar to the office-based test, but involves tined quadripolar leads, thus improving lead fixation and test response, and can be performed using just a local, MAC or even general/ETT anesthesia.
