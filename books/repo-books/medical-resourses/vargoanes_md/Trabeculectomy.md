Trabeculectomy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Trabeculectomy

The most common glaucoma surgery performed; it allows for drainage of aqueous humor from within the eye to underneath the conjunctiva where it is absorbed. This decreases IOP.   
**Anesthetic:** Usually MAC with a Retrobulbar block.  
Usually 2mg of Versed pre-op and Alfenta or Propofol just prior to the retrobulbar block. Don’t over sedate the patient because snoring is magnified through the microscope.  
**Duration:** 30-90 minutes.  
**IV Access**: 22G is acceptable. A 500mL NS bag with micro drip tubing is popular.  
Many of these patients are diabetic and very hypertensive.  
**Position:** Supine with arms tucked and the patient remains on the same stretcher. Make sure the ETCO2 NC is looped away from the surgical eye. The stretcher is parked 90-180 degrees away from you (unless you are starting out as a general).  
**EBL:** Minimal. Be careful giving Toradol.
