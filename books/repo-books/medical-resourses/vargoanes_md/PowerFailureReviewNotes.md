## Power Failure Review Notes

A massive power failure that hinders the function of an operating room is very rare. In 99% of the time, hospital’s the back up generator will immediately restore the operating room’s electricity. In a few occasions, it may take several seconds. Either way, you need to be prepared in case the back up generator fails.

**Back up generator and emergency (red) power outlets**  
When a hospital loses it’s primary electrical source, it’s the back up generator is initiated. Unfortunately, the back up generator only powers the “Red” (emergency) electrical outlets. So anything of importance should always be plugged into a red electrical outlet.

**Anesthesia Machines also have a back up battery**  
All anesthesia machines should be equipped with a back up supply of battery power (UPS). They should be periodically inspected by the hospital’s BioMed Techs.

If your ventilator alarms and reads that it is using the battery after the generator restores the operating room’s power, then the anesthesia machine is probably NOT plugged into an emergency red power outlet.

You should NEVER start any elective cases when relying on generator/back –up power.

**Pyxis Machine with Power Failure  
**The Pyxis also has a back up battery with a limited time limit.

Pyxis or any other electronic powered automated medication dispensing system may soon shut down and become inoperable for an extended time during and after the power failure (if the back up generator fails and/or it’s back up battery becomes exhausted.

Any drawer that is already open will remain open. Any drawer that is closed, will become locked when the Pyxis machine loses all power and shuts down. You will not be able to log in or pull any of the closed drawers open to gain access.

**Calling the OR Pharmacist if Pyxis Machine Becomes Locked Down**  
The OR Pharmacy Dept. will have a key to the automated drug supply machine and are able to access additional drugs for you despite the power failure.

**Power Failure with NO Back Generator Back Up**  
This event is extremely rare and you may never see it in your lifetime thanks to US Government safety regulations. However, if the hospital’s back up generator fail, you will have a room of darkness with no power. The emergency red outlets will no longer supply electrical power.

  
**Electrical Powered Operating Room Phones  
**The electrical powered phone will be nonfunctional for a full power outage.

Call for a 2 way radio.

**Anesthesia Machine**  
Your ventilator should alarm to let you know it is now running on the back-up battery.  
**  
To conserve battery life on ventilator:  
**_Switch from controlled ventilation to spontaneous and manually ventilate the patient via reservoir bag_**.  
**Do not use Desflurane vaporizer. Use Isoflurane or Sevoflurane.  
TIVA is optional.

Ohmeda anesthesia machine under normal operating condition -100% (controlled ventilation) will last 20 minutes via back up battery power.  
A fully charged back up battery for the Aesteiva/5 (GE Healthcare, Madison, WI), will last 45 minutes under normal operating conditions.

If you manually ventilate the patient with the reservoir bag, that reduces the anesthesia machine effort down to around 25%. The Ohmeda and similar anesthesia machines will quadruple in longevity.  

**Electrical outlets on the back of Anesthesia Machines**  
Most electrical outlets on the back of the anesthesia machines are utilized to power the anesthesia monitors and Desflurane the vaporizer. These outlets are not supplied by the backup battery. So with no generator back up forcing the anesthesia machine to rely on the back up battery, the monitors and Desflurane vaporizer will all lose power.

**Electrical Charting**  
Like any other device that requires electricity, it will also fail when not provided energy. You will need to convert to paper charting if electronic charting fails.

All elective cases are on HOLD and will not be started until cleared.  
  
Use battery powered portable monitor

Nitrous-no, scavenging system may be down?
