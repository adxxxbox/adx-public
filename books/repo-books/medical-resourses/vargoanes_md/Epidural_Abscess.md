### Epidural Abscess

The formation of an epidural abscess is rare, with an incidence ranging from 1:6,500-1:500,000 cases.  
It has a much higher incidence where epidural catheters are left in place for more than 72 hours.  
Patients can develop an epidural abscess independent of neuraxial blockade.  
It has a more insidious onset, with progressively increasing back pain over the course of several days as a common presentation.  
Neurological deficits, fever and elevated WBC counts are often later findings, and the treatment is neurosurgical drainage and prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy.  
**  
Risk factors for Epidural Abscess**  
Back trauma  
IV Drug abuse  
Neurological surgical procedures  
  
Epidural abscesses associated with neuraxial anesthesia are generally due to an indwelling epidural catheter. Signs and symptoms develop between 5 days and several weeks.  
  
**Four stages have been suggested:**

1.  Back or vertebral pain intensified by percussion over bony vertebrae. The patient with back pain and fever should alert the anesthesia provider to the possibility of an epidural abscess.
2.  Nerve root and radicular pain.
3.  Motor, sensory, and/or sphincter dysfunction.
4.  Progression to paralysis or paraplegia.  

The prognosis is dependent upon when an epidural abscess is diagnosed. If an epidural abscess is suspected, the epidural catheter should be immediately removed and the tip cultured. The epidural insertion site should be inspected for signs and symptoms of infection. If drainage can be expressed from the site, it should be sent for analysis. In addition, blood cultures should be sent for analysis. If an epidural abscess is suspected, a neurological consult should be sought. The most common causative agents are staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. Antibiotic coverage should be immediately instituted. A MRI or CT can confirm or rule out the diagnosis. Additional treatment for a confirmed epidural abscess includes a decompression laminectomy.  
  
**Prevention of this complication is important**  
Sterile technique is essential when inserting epidural catheters.  
Hat, mask, sterile gloves, hand washing, a sterile field, and proper preparation of the skin should take place.   
If there is any doubt that sterility has been violated, stop and start over.   
  
If the epidural catheter has been disconnected, the anesthesia provider must use their clinical judgment to decide whether to aseptically reattach the infusion or remove the catheter.  
Reduce catheter manipulation   
Maintain a closed system at all times.   
**Use the bacterial filter that comes with the epidural kit.****  
  
Remove the epidural catheter after 96 hours.**  
If the epidural is required for a period longer than 96 hours, remove the current catheter and replace with another every 96 hours.
