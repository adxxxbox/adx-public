### Charting While on Bypass

Urine output: Chart pre-pump total and then chart every 30-60 minutes.  
  
Record:

-   MAP (no real systolic or diastolic while on pump)  
    Temperature, BIS and CVP.

The SvO2 reading is not valid with lack of pulmonary blood flow.  
  
CO measurements do not work during bypass.  
  
Record all labs and ABG results. Specimens will be obtained by perfusionist.  
  
Review and confirm insulin protocol.  
  
Perfusonist will transfuse if Hct is < 20% or if the bypass reservoir volume is low and Hct is < 25%. Guidelines vary among institutions.
