### Cocaine Pharmacology

**Street name:** Crack, blow  
Cocaine (Benzoylmethylecgonine) is isolated from the leaves of the coca plant (Erythroxylon coca).

**Cocaine has two major pharmacological actions:**  
A local anesthetic (Na channel blocker)  
An indirect-acting sympathomimetic that has many of the properties of amphetamine.  
**  
Medical/surgical use:**  
Used as a topical anesthetic for the mucus membranes of the oral, laryngeal, and nasal cavities.  
Limits bleeding by vasoconstriction.  
  
**Recreational use:** Increases alertness, feelings of well-being, euphoria, energy, sociability and sexuality.  
  
**Local anesthetic type:** Ester  
**pKA:** 8.6**  
  
Mechanism of action:  
Local anesthesia:**\- Like other local anesthetics, it binds to the intracellular portion of sodium channels and slows or blocks sodium influx into nerve cells, preventing depolarization.  
\- It also blocks monoamine (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin) reuptake transporters at the presynaptic space with equal affinity.  
\- This results in the accumulation and excess of transmitters at the postsynaptic cleft resulting in enhanced and prolonged sympathetic effects.  
**\- Note** that Cocaine results only in the accumulation of but NOT an increased release of catecholamines.  
  
**The accumulation of transmitters:**  
Dopamine  
Serotonin  
Norepinephrine  
  
**Excess serotonin results in:  
**Euphoria  
Alertness  
Out of body experience  
Confidence  
  
**Excess dopamine:** Addictive qualities  
**Excess norepinephrine:** Results on the feelings of energy, cardiac effects.  
**Cocaine increases glutamate and aspartate in the brain.**  
Glutamate and aspartate are excitatory neurons in the brain, particularly in the nucleus accumbens.  
Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system.  
Aspartate has similar actions but is not well understood.  
  
**Dose-related effects:  
1-3 mg/kg:** Safe local anesthetic dose  
**20-30 mg:** Usual recreational dose when a line of cocaine is snorted  
**\> 1 g:** Potentially lethal  
**Concentrations > 4%:** Increase potential for systemic toxic reactions.  
4% cocaine is used for sinus surgery.

| Route | Concentration (%) | Max dose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Topical | 2-12 | 1.5 mg/kg or 200 mg (literature varies) |

**Dose:**  
\- Nasal: 1-2 ml to each nostril (1-10%)  
\- Apply 1-4% solution TOPICALLY with cotton applicators or as a spray to mucous membranes. 1.5 mg/kg should be sufficient.  
 10% solution produces more pronounced effects and increases the risk of toxic reactions.  
\- Despite some literature, concentrations > 4% are not recommended.  
**Possible routes of administration:**  
Oral  
Nasal (snorting)  
Gastrointestinal  
Rectal  
Vaginal mucosa  
Intravenous  
Pulmonary alveoli following inhalation  
**Onset** (into cerebral circulation):

| Route | Onset | Peak action | Duration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Intravenous | < 1 minute (seconds) | 3-5 mins | 30-60 mins |
| Nasal | 1-5 minutes | 20-30 mins | 60-120 mins |
| Smoking | < 1 minute (seconds) | 3-5 mins | 30-60 mins |
| GI | 30-60 minutes | 60-90 mins | Unknown |

**High and rush:  
Snorting:** Euphoria; only produces a high**Smoking and injecting cocaine:** Produces a rush and then a high  
  
**Bioavailability:**  
**Smoked:** 70%  
**Intranasal (snorting):** 20 - 60%  
Less bioavailability with intranasal application due to local vasoconstriction slowing absorption.  
  
**Volume of distribution:** Highly lipid-soluble with VD = 2.7 L/kg  
**Protein bound:** 90%  
**Metabolism:** Rapid, by liver and plasma cholinesterase to water-soluble metabolites.  
**Half-life:** 30 - 90 minutes  
  
**Elimination:**  
\- Less than 5% of the drug appears unchanged in the urine.  
\- Metabolites may persist in the blood and urine for up to 36 hours.  
\- Benzoylecgonine is the primary metabolite used in drug testing since its concentration in urine is 50 to 100 times greater than that of cocaine.  
  
**Cocaine metabolism:** Rapid, followed by urinary excretion of metabolites, proved to be the primary route of elimination in all cases.\- Metabolites pose no cocaine-like stimulating effects and have a long half-life, persisting in the urine long enough to produce a prolonged positive urine test.  
\- Unlike the case with consuming alcohol, urine tests for cocaine are poor markers of acute intoxication.  
**Two main metabolites:  
\- Ecgonine methyl ester and benzoylecgonine:** They account for greater than 80% of the inactive metabolites.  
**\- Norcocaine:** Active; accounts for 10% of the toxic metabolites.  
  
**Other cocaine metabolites:**  
m-hydroxycocaine  
p-hydroxycocaine  
m-hydroxybenzoylecgonine  
p-hydroxybenzoylecgonine  
  
**After the last use cocaine or its metabolites persist:**  
**Peak plasma levels:** About 60 minutes after nasal or oral intake.  
**Blood or saliva:** Up to 2 days  
Only a small percentage (1–5%) of cocaine ingested is cleared unmetabolized in urine, where it may be detected for three to six hours after use.  
  
**Saliva:**  
Elimination of cocaine has a half-life of 2 hours, while some cases have reported cocaine concentrations in the saliva even after 19 hours.  
  
**Sweat:**  
\- Peak level of cocaine concentrations in perspiration is 4.5 to 24 hours.  
\- Sweat can be tested with a skin patch, but this is not a standard test.  
\- Results can vary based on where the patch is placed.  
  
**Hair:**\- Hair testing can detect cocaine for months after use.  
\- Results can vary depending on the site from which hair is sampled.  
  
**\- Urine drug test for cocaine:** Urine tests for cocaine are poor markers of acute intoxication but may reflect surreptitious cocaine abuse in the past.\- Deficient concentrations may be detected during the initial few hours after absorption.**Urine (drug screen):** Up to 7 days (usually three days)  
**Chronic abuser urine test:** 16 days  
**Hair test:** For months  
  
**Cocaine and alcohol:** Cocaethylene metabolite  
When cocaine is taken with alcohol, it produces a highly toxic metabolite - cocaethylene or ethyl cocaine.  
It can account for up to 17 percent of the metabolites and is more toxic than cocaine.  
Cocaethylene can increase the duration of action up to 13 hours depending on the route of administration.  
It also has similar vasoconstrictive, cardiotoxic, dysrhythmogenic and neurotoxic effects.  
Cocaethylene is as potent as cocaine at inhibiting dopamine reuptake.
