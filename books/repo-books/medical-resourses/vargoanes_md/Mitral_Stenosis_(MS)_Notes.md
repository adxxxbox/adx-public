### Mitral Stenosis (MS) Notes

MS is the narrowing of the area of the valve itself.  
  
**Mitral valve dimensions**  
Normal valve surface area 4-6 cm 2  
Symptom free until 1.5-2.5 cm 2  
Moderate stenosis 1-1.5 cm 2  
Severe stenosis <1 cm 2  
**  
New criteria for diagnosis of severe MS includes an open area of:  
**< 1.0 cm 2 with a transvalvular mean gradient of > 10 mmHg.  
Symptoms may begin when mitral orifice is < 1.5 cm 2 \- 2.5 cm 2  
  
**Incidence:** Affects only 1:100,000 of people in the US.  
**Most common cause:** Rheumatic fever. Incidence of this is decreasing due to successful antimicrobial therapy for streptococcal pharyngitis.  
**  
Other causes of MS  
**Carcinoid syndrome.  
Left atrial myxoma.  
Severe mitral annular calcification.  
Congenital valve abnormalities.  
Systemic lupus erythematosus.  
Endocarditis.  
Cor triatriatum.  
Rheumatoid arthritis.  
Congenital mitral stenosis.  
Iatrogenic mitral stenosis after mitral valve repair.  
  
**Onset:** 10-25 years after rheumatic fever in undeveloped countries.  
20-40 years after rheumatic fever in developed countries.  
  
**Prevalence:** More women than men.  
Women: 1.6%  
Men: 0.4%  
  
**Morbidity  
Risk of:  
**CHF.  
Atrial Fib.  
Thromboembolism.  
Stroke.  
Pulmonary hypertension.  
Right heart failure.  
Pulmonary edema.  
  
**A-fib and MS**  
The stretching of the LA increases the risk of A-fib.  
Mitral stenosis with A-fib increases the risk of stroke 7-15% per year.  
_Stroke volume will decrease with tachycardia or when LA contraction is gone, as with atrial fib._  
Mild to moderate MS may be asymptomatic until exertion with tachycardia.  
  
**Mortality  
**40% 2-year mortality for infants with severe congenital MS.  
  
**Etiology and risk factors**  
Predominantly as a sequela of rheumatic fever.  
40% of isolated MS is a result of rheumatic fever.  
  
**Pathophysiology  
**The resistance of valvular obstruction increases LA volume and pressure.The resistance of the LV filling is initially compensated by LV hypertrophy with an advanced atrial “kick.”  
Decreased filling: Cardiac output relies on atrial “kick” in order to acquire sufficient LVEDV.  
To handle the increased LA volume, the LA dilates, keeping the pulmonary artery pressure low.  
Left ventricular filling and volume are still maintained at rest by the increased left atrial pressure.  
However, the increased left atrial pressure (LAP) will overwhelm the LA, and the LA filling pressure will thus become impaired.  
Pulmonary venous pressure increases with the increased LA pressure.  
When pulmonary venous pressure exceeds plasma oncotic pressure, pulmonary edema may occur.  
Transudation of fluid develops in pulmonary interstitial space.  
Decreases pulmonary compliance.  
Increases work of breathing causing dyspnea on exertion.  
Due to back pressure, the pulmonary venous pressure increases PA pressure  
to >25 mmHg.  
Pulmonary hypertension soon develops  
If increased LA pressure is gradual, the pulmonary lymphatic system can drain the excess transudation and avoid pulmonary edema.  
Eventually right sided heart failure will occur.  
  
LV function is usually preserved.  
There is also a decrease in LV stroke volume secondary to a decrease in LV end-diastolic volume (preload).  
  
**Conditions typically present in the mitral valve with MS:  
**Diffuse thickening of the mitral leaflets and subvalvular apparatus  
Commissural fusion  
Calcification of the annulus and leaflets  
  
**Effects of mitral stenosis:  
End-diastolic volume (preload):** Decreased  
**ESV:** Decreased or no change  
**Stroke volume:** Decreased  
**Inotropy:** No change  
**Compliance:** No change  
**Afterload:** No change  
**Stroke work:** Decreased  
  
**Symptoms**  
Dyspnea on exertion  
Orthopnea  
Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea as a result left atrial high pressure.  
  
**Pathophysiology  
**The valvular obstruction increases LA volume and pressure  
Initially the left atrium dilates, keeping the pulmonary artery pressure low.  
Left ventricular filling and volume are still maintained at rest by the increased left atrial pressure.  
_Stroke volume will decrease with tachycardia or when LA contraction is gone, as with atrial fibrillation._  
Symptoms develop when mitral orifice is < 1.5 cm 2 .  
  
**Pulmonary edema may complicate MS with:**  
Sepsis  
Pain  
pregnancy  
A-fib**\> 50% of patients with MS will have another, coexisting valvular pathology:** most commonly mitral regurgitation, but 25% will have aortic involvement as well.  
  
**25% of patients with MS will have LV dysfunction** secondary to another valve lesion, myocarditis from the original lesion, or coexisting hypertension and/or coronary artery disease.  
  
The pressure gradient across the narrow mitral orifice increases with the square of cardiac output (e.g. pregnancy). Rapid heart rates, especially with atrial fibrillation, decrease diastolic filling time and markedly decrease cardiac output.  
  
**_LV filling is optimized by a slow heart rate._**  
Patients are frequently dyspneic due to fluid transudate into the lungs. Lung compliance drops and the work of breathing increases. Pulmonary edema may occur if the pulmonary venous pressures exceed the plasma oncotic pressures. This is especially likely if a large fluid bolus, head down position or a uterine contraction raises pulmonary pressure suddenly.  
  
Assuming a constant area, small changes in CO or diastolic time (with tachycardia) can lead to large changes in the pressure gradient. LA pressures > 25mmHg will lead to acute pulmonary edema, and if present in the long term, will lead to increased PVR.  
  
**Examination**  
Mitral facies: malar flush on cheeks.  
Peripheral cyanosis  
**Signs of right heart failure:** elevated JVP, hepatomegaly, peripheral edema, ascites.  
  
A tapping apex beat upon auscultation of heart sounds: a loud first heart sound, an opening snap if in sinus rhythm and low pitched diastolic murmur heard best at the apex with the bell of the stethoscope.
