# Ropivacaine

**Ropivacaine (Naropin)**  
**Class:** Amide type Local Anesthetic, long acting.  
**Structure and pharmacokinetics:** similar to bupivacaine  
Less cardiac toxicity risk than bupivacaine.  
Less lipid soluble and cleared by the liver more rapidly than bupivacaine. Has a better sensory-motor differentiation than others.  
Similar to bupivacaine but has a shorter duration.  
**Epinephrine** has no effect on onset, duration or systemic absorption.  
Not recommended for kids <12, or for paracervical/retrobulbar blocks. **Infiltration 0.2-0.5%**  
**Onset:** Fast  
**Duration:** 120-360 mins  
**Max Dose:** 200mg  
  
**Peripheral Nerve Block 0.5-1%**  
**Onset:** Slow  
**Duration:** 300-480 mins  
**Max Dose:** 250mg (35-50mLs)  
  
**Epidural/Caudal 0.5-1%**  
**Onset:** Moderate  
**Duration:** 120-360 mins  
**Max Dose:** 200mg (15-30mL)  
**Labor Pain:** 20-40mg (10-20mL) then 12-28mg/hr  
**Post Op Pain:** 12-20mg/hr (6-10mL)  
**Spinal:** Unknown  
**MOA:** Like other local anesthetics, it binds to the intracellular portion of sodium channels and blocks sodium influx into nerve cells, which prevents depolarization.  
  
**In Detail:** Prevents transmission of nerve impulses by inhibiting the passage of Na ions through their specific channels. It is speculated that local anesthetics bind to specific sites on the inner portion of the Na channels (internal gate or H gate) near their external openings to maintain those channels in an inactivated state.  
**Metabolized:** To 2,6-pipecoloxylidide and 3-hydroxyropivicaine by hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzymes. These 2 metabolites are weak compared to Ropivacaine.  
Only 1% is excreted unchanged in the urine if the liver is normal. In uremic patients, 2,6-pipecoloxylidide may accumulate and produce toxic effects  
**CNS and Cardiac manifestations to watch for:**  
Euphoria  
Dizziness  
Tinnitus  
Twitching  
Tremors  
Convulsions  
Hypotension  
Cardiac Arrest
