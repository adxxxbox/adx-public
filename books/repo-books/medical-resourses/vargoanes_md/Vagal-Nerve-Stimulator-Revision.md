Vagal Nerve Stimulator (VNS) Revision     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Vagal Nerve Stimulator (VNS) Revision

These cases are usually very simple and short cases because they just involve a battery change. The surgeon will interrogate the VNS like a pacemaker after it is exposed. On rare occasion the surgeon will need to do lead change out or add a lead which may be more extensive. So always check with the surgeon.

**Anesthetic:** General/LMA and sometimes an ETT if expected to be extensive. Theatrically you could mange this case with a MAC, but we usually just insert an LMA. Remember that your patient may require more anesthesia from being on anticonvulsant meds (except for levetiracetam).

**Position:** Supine, arms tucked and head turned to the right. Make sure your EKG leads are out of the way. They may prep the left neck just incase the vagus nerve needs accessed.  
**Duration:** usually 30-60 minutes  
**IV Access:** 20g is acceptable.   
**EBL:** Minimal  
**Anticonvulsant meds:** Yes, be aware what anticonvulsant meds patient is on. Sometimes these meds are interrupted for the procedure and their seizure threshold level may be lowered. Avoid Demerol and Ketamine.

**More Notes**  
Some patients may undergo complete removal of the lead. Microsurgical dissection is allowed for the removal of the helical electrode from the vagus nerve without physiological consequences.

Some patients will have a new electrode placed just proximal to the original lead site. This being said, this procedure becomes longer in duration than the initial device placement.
