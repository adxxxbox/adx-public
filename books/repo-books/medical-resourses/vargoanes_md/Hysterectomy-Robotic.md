### Hysterectomy-Robotic

**There are two types of robotic hysterectomy procedures:**

**Simple hysterectomy:** Involving removal of just the uterus and cervix.

**Radical hysterectomy:** Used as a primary treatment for early-stage cervical cancer in which the parametria (bands of connective tissue in the pelvis), uterosacral ligaments and upper vagina are also removed.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT

Also refer to _“Robotic Procedures and Anesthesia.”_

**Duration:** 1-4 hours (depending on the surgeon's experience).

**Position:** Lithotomy, bed all the way down, maximum Trendelenburg with both arms tucked.

\-You should closely observe the patient’s status on the bed when going to maximum Trendelenburg.

\-These patients may slide due to gravity.

The OR staff will lower the legs in a lithotomy position before moving the patient into a maximum Trendelenburg.

**IV Access:** Usually, 2 IVs in case one fails.

\-The surgeon will not be happy if you stop the procedure and untuck the patient’s arm to start a new IV.

\-If there is just one IV, make sure it runs well as soon as that arm is tucked.

**BP cuffs:** Bilateral

**IV Fluid:** 1-2 liters of crystalloids are common.

**Neo Drip:** Usually prophylactically in case the patient needs it.

Make sure you connect your Neosynephrine tubing before the arms are tucked.

**Note:** Most patients do not get hypotensive in max Trendelenburg.

**OGT:** Consider it, especially if the patient has gastroparesis.

I’ve seen bile drip down over the patient’s faces during these cases.

**Face Protection:** Yes, a foam donut pillow or cradle is placed over the face.

Some robotic equipment is placed on the drapes and ends up near the patient’s face.

**Eye protection:** Always use goggles.

\-Eye goggles are standard in most facilities.

\-Many facilities have adhesive eye protectors, which are fairly flat vinyl clear shields secured with a foam covering.

\-The device looks like the Lone Ranger’s mask.

**Scleral Edema:** Being in steep Trendelenburg for hours can cause this.

**Corneal abrasions**

\-Some medical facilities have reported higher cornea abrasions with robotic cases.

\-The theory is that scleral edema irritates the patient’s eyes post-operatively, leading to rubbing and scratching their corneas.

\-Some facilities leave the goggles on the patient until they are fully awake in the recovery room.

**Indigo Carmine:** Usually, this drug is administered intravenously at the end of the case to ensure the ureters are not damaged.

The surgeon verifies with a cystoscopy.

**Ventilation Issues:**

\-You may need to change to Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV).

\-Once in steep Trendelenburg, the abdominal contents will drop against the diaphragm, decreasing FRC, compliance, and lung volumes.

\-Due to the elevated peak pressures, volume ventilation may immediately become difficult.

\-The clue will be the alarming of your high peak pressure alarms once the patient is in steep Trendelenburg.

\-This is especially exaggerated with patients with large abdomens.

**EBL:** Usually < 50 mLs

**Possible Complications:**

Bleeding

Vaginal Cuff dehiscence

Bladder injuries

Scleral Edema from steep Trendelenburg.

Corneal Abrasions may happen post-op from the patient rubbing their irritated eyes.

**Protect Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP)**

MAP-ICP (or CVP) = CPP

Normal CPP = 70-110mmHg

In steep Trendelenburg, the CVP or ICP is drastically elevated, so it is obvious here not to permit a low MAP.

A low MAP will increase the risk of stroke in steep Trendelenburg.

CPP < 50mmHg = slowing of the EEG.

CPP 25-40mmHg = flat EEG

CPP < 25mmHg = irreversible brain damage.

**More Notes**

\-Robot-assisted surgery is now becoming more popular in hysterectomies.

\-It allows for excellent visualization of the blood vessels, ureters, and surrounding tissue, as well as improved ability to suture the vagina after removal of the uterus and cervix.

**Advantages of Robotic Hysterectomy**

\-Less blood loss during surgery.

\-Better visualization of the operating site. It uses a magnified 3-D, high-definition image.

\-Less scarring.

\-Less post-operative pain

\-A faster recovery and shorter hospital stay.

\-Fewer post-op complications. Compared to open surgery, minimally invasive hysterectomy procedures, including robotic hysterectomy, are associated with reduced risk of complications, including infection of the incision sites.
