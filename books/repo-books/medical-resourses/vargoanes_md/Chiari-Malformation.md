### Chiari Malformation- Cranial-Cervical Decompression

As simply as possible, this cranio-cervical decompression or Suboccipital Craniotomy is an operation involving the back of the head and top of the neck where the neurosurgeon creates extra room for the bottom part of the brainstem and the top part of the spinal cord to restore CSF flow.  
**Painful procedure?** Yes, and it’s a good idea to frontload your narcotics at the start of the case. We don’t want a decreased RR at the end of the case associated with the narcotics. Surgery is at the brainstem (medulla), and decreased respiratory breathing could be surgically related. Once the patient is breathing at the end of the case, titrate the narcotics to the patient’s respiratory rate and comfort.  
**Indications:** Chiari Malformations (CMs)  
Also known as Arnold-Chiari malformation. CMs consist of 4 syndromes thusly numbered as I, II, III, and IV.

**_Chiari_** Malformation is defined by a volumetrically small posterior cranial fossa, the compartment in the back of the skull, which leads to overcrowding of the cerebellum and brainstem. This causes a blockage of the flow of CSF through the foramen magnum, making it difficult for the fluid to flow around the brain and in and out of the skull. In many cases, the cerebellar tonsils are pushed downward through the foramen magnum.   
  
**Treatment:** A cranial cervical decompression- which consists of a craniectomy, laminectomy, and/or a duraplasty.  
**Craniectomy:** The removal of part of the base of the skull to enlarge the foramen magnum, which is the passageway between the skull and spine, to make more room for the flow of CSF.  
**Laminectomy:** This may also be done. It is the removal of the arch of one or more vertebra, also to open up the posterior fossa space and decrease crowding in the hindbrain area.  
**Duraplasty:** This is also sometimes done, where the dura is opened and replaced with a patch, allowing for extra space for the flow of fluids. During the duraplasty, ask the surgeon if he wants the patient flat. This decreases the CSF leakage and the patient is a less likely candidate for a post op headache.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT. Some of us use an armored ETT since the head may be chin to chest and prone to kinking.  
**Monitoring:** Literature states yes, but usually not. Check ahead of time.  
**Position:** Usually prone, sometimes sitting. When prone, tuck the arms. Make sure you connect your Neosynephrine drip before the arms are tucked.  
**Mayfield Pins:** Yes, so have some extra Propofol and/or Esmolol ready.  
The patient is usually monitored. You will need to check with the monitor tech about paralytics.  
**Operating microscope: Yes**

**A-line:** Yes  
**IV Access:** 1-2 IVs  
**Duration:** 1.5-3 hours  
**EBL**: 25-200mLs  
  
**Possible Complications:**  
Head Bleed or a blot clot (<1:100)  
Stroke (<1:100)  
Wound infection (<1;100)  
CSF leak through the wound (1-2:100). This can result in an infection in the CSF (bacterial meningitis).  
Pseudomeningocoele (1:100). This is where a large bulge develops underneath the skin in the region of the surgical wound, containing CSF.

**More Notes**

These malformations frequently occur in combination with other pathological entities such as myelomeningocele, hydrocephalus, and/or hydrosyringomyelia.

Arnold-Chiari malformations may not cause any problems. Some people, however, can have significant symptoms such as ‘Valsalva’ headaches. In others, an Arnold-Chiari malformation is associated with the development of a spinal cord syrinx.

**What is a syrinx?**  
A syrinx is an abnormal fluid-filled cavity within the spinal cord. The condition is also known as syringomyelia. A spinal cord syrinx is often progressive and over time it enlarges and affects more of the spinal cord causing more and more symptoms. A syrinx can cause irreversible damage to the spinal cord. It can affect the use of the hands, cause disturbing discomfort trunk and limbs, and result in difficulty walking.

**Types of Chiari** **Malformations**

**Type I Chiari:** The cerebellar tonsils are herniated through the foramen magnum. The herniated tissue presses against the brainstem and blocks the normal flow of CSF. Symptoms range from mild to severe.

**Type II:** Resulting from a normal-sized cerebellum developing in an abnormally small posterior fossa with a low tentorial attachment.  
 This type is a complex deformity of the calvarium, dura, and hindbrain, and it is almost always associated with a myelomeningocele.

**Type III:** There is a defect in the back of the head or neck through which the cerebellum and/or brainstem is herniated.  

**Type IV:** The patients usually do not survive past infancy. Severe malformations.

**Associated conditions:**  
Hydrocephalus  
Syringomyelia  
Scoliosis  
Myelodysplasia  
  
**Anatomical Structures at Risk:**  
Cranial nerves III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII  
Brainstem somatosensory pathways  
Spinal cord
