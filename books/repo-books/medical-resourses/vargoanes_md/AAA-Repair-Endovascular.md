AAA Repair- Endovascular (EVAR)     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### AAA Repair - Endovascular (EVAR)

This is the newer form of treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysm that is less invasive than open surgery. We always prefer these over an OPEN AAA repair.  
A stent graft is placed inside of the aortic aneurysm from the groin with a long, very thin delivery catheter. The delivery catheter inserts the stent graft inside the aneurysm.

**Room Set-Up**  
Blood IV set to a blood warmer.  
Vasopressin diluted syringe and a bag (or readily available).  
Epinephrine diluted syringe and a bag (or readily available).  
Nitroglycerine diluted syringe.  
Esmolol on table top (or readily available).  
Syringes available for ACTs.  
I stat machine for ACTs with cartridges.  
2-4 Units of PRBCs in the room.  
Antibiotics-usually Ancef.  
  
If the aneurysm is a slow bleed, some anesthesia providers will prime the Levophed.  
  
**Tips for EVAR (same as an open procedure)  
**Keep the patient warm.  
Keep HR slow (avoid tachycardia).  
Avoid anemia (keep HCT >25-30).  
Prevent HTN (avoid challenging the aneurysm).

  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT or MAC. Theoretically, these patients do not need to be intubated. However, we sometimes intubate these patients in case something goes terribly wrong with the aneurysm. If there is a major hemorrhage, you really don’t want the patient awake.  
A Spinal, epidural or local with MAC is rare.  
**IV Access:** 2 large bore IVs.  
The patient should be type and cross matched with blood available.  
  
**Required Meds:**  
Neosynephrine drip, NTG, Beta Blocker and Heparin.  
Treat this like an aneurysm patient and prevent rapid increases in BP.  
**Type of Patients:** These patients are usually elderly with CAD or cardiac issues like Atrial Fib or a poor Ejection Fraction.  
  
**Is Blood Available in the room?** Yes. I have noticed the experienced CRNAs who have managed many of these cases always request blood available _in the room_ from past experiences. In the room means immediately available, NOT at the blood bank down the hall or on another floor, NOT at the surgery control desk, NOT in the OR refrigerator but in the room in a cooler. I know it is an old rule from the old school but CYA! Have all the blood slips signed and dated. Have everything done except taking the cap off the IV tubing spike so that within 15-30 seconds you are able to start product into your patient.  

**Possible Complications:**  
**Ruptured Aneurysm** - is actually very rare.  
Give blood and vasopressors. Sometimes the surgeon will convert to open.

  
**Local wound complications:** Include groin hematoma, infection, or lymphocele, and the _incidence is 1-10%._  
  
**Access Artery Injury:** Arterial thrombosis, dissection, or pseudo-aneurysm formation can occur. Sometimes the large-catheter system of the stent graft (commonly between 20- and 24-French) is too large for a calcified iliofemoral vessel. In this case, the doctor may abort the EVAR or convert to an iliac conduit.  
**IV Contrast Nephrology:**50 to 100 mL of dye is needed for an EVAR procedure. Contrast-induced nephropathy, resulting in acute renal failure, occurs in 6.7% of cases, according to a nationwide survey by Wald et al.**Ischemic Complications Immediately after EVAR:**Clot formation or clot embolization into the aortic side branches which may lead to colonic, renal, and pelvic ischemia. Adversely, misplacement of the stent graft might occur, thereby partially or completely covering an aortic or iliac side branch. This can result in renal or pelvic ischemia.

**Bowel ischemia:**Occurs in 1 - 3% of all cases after an open aortic aneurysm repair, and the incidence seems to be in the same with an EVAR.

**Spinal Cord Ischemia:**  
Data suggests that this is very rare:  
< 0.21%. While this is not completely understood, atheromatous embolization and interruption of collateral circulation from lumbar and internal iliac arteries together with a variable anatomy of the artery of Adamkiewicz seem to be the most common contributing factors leading to cord ischemia.  
  
**Renal artery occlusion from stenting and retrieval of the stent graft:**  
Not properly placing the stent may occlude one or both renal arteries.

**Causes of both Early and Late Limb Occlusion after EVAR:**  
Limb kinking of the unsupported endograft limb.  
The second generation supported stent grafts perform better than the older unsupported endografts. Most of the thrombotic events occur within the first 2 months after EVAR, and a majority of the underlying causes of limb thrombosis are stent-graft kinking.

**Infection Complications after EVAR:**  
The incidence of aortic stent-graft infection is 0.5 - 1%, and untreated stent-graft infection can result in generalized sepsis and death.  
  
This procedure is usually done in an imaging room under fluoroscopy so you may not have much room and will need a lead vest. Some hospitals prefer these procedures to be done in the operating room in case of a massive hemorrhage. They won’t have the inconvenience of urgently transferring the patient to the operating room. Some hospitals have a “Hybrid Room” room that combines a vascular and an operating room together.
