### Epidural Dose for Complete Dilation

We usually do start an epidural block at complete dilation for imminent vaginal delivery. If you do, it is for strong analgesia while preserving motors for pushing.  
  
**Doses:**  
Lidocaine 1-1.5%, or 2-3% chloroprocaine, 12-15 ml given incrementally with the patient remaining sitting until adequate perineal anesthesia is obtained.
