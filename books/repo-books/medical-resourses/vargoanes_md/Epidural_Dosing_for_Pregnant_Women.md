### Epidural Dosing for Pregnant Women

The spread of epidural or spinal anesthesia is greater in pregnant patients compared to nonpregnant patients. The decreased local anesthetic requirement in pregnancy is attributed to exaggerated spread brought about by mechanical factors. Dilated epidural veins supposedly decrease the diameter of the epidural and subarachnoid space resulting in more extensive longitudinal spread of local anesthetic solution.  
  
It is also suggested that hormonal changes associated with pregnancy alter the basic responsiveness of the nerves to local anesthetics. Thus, caution should be exercised in determining the dosage for regional anesthetic procedures during all stages of pregnancy.
