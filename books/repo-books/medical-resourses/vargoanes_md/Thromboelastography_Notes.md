## Thromboelastography (**TEG**)

Also known as Thromboelastogram

The TEG is a blood test designed to analyze the entire clot formation so we could specifically treat a coagulopathy by replacing the correct blood products needed.  
The TEG also analyzes clot breakdown (fibrinolysis) and can tell us if the patient is hypercoagulated.

**TEGs vs INR and PTT  
**TEGs do not necessarily correlate with the INR and PTT and platelet count. INR, PTT and platelet are often poorer predictors of bleeding and thrombosis.

**TEGs shows the interaction of platelets with the coagulation cascade:**  
Platelet aggregation  
Clot strengthening  
Fibrin cross linking and fibrinolysis

**By utilizing the TEG, we know if we need to administer:  
**FFP  
Cryoprecipitate  
Anti-fibrinolytic  
Thrombolytic drug  
  
Studies clearly show that TEGs decrease the amount of transfused blood products needed to correct a coagulopathy.

**For a proper clot formation, there needs to be:  
**Platelet aggregation  
Clot strengthening  
Fibrin cross linking and fibrinolysis

So basically, TEG analyzes each phase of the above clotting process.

**Drawing blood for the TEE  
**Specimen handling is important for the TEG to be accurate.  
The blood sample must be atraumatic and free of tissue fluid. A blood sample drawn from an A-line is preferred.  
When drawing venous blood, do not use a tourniquet.  
Blood stasis from a tourniquet may lead to inaccurate results.

The blood sample is placed in a vacutainer and becomes citrated.  
  
The TEG analyzer should always be in close proximity to where the sample is collected. The blood should be introduced into the analyzer within 4 minutes.

**The TEG Analyzer  
**The citrated blood in introduced into a cup of the TEG machine.  
This small cup of blood oscillates (not spinning) agitates the blood.  
A torsion pin is submerged in the blood, which is connected to a computer.  
The torsion pin remains motionless until the clotting begins.

The pin motion is displayed graphically by the computer connected to the submerged needle.

As coagulation starts to occur, the pin adheres to the clot and begins to move with it.

The amplitude of pin motion (up and down) is directly proportional to the strength of the clot. As the clot becomes stronger the amplitude becomes greater.

After the clot is formed and the amplitude has leveled off, the amplitude will begin to decrease as the clot begins to break down (fibrinolysis). At this point, the pin begins to slip.
