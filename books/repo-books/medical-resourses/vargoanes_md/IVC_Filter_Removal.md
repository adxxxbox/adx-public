### IVC Filter Removal

\- Under fluoroscopy, the surgeon will thread a catheter through the neck (internal jugular vein) down to the site of the IVC filter.\- A removable IVC filter has a small hook (snare) or knob at one end that enables the catheter to capture the filter, close it, pull it into the catheter, and then withdraw it from the body.  
**Note:**  One older IVC filter brand does not have a hook on the top of it and will need to be retrieved through a groin vessel.  
  
**Anesthesia:** Usually, a MAC with low dose propofol (or infusion) or precedex.  
**Position:** Supine, arms tucked.  
**Duration:** 15 minutes to 1 hour.  
**EBL:** Minimal  
  
**Possible complications:  
**Device fracture and embolization: May migrate to the renal veins, heart and pulmonary vasculature.Excess bleedingInfectionAllergic reactionDamage to the blood vessel at the insertion siteBlockage of blood flow to the vena cavaLeg swellingDamage to other organs from an IVC filter puncture.  
**Extra notes:**  
IVC filters come in permanent or temporary (retrievable) models.  
With new research showing a risk of fractured filters over long periods, raising the risk that a patient will develop a DVT, there has been an increase in the use of retrievable IVC filters.  
  
Retrievable IVC filters may be removed once the risk of a clot traveling to the heart and lungs passes, usually after about six months.  
If blood thinners are unusable and/or the risk of clots continues a removable filter may remain in place for an extended period.
