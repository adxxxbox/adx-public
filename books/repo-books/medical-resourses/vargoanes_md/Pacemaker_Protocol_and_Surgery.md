### Pacemaker Protocol and Surgery

**Electromagnetic interference = EMI  
  
_DO NOT_** _prophylactically apply a magnet on a pacemaker.  
Reprogramming a nondependent patient’s pacemaker to asynchronous mode may cause R on T phenomenon because the pacing impulses compete with the spontaneous rhythm.  
R on T phenomenon may result in ventricular fibrillation._**  
If EMI is below umbilicus?  
**No reprogramming or magnet application necessary.  
Have magnet available.  
  
**If EMI is above umbilicus and patient IS pacemaker dependent?  
**Apply a magnet or have representative program pacemaker to asynchronous mode.  
  
**If EMI is above umbilicus and patient IS NOT pacemaker dependent?  
**Consider applying a magnet or have representative program pacemaker to asynchronous mode if the EMI source is less than 15 cm from the pacemaker.  
Have magnet available.  
**  
Removing the magnet  
**Though it is rare, removing the magnet can cause pacemaker mediated tachycardia (PMT)  
**Treatment:** Re-apply the magnet and remove it again.**Quick review**  
Placing a magnet on a pacemaker will reprogram the pacemaker from “synchronized” to “asynchronized “ rate.  
**Pacemaker asynchronized rate:** The pacemaker will deliver electrical stimuli at a manufacturer selected rate regardless of patients electrical signal from the heart (intrinsic cardiac activity).  
The manufacturer set paced rate during asynchronous mode may different from the patient’s previous set rate. It can be anywhere from 60-100 bpm.The pacemaker is inhibited, so it does not pace, which results in no HR and no BP if the patient was dependent on the pacemaker.  
**  
Electromagnetic interference (EMI) can inhibit the pacemaker  
**When a pacemaker detects electrical activity from the heart it is programmed to NOT PACE while in the synchronized mode. Unfortunately, the pacemaker cannot distinguish an electrical signal between the heart and EMI from a bovie. AN EMI within six inches of the pacemaker can inhibit the pacemaker (NOT pace).  
A pacemaker in the **asynchronized pacemaker mode IS NOT** inhibited by EMI.  
**  
Electromagnetic interference (EMI)  
**Any apparatus that emits radiofrequency waves between 0 and 10 9  Hz can generate EMI and therefore interfere with proper device function.  
The main source of intraoperative EMI we are concerned with is an electrocautery device (bovie) used by the surgeon.  
  
**Electromagnet interference (EMI) source concerns:  
Electrocautery:** Monopolar has a greater risk than bipolar.  
**  
Evoked potential-neuro procedures:**  
MRI  
Radio frequency ablation  
Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy  
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECTs)  
  
EMI close to a pacemaker in a pacemaker dependent patient while in the “synchronous mode” could be disastrous.  
If the electrocautery is too close to the pulse generator of the pacemaker (within 6 inches) the pacemaker may detect the EMI from the bovie and interpret the electric signals as if there was an R wave. The pacemaker is inhibited and will no longer pace.  
This may result in profound bradycardia or asystole for a pacemaker dependent patient.  
The application of a magnet to convert the pacemaker to asynchronous mode prevents this from happening.  
  
**More notes  
**A “CIED” is an acronym for any Cardiovascular Implantable Electronic Device. It is a broad term that encompasses pacemakers for bradycardia, Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) for tachyarrhythmia management, and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) devices for systolic dysfunction with a conduction delay.**  
  
Most patients with CIEDs do NOT need a new preoperative evaluation by the CIED management**  
The HRS/ASA consensus statement concludes that most patients with CIEDs do not need a new preoperative evaluation by the CIED management team (physicians and other health care professionals who monitor the who monitor the CIED function of the patient) because, most of the time, the pertinent information will be available in the notes from the CIED clinic.  
**  
Patients usually carry a Pacer or AICD card**  
This card should give you details of the device and its manufacturer, model number, serial number, implanting hospital, follow-up hospital, date of/reason for the implant.  
If the patient can’t find the card, you can ask a family member, or get an X-ray of the device and see the make on the circuit board. Moreover, you can see the leads and tell what the device is.  
  
The easiest way to find out what the device is, call one of the manufacturers below. They are open 24/7/365.  
If you call and identify the patient, they give you the needed information.  
Thy may also will send a representative.
