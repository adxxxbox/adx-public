Nissen Fundoplication     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Nissen Fundoplication

**Indication:** GERD, Hiatal Hernia or Barrett's esophagitis.

The gastric fundus or upper part of the stomach is wrapped or folded around the lower end of the esophagus and stitched in place, reinforcing the closing function of the lower esophageal sphincter. This prevents the stomach from sliding back up into the chest.

Mortality rate < 1%. Vomiting is almost impossible post operatively. Some patients have said that eructation, also known medically as ructus, or more commonly known as burping or belching is difficult to impossible following a Nissen. This is a big complaint for many, although >90% of patients are highly satisfied on their 8 to 10 year follow-up.

The surgeon stands between the patient's legs while the camera operator stands to the patient's right and the second assistant assumes a position on the patient's left.

**Bougie Insertion**  
During the case, you will be asked to place a large bougie down the esophagus. Make sure you lubricate it. The bougie is to distend the esophagus and aid the assessment of the fundoplication and hiatus.  
**Warning**: DO NOT force the bougie. If there is any resistance, inform the surgeon and let him insert it. CRNAs have been named in malpractice suits for the perforation of the anterior esophagus during resistant insertions, even when the surgeon asked them to keep trying.  
**Laparoscopic**: Usually.  
Duration: 1-2 hours  
**Anesthetic**: General/ETT. Consider RSI, since these are serious GERD patients.  
**Muscle Relaxation**: Yes.  
**Position:** Modified lithotomy position, 1 or 2 arms out and reverse Trendelenburg.  
**OGT:** Yes to initially decompress the stomach. Then pull it out.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
**EBL**: Minimal  
**Antiemetics:** Yes, you need to maximize these to prevent PONV or retching.  
**_Retching and vomiting can damage the healing wrap postoperatively. The patient may need to return to surgery. That is why it is so important to pretreat to prevent nausea._**

I know of one surgeon who demands a TIVA for his Nissen procedures. He feels it was the inhalation agent that caused his patient to become nauseated and needed to return to surgery.

  
**Possible Complications  
**Pneumothorax: One study showed that 7-46% incidence of pneumothorax with patients undergoing a laparoscopic fundoplication.  
It is suggested to increased PEEP and minute ventilation to reinflate the lung.  
The increase in pleural pressure will decrease the pressure gradient from abdomen to pleural cavity and possibly to seal a tear if one occurs.  
  
Hemorrhage.  
Perforated esophagus.  
Difficulty swallowing because the stomach is wrapped too high on the esophagus or is wrapped too tightly.  
The esophagus sliding out of the wrapped portion of the stomach, so that the LES valve is no longer supported.  
Heartburn that returns.  
Bloating and discomfort from gas buildup because the person is not able to burp.  
Excess gas.  
Risks of anesthesia.  
Infection.

The fundoplication procedure cannot be reversed, and in some cases it may not be possible to relieve the symptoms of these complications, even with a second surgery.
