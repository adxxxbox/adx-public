### Oral Cavity –Excision of Lesion

Many soft tissue lesions may exist in the mouth. Lesions can be on the tongue, lips, gingiva, soft and hard palate, and floor of the mouth (Ludwig’s Angina).  
Many of these procedures are for cancer. Squamous cell cancer is the most popular mouth CA (just like tongue cancer).

**Pre-op**: Assess the airway and find out where the lesion is.  
Find out from the surgeon if he/she wants you to orally intubate and secure the ETT on the opposite side of the lesion or nasally intubate.  
**Anesthetic:** General/ Oral or Nasal intubation.  
LTA Kit: Recommended.  
**Muscle Relaxant:** Not usually needed, but check with the surgeon beforehand.  
**Antisialogogue:** Yes, Robinul.  
**Antiemetics:** Yes, Zofran and Decadron.  
**Throat pack:** yes.  
**Position**: Supine and the arms tucked. Sometimes one arm is out. Sometimes the bed is rotated 90 degrees.  
**Duration:** 15-90 minutes.  
**Neo Drip:** Arms are usually tucked and it would be hard to add one later. So you may want to consider having one connected at distal IV connection port. If one arm is out, than you can connect one later if needed. Remember, if they are not relaxed, you will have to keep them deep and that drops their BP.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable. Make sure the IV runs well after the arm is tucked.  
**EBL**: Depends on the lesion and surgeon.  
**Emergence:** Goal is a smooth wakeup, avoiding bucking. Consider an awake extubation. It will depend on the intubation, patient size, procedure, length of anesthetic, et.al.  
Consider a Nasal airway. Humidified oxygen is administered post-operatively.
