### Ketamine Contraindications and Warnings

**Hemodynamic instability:** Monitor vital signs and cardiac function during ketamine administration.  
**  
Cardiovascular disease:**  
**Use with caution in patients with:**  
Coronary artery disease (especially not beta-blocked)  
Catecholamine depletion  
Hypertension  
Tachycardia**  
  
Hypersensitive airways:  
**\- Increased tenacious secretion may cause bronchospasm or laryngospasm.  
\- Procedural sedation for major procedures involving the posterior pharynx (e.g., endoscopy).  
\- Patients with a history of airway instability, tracheal surgery, or tracheal stenosis.  
\- Upper respiratory diseases  
\- In the presence of airway infection, especially in pediatrics.  
  
**Dependence:**  
May cause dependence (withdrawal symptoms on discontinuation) and tolerance with prolonged use.  
  
**Patients more prone to emergence delirium:  
**Ages 16 to 65  
Female gender  
High doses greater than 2 mg/kg IV  
History of personality problems or frequent dreaming.  
**Less common in patients:** < 16 years of age and > 65 years of age, and when given IM  
  
**Patients with increased ocular pressure:**  
\- Use caution in patients with increased intraocular pressure (IOP).  
\- Consider avoiding in patients with an open eye injury or other ophthalmologic disorder where an increase in IOP would be detrimental.  
**  
Patients with Porphyria:  
**\- The use of ketamine in patients with porphyria is a relative contraindication due to the enhanced sympathomimetic effect produced by ketamine. (ACEP \[Green 2011\]).  
**  
Thyroid disorders:  
**\- Patients with a thyroid disorder or receiving a thyroid medication a relative contraindication due to enhanced sympathomimetic effect produced by ketamine.  
  
**< 3 years of age and third trimester of pregnancy:  
**\- This is the time of rapid brain growth and synaptogenesis.  
\- The repeated or lengthy exposure to sedatives or anesthetics during surgery/procedures may have detrimental effects on the children or fetus’ brain development.  
\- It may contribute to various cognitive and behavioral problems.  
  
**Contraindications of ketamine:**  
\- In patients for whom a significant elevation of blood pressure would be a severe hazard.  
\- Known hypersensitivity to ketamine or any excipient.  
  
**Ketamine in infants < 3 months of age is an absolute contraindication.**  
\- The American College of Emergency Physicians considers the use of ketamine in infants < 3 months of age to be an absolute contraindication due to the higher risk of airway complications (ACEP \[Green 2011\]).  
  
**Allergic reactions to ketamine are very rare.  
**Ketamine does not evoke the release of histamine and rarely, if ever, causes allergic reactions.
