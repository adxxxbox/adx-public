### Total Spinal vs High Spinal

**High Spinal (High Block):** Clinical block well above the level required for surgical anesthesia, when the spread of the local anesthetic affects the spinal nerves above T4. The results of a high spinal depends upon the nerves involved.  
**Total Spinal** (intracranial): A block involving the cervical spine and above - the brain and cranial nerves. This results in apnea, loss of and possibly cardiac arrest. The patient will need intubated and resuscitated for a few hours until the local anesthetic wears off.
