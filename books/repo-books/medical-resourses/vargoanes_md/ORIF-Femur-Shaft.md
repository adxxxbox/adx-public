ORIF of Femur     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### ORIF of Femur

The femur is the longest and strongest bone in your body. Because the femur is so strong, it usually takes a lot of force to break it. Car crashes, for example, are the number one cause of femur fractures in frontal impact MVAs.

These are either high-energy injuries in young men or low-energy injuries in elderly women. A lower-force incident, such as a fall from standing, may cause a femoral shaft fracture in an older person who has weaker bones. Often can occur when an elderly person missteps coming down a set of stairs or a small step ladder from changing a light bulb. Primary nerve injury following femoral shaft fracture is rare.

**Possible methods of repair:**  
External Fixator.

ORIF (plates & screws, fixed angle devices, locking plates).

Flexible nails.

Locked rigid nail.

Percutaneous Pinning.

**Anesthetic: General/ETT**  
Regional: Spinal is optional. Consider Propofol or a little Ketamine for positioning of the spinal due to pain.  
**Position:** Supine, usually on a fracture table. The arm of the unaffected side is extended and padded. The arm of the affected side is usually flexed across their abdomen and taped or otherwise secured so the arm won’t move into the surgical field.  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours.  
**Neo Drip:** Yes, especially if a spinal is done.  
**EBL:** 50-150mLs  
**IV Access:** 18 or 20G. Avoid the AC site if the arms will be flexed and taped over their abdomen.

**Complications:**

Bleeding  
Infection

Malunion

Nonunion

Loss of reduction of fracture.  
Infection  
Wound complications in patients with diabetes.

DVTs/PE
