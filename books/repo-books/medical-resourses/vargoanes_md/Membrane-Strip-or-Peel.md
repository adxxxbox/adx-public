First the vitreous is removed by vitrectomy. The epiretinal membrane is then peeled off and removed. The vitreous is replaced with clear fluid.  
**Anesthetic:** MAC with Retrobulbar block.  
**Duration:** 30-90 minutes. Depends on the surgeon and cause of the condition.  
**EBL**: Minimal  
IV Access: 22G is acceptable. A 500mL NS bag with micro drip tubing is popular.  
**Position**: Supine with arms tucked and the patient remains on the same stretcher. Make sure the ETCO2 NC is looped away from the surgical eye. The stretcher is parked 90-180 degrees away from you (unless you are starting out as a general).
