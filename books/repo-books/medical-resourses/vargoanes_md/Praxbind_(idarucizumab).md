### Praxbind (idarucizumab)

Praxbind **®** (idarucizumab)The antidote for oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran (Pradaxa®).**  
  
Praxbind Mechanism of Action  
**Binds to dabigatran and its acylglucuronide metabolites with a 350-fold higher affinity of dabigatran to thrombin, neutralizing their anticoagulant effect immediately after administration.**  
  
Indications of Praxbind:**  
**In patients treated with Pradaxa ® when reversal of the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran is needed:**  
Emergency surgery/urgent procedures.  
Life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding.  
  
**Dose  
Praxbind® (idarucizumab) Dose:** 5 g IV x 1, administered as 2 consecutive IV infusions of 2.5 gram vials over 5 minutes each.  
The second 2.5 gram vial must be administered within 15 minutes of the first vial.  
Recheck labs.  
  
**Thromboembolic risk with dabigatran reversal  
**Dabigatran-treated patients have underlying diseases predisposing them to thromboembolic events.  
Reversing dabigatran therapy exposes patients to thrombotic risk.  
Consider resuming anticoagulant therapy as soon as medically appropriate.**  
  
Re-elevation of coagulation parameters is needed  
**Elevated coagulation parameters (e.g., activated partial thromboplastin time or ecarin clotting time) have been observed in a limited number of Praxbind®-treated patients.If reappearance of clinically relevant bleeding together with elevated coagulation parameters is observed, or if patients requiring a second emergency surgery/urgent procedure have elevated coagulation parameters, an additional full dose may be considered.**  
  
Hypersensitivity Reactions**  
Risk of hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactoid reaction) to idarucizumab or excipients needs to be weighed cautiously against the potential benefit. If serious allergic reaction occurs, immediately discontinue Praxbind® and institute appropriate treatment.  
  
**Risk in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance  
**Praxbind® contains 4 g sorbitol as an excipient.When prescribing in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance, consider the total daily amount of sorbitol/fructose consumption from all sources, as serious adverse reactions (e.g., hypoglycemia, hypophosphatemia, metabolic acidosis, increase in uric acid, acute liver failure, and death) may occur.**  
  
Pregnancy and Lactation**  
May be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.  
Caution should be exercised when Praxbind® is administered to a nursing woman.  
  
**ADVERSE REACTIONS  
**Headaches (5%)  
Constipation (7%)  
Nausea (5%)
