Similar to a Rectocele Repair or Posterior Colporrhaphy.  
This procedure can be combined with an Anterior repair.  
 

**Rectocele:** A protrusion of the rectum into the vagina. This procedure is basically repairing the hernia of the wall in between the rectum and vagina. Similar to an Anterior repair (repair of cystocele) except that a cystocele is the protrusion of the bladder into the vagina.  
There are many ways to perform a posterior repair, but a common method is by an incision being made along the center of the posterior wall of the vagina starting at the entrance and finishing near the top of the vagina.
