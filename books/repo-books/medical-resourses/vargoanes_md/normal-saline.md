# Normal Saline

**Normal Saline (NSS, NS, 0.9% Sodium Chloride)**  
Classification  
Isotonic volume expander.  
Electrolyte replacement.  
Contains 9 g/L NaCl (154 mEq/L of Na and 154 mEq/L of Cl).  
Isotonic osmolarity of 308 mOsmol/L.  
pH is 5.0 (4.5-7.0).  
**Kinetics (IV)**  
  
**Onset:** Immediate  
**Peak:** Immediate  
**Duration:** Until renal clearance occurs.  
When given in large volumes, it produces dilutional HYPERchloremic acidosis because of its high sodium and chloride content.  
It also dilutes serum HCO3.  
**Indications:**  
Hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis  
Hyperchloremic patients in shock  
Hyponatremic patients in shock  
Diluting PRBCs prior to transfusion  
Renal patients  
Diabetic patients  
A 500mL bag of NS with a mircro drip is standard for a dialysis patient having surgery.  
Used to be standard for diabetic patients. Not so much anymore.  
**Precautions**  
It should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with congestive heart failure, severe renal insufficiency and in clinical states in which there exists edema with sodium retention.  
In patients with diminished renal function, administration of Normal Saline may result in sodium retention.  
**Adverse Reactions**  
Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response, infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection, extravasation, and hypervolemia.  
**Interactions/Compatibility/Stability**  
Compatible with most, if not all, EMS medications. Check individual medications before administration.  
**Special Considerations**  
Be aware that hypertonic (1.8%) and hypotonic (0.45%) saline solutions exist. Ensure appropriate concentration before use.
