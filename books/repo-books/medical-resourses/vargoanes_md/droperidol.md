# Droperidol

**Droperidol (Inapsine)**  
This drug used to be very popular until it received a "Black Box" warning for being associated with cases of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes. It is slowly coming back. Zofran has a similar warning and we still use it.  
**Class:** Butyrophenone (Haldol is also one).  
**Category:** Anesthesia adjunct, antiemetic and antipsychotic.  
Dopamine Antagononist-avoid with Parkinson's.  
This drug not only is a great aniemetic, but has great sedation properties.  
**When to dose:** most often pre-op or with induction.  
**Adult Dosage:**  
**Popular dose:** 0.625-1.25mg IV  
**Max Dose:** 2.5mg IV  
Additional 1.25 mg doses may be given to achieve the desired effect.  
**Geriatric:** lower doses  
**Peds:** (Ages 2-12) Max is 0.1mg/kg  
**Onset:** 3-10 minutes  
**Peak:** within 30 minutes  
**Duration:** 2-4 hours  
**Ventilation:** It augments  
**Indications:** PONV when other antiemetics have failed.  
**MOA:** not known.  
**Theory:** it may bind to postsynaptic GABA receptors.  
Binding of GABA receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) may be the mechanism for the antiemetic effect.  
Neuroleptaanalgesia-Preoperatively, when given with Fentanyl , can cause a trance-like (cataleptic) immobility in an outward tranquil dissociated and indiffent to the exernal surrounding.  
It does not enhance analgesia of Fentanyl but can prolong it.  
**CNS Effects:**  
An outwardly calming effect may mask an over overwhelming fear of surgery.  
Akathisia-A restlessness in the legs can occur.  
Extrapyramidal reactions: seen in 1% of cases. Can be treated with Benadryl.  
Not amnestic.  
**Other Effects:**  
Produces mild alpha-adrenergic blockade.  
Peripheral vascular dilatation- can cause hypotension.  
Reduces the pressor effect of epinephrine.  
It may reduce the incidence of epinephrine-induced arrhythmias. but it does not prevent other cardiac arrhythmias.  
Droperidol potentiates other CNS depressants.  
**Ventilation:** It augments the ventilator response evoked by arterial hypoxemia by blocking the action of the inhibitory neurotransmitter dopamine at the carotid body. So it's a great preoperative drug for COPDers who depend on the carotid body drive to prevent hypoventilation.  
**Droperidol and Propofol**  
It may compete with propofol for binding sites in the chemoreceptor trigger zone; concurrent use of propofol and droperidol to control nausea and vomiting is less effective than using propofol alone.  
**Droperidol and Epinephrine** It may antagonize the pressor effects of epinephrine, and may trigger a hypotensive episode.  
**Contraindications:**  
With known or suspected QT prolongation (i.e., QTc interval greater than 440 msec for males or 450 msec for females). This would include patients with congenital long QT syndrome.  
Patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug.  
Droperidol is not recommended for any use other than for the treatment of perioperative nausea and vomiting in patients for whom other treatments are ineffective or inappropriate.  
**Warnings** Based on these reports, all patients should undergo a 12-lead ECG prior to administration of INAPSINE (droperidol) to determine if a prolonged QT interval (i.e., QTc greater than 440 msec for males or 450 msec for females) is present. If there is a prolonged QT interval, INAPSINE (droperidol) should NOT be administered.  
I have never seen any anesthesia provider get a 12 lead just to give a low dose.
