### Dopamine (Intropin) Pharmacology and Notes

**Refractory CHF:** initial dose: 0.5 to 2 mcg/kg/min.**For Renal:** (1-5 mcg/kg/min) increases urine output per dopamine receptors.**For Cardiac:** (2-10 mcg/kg/min) increases systolic and pulse pressure via myocardial contractility (usually start at 5mcg/kg/min) via beta 1 receptors.**For Cardiac and Vasoconstriction:** (10-20 mcg/kg/min)  
  
**Cardiac life support** (initial): 2 to 5 mcg/kg/min. Titrate to effect.  
Increase by 1-4 mcg/kg/minute at 10 to 30 minute intervals.  
If dosages >20-30 mcg/kg/minute are needed, consider a norepinephrine (Levophed) or Epinephrine drip, a more direct-acting pressor, may be more beneficial.  
0.5 to 2 mcg/kg/min: dopaminergic receptors.  
2-10-dopa/beta receptors.  
\>10-primarily alpha receptors.  
  
**Dopamine (Intropin) Notes  
**Precursor of norepinephrine; stimulates dopaminergic, alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors (little or no beta-2 effect). Comes pre-mixed.  
400mg/500ml Bag (800mcg/ml)  
800mg/250ml Bag (3200 mcg/ml)  
400mg/250ml Bag (1600mcg/ml)  
  
**Low dose: 2-5mcg/kg/min** \- For Renal. Causes more splanchnic dilatation, improving renal blood flow (urine output) by stimulating dopamine receptors.  
  
**Medium dose: 5-10mcg/kg/min** \- Cardiac: beta 1 receptors start to predominate.  
  
**High dose: 10-20mcg/kg/min.** \- Vasoconstriction (alpha 1) becomes more prevalent Always use a large-bore IV, preferably a central line, to avoid infiltration which results in extravasation necrosis (treated with phentolamine). **_NOTE: Phentolamine may not be available at all insitutions._**  
  
**Metabolism  
**Metabolized in the liver, kidney, and plasma by MAO and catechol-O-methyltransferase to inactive compounds  
25% of dose is taken up in the adrenergic nerve terminals where it is hydrolyzed to norepinephrine.  
  
**Elimination** Half-life: 2 mins, 80% excreted in urine within 24 hours.  
**Onset:** Within 5 min.**Duration:** Less than 10 min.**  
  
Adverse effects  
**Infiltrated IV results in extravasation necrosis (treat with phentolamine).  
Asthma exacerbation.  
Hypotension.  
Tachycardia.  
Nausea.  
Vomiting.  
Vasoconstriction.  
Conduction abnormalities.  
  
**Contraindications**  
Pheochromocytoma (Adrenal Gland Tumor).  
Allergy to any ingredient in dopamine.  
Currently taking droxidopa.  
History of having taken furazolidone or a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor (e.g. phenelzine) within the past 21 days.  
Uncorrected tachyarrhythmias.  
Ventricular fibrillation.  
Allergy to corn/corn products (dextrose solutions).  
Uncorrected tachyarrhythmias.  
Ventricular fibrillation.  
  
**Dopamine infiltration treatment**  
To prevent sloughing and necrosis in ischemic areas, the area should be infiltrated as soon as possible with 10 to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate.
