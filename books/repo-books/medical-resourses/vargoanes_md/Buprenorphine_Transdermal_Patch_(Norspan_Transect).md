### **Buprenorphine Transdermal Patch (Norspan, Transect)**

**Buprenorphine:** BUP

BUP is a partial opioid agonist that strongly binds to opioid receptors in the brain, which can displace other opioids used for anesthesia.

**Indication:** Chronic pain (not for acute pain)

**Class:** opiate analgesics

BUP is a Schedule III opioid that is effective for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD).

**Class:** opiate analgesics

BUP is 30 times more potent than morphine and provides effective analgesia at low to moderate doses.

Therapeutic efficacy is achieved with daily doses of 0.5 to 2 mg, making it 25 to 50 times more potent as an analgesic per milligram than morphine.

**Mostly a mu agonist:**

BUP is a high-affinity, long-acting, partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and antagonist at the kappa opioid receptor.

Owing to its kappa receptor antagonism, BUP is also beneficial in treating refractory depression.

Due to its tight binding and low intrinsic activity at the mu-opioid receptor, it is beneficial regarding opioid craving and withdrawal.

It poses low risks for accidental overdose and respiratory depression.

BUP **is mostly a mu agonist.**

BUP has high lipophilicity and high affinity for, and slow dissociation from, the μ-

In addition, BUP exerts agonist activity at the delta opioid receptor, the effects of which are not fully understood. opioid receptor.

**Three types of Buprenorphine Transdermal Patch preparations:**

**3-day patch (Transtec®):**

Will be released at one of three defined rates: 35 mcg/h, 52.5 mcg/h, or 70 mcg/h.

**Dose effectiveness:** Reached within 12 to 24 hours and maintained at a constant dose rate control for 96 hours.

**Low-dose 7-day buprenorphine patches (Norspan®):**

Available in strengths of 5 mcg/h, 10 mcg/h, or 20 mcg/h, respectively.

Steady-state is achieved by day 3 following the first application.

After removal of the Norspan transdermal patch, approximately 50% buprenorphine concentration remains after 12 to 24 hours.

**Buprenorphine and aloe vera:** Used in Germany

**Caution with medications that prolong QT intervals:**

Ondansetron

Amiodarone

Erythromycin

Dofetilide

Disopyramide

Mesoridazine

Quinidine

Cisapride

Haldol

Dronedarone

Pimozide

Tacrolimus

Safinamide

Samidorphan

Thioridazine

**Metabolism:**

Buprenorphine is N-dealkylated to norbuprenorphine, mainly in the liver by CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6, but also by the gut wall.

_For drug interaction purposes, the inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A metabolism can alter serum concentrations of drugs dependent upon the CYP3A subfamily of liver enzymes, including CYP3A4, for elimination or activation._

**CYP:** cytochrome P450.

**Active metabolites:** norbuprenorphine and several glucuronides of less importance.

**CYP3A4 inducers** will elevate the serum buprenorphine levels.

ritonavir

amiodarone

ketoconazole

erythromycin

grapefruit and star-fruit juice, will thereby elevate the serum buprenorphine level

**CYP3A4** inhibitors prolong QT interval.

Cisapride

Dronedarone

Pimozide

**Possible side-effects/complications**

Symptoms related to prolonged QT interval: dizziness, palpitations, dizziness, syncope, dysrhythmia

**Other:**

Difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep

Headache

Dry mouth

Stomach pain

Skin irritation, itching, swelling, or redness in the area where you wore the patch

Difficulty breathing or swallowing

Shortness of breath

Agitation

Hallucinations

Fever

Sweating

Confusion

Shivering

Severe muscle stiffness or twitching

Loss of coordination

Diarrhea or constipation

Nausea

Vomiting

Loss of appetite

Weakness

Irregular menstruation

Decreased sexual desire

Chest pain

Swelling of your face, tongue or throat

Rash

Hives

Itching

**Breastfeeding:** Buprenorphine can cause shallow breathing, difficulty or noisy breathing, confusion, more than usual sleepiness, trouble breastfeeding, or limpness in breastfed infants. may decrease fertility in men and women

**Elimination:**

Eliminated predominantly via the gastrointestinal tract (for almost two-thirds), with the feces containing mainly unchanged buprenorphine, and only to a lesser extent via the urine (remaining one-third), which contains conjugates of the mother compound and norbuprenorphine.

**Renal insufficiency:**

Renal impairment shouldn’t increase plasma accumulation of the mother compound.

But renal insufficiency could still lead to an increased plasma concentration of norbuprenorphine as the majority of is excreted via the urine.
