## Fluid Management with Burn Patients

_Providing safe and effective anesthesia for burn surgery requires a fundamental understanding of the pathophysiological consequences of major burn injury._

**Fluid management varies with medical facilities**  
Fluid management is guided by a handful of formulas that estimate initial fluid requirements based on burn severity and body weight.  
  
In estimating the amount of fluid required, the **size** of the burn is more important than the depth. Burn injuries greater than 15-20% are associated with significant fluid shifts, burn wound edema, and shock warranting increased management.  
  
To facilitate resuscitation, a minimum of 2 large bore IV catheters should be placed, preferably through unburned tissue.  
  
Fluid formulas provide a starting point for resuscitation and are particularly useful to providers who do not routinely care for burn-injured patients. Continuous reassessment and collaboration with burn team is necessary to guide effective resuscitation.  
  
The Parkland Formula is the most widely used resuscitation formula in the world, though only the initial 24-hour crystalloid portion tends to be followed closely.

**4 x (% of burn) x kg = fluid resuscitation to be given over 24h**  
The first 50% of crystalloid should be given the first 8 hours  
The second 50% administered over the next 16 hours

**Actual fluid rates should be continuously adjusted to maintain urine output of:**  
Adults: 0.5 to 1.0 mL/kg/h  
Children: 1.0 to 1.5 mL/kg/h

Patients who tend to require more fluid than predicted by formulas include children and patients with inhalation injuries or additional traumas.

**Isotonic crystalloids**  
The fluid loss from burns is predominantly from the extracellular compartment. Therefore, isotonic crystalloids have traditionally been the fluid of choice, especially during the initial 24-hour post-burn period when capillary permeability is maximal.

All fluids carry advantages and disadvantages. High volumes of crystalloid therapies are associated with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and hypercoagulation. Ringer’s Lactate has been associated with increasing neutrophil activity. All is all, careful monitoring and reassessment is necessary pending the magnitude of injury.

**Colloids are Controversial**  
The use of colloids (albumin), for volume replacement remains controversial despite theoretical benefits over crystalloids including replenishment of plasma proteins and greater longevity in the intravascular space.  
  
Colloids have been found to reduce overall fluid requirements and improve patient hemodynamic stability when compared to crystalloids, even within the initial 24-hour post-burn period, yet an increase in patient survival has **not** been demonstrated, and their use in many US treatment centers remains limited.  
  
Preparations that combine crystalloid with albumin to decrease fluid requirements and avoid adverse effects associated with over resuscitation such as abdominal compartment syndrome have been documented.  
  
Because virtually all fluids have potential for both benefit and detriment, the best resuscitation protocol will ultimately provide a combination of fluids with properties best suited for an individual patient's unique physiological and pathophysiological needs.

**Electrical Burn**  
Patients suffering from electrical burn are associated with a high incidence of musculoskeletal injury and renal failure. Electrical burn patients are highly vulnerable to myoglobinuria and the associated renal sequelae even post-fluid resuscitation. These patients will need additional vigilant monitoring for this condition during resuscitation and recovery.
