Streptokinase (Streptase, Kabikinase)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Streptokinase (Streptase, Kabikinase)

**Drug Class:** Thrombolytic  
Used to breakdown clots in some cases of myocardial infarctions, pulmonary embolism, and arterial thromboembolism.  
The type of heart attack it is used in is an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).  
A sterile, purified preparation of a bacterial protein elaborated by group C _(beta)_ \-hemolytic streptococci.  
  
**Indications**  
**Streptokinase, is indicated for the lysis of thrombi for:**  
Acute Evolving Transmural Myocardial Infarction:  
Pulmonary Embolism  
Deep Vein Thrombosis  
Arterial Thrombosis or Embolism  
Occlusion of Arteriovenous Cannulae  
  
**Mechanism of Action  
**Streptokinase, acts with plasminogen to produce an "activator complex" that converts plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin dissolves fibrin linked clots.  
  
Clot lysis elevates fibrin split/degradation products that also have an anticoagulant effect (inhibits platelet aggregation). Thrombolytic therapy may maximally depress fibrinogen and plasminogen for 5 hours following therapy and remain depressed for 27 hours.  
  
**Monitor:** plasma fibrinogen may be useful.  
Bleeding time and fibrin/fibrin degradation product (FDP/fdp) titer.  
May increase PT, PTT, and INR.  
May decrease hematocrit  
  
_Although streptokinase is relatively selective for clot-associated fibrin, it can produce systemic lytic state and undesirable bleeding._  
  
**Contraindications:  
**Recent surgery (10 days)  
GI bleeding (3 months)  
History of hypertension (diastolic > 110 mmHg)  
Pregnancy aortic dissection |  
Active bleeding or hemorrhagic disorder.  
Previous cerebrovascular accident  
Acute pericarditis or active intracranial process  
  
**After Streptokinase is Discontinued**  
The hyperfibrinolytic effect disappears within a few hours.  
  
A prolonged thrombin time may persist for up to 24 hours due to the decrease in plasma levels of fibrinogen and an increase in the amount of circulating fibrinogen.  
  
Depending upon the dosage and duration of infusion of Streptokinase, the thrombin time will decrease to less than two times the normal control value within 4 hours, and return to normal by 24 hours.  
  
Thrombolytic therapy will maximally depress fibrinogen and plasminogen for 5 hours following therapy and remain depressed for 27 hours.  
  
**Metabolism  
**No metabolites identified.  
  
**Elimination  
**Streptokinase is cleared by the liver. The t½ is approximately 23 min (for activator complex).  
  
There are no recommendations for removal of analgesic catheters for patients receiving fibrinolytic/thrombolytic medications, but fibrinogen levels (later factor to recover) can provide relative guidance on thrombolytic effect and timing of catheter removal.

last dose and neuraxial procedure | Can it be given with  
epidural catheter in place? | Restart after  
neuraxial procedure and/or  
catheter insertion | Restart after  
catheter removal |

| Insufficient data  
48 hours if clotting studies and fibrinogen are normal.  
  
(2 day minimum is based on prolonged plasminogen  
depression for 27 hours.  
  
Note: Fibrinogen is one the last  
clotting factors to recover)  
  
Treatment for depletion of fibrinogen with a major bleed:  
Administer cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate. | No | Insufficient data.  
Not until fibrinogen  
level has recovered. | Insufficient data.  
Not until fibrinogen  
level has recovered. |

**Restart medication after procedure:** 2 day minimum.  
**Remove catheter after last administration:** No recommendations.  
  
_Clots are not stable for 10 days post thrombolytic therapy._  
  
_A recent consensus statement by ASRA and ESRA_ _to initiate Streptase (_ _thrombolytic therapy)_ _after neuraxial/deep-PNB procedures and surgery,_ _has been reduced to a_ _2-day minimum and perform neuro assessments Q 2 hours x 2 days. The 2-day minimum is based on prolonged plasminogen depression of 27 hours.
