### Thoracic Spine Surgery

Surgery of the vertebrae from T-1 to T-12.    
Injuries to the thoracic spine are less common than the cervical and lumbar, because the thoracic region has the added protection of the rib cage. The techniques and equipment used in thoracic spine surgery is very similar to that of the lumbar spine. The anesthetic is not much different than a lumbar procedure.  
**Anesthetic:** General / ETT.

**Muscle Relaxation:** Usually, but just check with the surgeon.

**Duration:** 1-3 hours: it depends how many levels are being done.  
**EBL:** Depends on the surgeon.  
**IV Access:** 18G is common. Make sure the IV is not in the AC site. It may kink when the arms are flexed 90 degrees. It usually is not an issue if the arms are tucked.  
**Antibiotics:** Usually Ancef, unless contraindicated.  
**Lower Body Warming Blanket:** Yes  
**Neuro Monitoring:** Usually not.  
**Position:** Prone. Arms out or tucked; the position depends on the levels being worked on.  
Before you log roll the patient onto the OR table, make sure you have a foam cradle or Prone View on the patient’s face before you roll the patient over. Most of us also place some eye goggles over the patient’s eyes. Many of us use a flex accordion type anesthesia circuit extender for the ETT. Reconnect the ventilator tubing and monitors. Re-check breath sounds!  
  
Sometimes the surgeon prefers a cushioned horseshoe device instead of the prone view. It depends on the surgical levels and the surgeon’s own personal preferences.

Eyes, ears, and nose should be checked to assure that these areas are free from pressure. The ETT should be free without kinking or undue traction, and you should be able to visually see or have access to check all connections. Make sure the chest rolls are in their proper place and the shoulders are padded.

**Possible Complications:**

Dural tear

Nerve root damage

Bleeding

Infection
