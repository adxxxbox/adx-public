## **Cranioplasty**

Cranioplasty is the surgical repair of a natural bone defect in the skull, or that’s left behind after a previous operation or injury.  
There are different kinds of cranioplasties, but most involve restoring the contour of the skull with the original skull piece (flap) or a synthetic custom contoured graft.

**The custom contoured grafts placed on the skull can be:**  
Titanium (plate or mesh)  
Synthetic bone substitute  
Acrylic (prefabricated or molded at the time of surgery)

**Indications for Cranioplasty**  
**Protection:** In certain places, a cranial defect can leave the brain vulnerable to damage  
(soft spot-unprotected).

**Function:** Cranioplasty may improve neurological function for some patients.

**Aesthetics:** A noticeable skull defect can affect a patient’s appearance and confidence.

**Headaches:** Cranioplasty can reduce headaches due to previous surgery or injury.

**Surgical Procedure  
**The surgeon will carefully open the scalp and gently remove a part of the cranium or expose the ‘soft spot (the open portion with no bone covering from a previous craniotomy). The surgeon will then expose and gently separate that area into layers thereby protecting the dura, which covers the brain.  
The edges of surrounding bone are cleaned, and the surface is prepared so the original bone flap (that has been stored in a freezer) or synthetic implant can be positioned properly. The original bone flap or synthetic graft is then secured to the surrounding cranial bones with screws, plates or both.  
Once the bone or implant in place, bleeding is controlled, and the surgeon moves the scalp back to its original position, and closes the incision with nylon suture. The surgeon may leave a small suction drain left in place to help remove any excess fluid. The drain will be removed in just a few days.

**Anesthesia Summary  
**Almost all the time, these are basic cases without the presence of an elevated ICP. So ICP precautions and management do not pertain. The only difficult part of the procedure is positioning. You just need to find out before hand and go from there.  
**Pre-op:  
Why is this procedure indicated?**  
This patient may be a status post head trauma on seizure medications with neuro deficits etc. If the patient is on seizure medication, you may want to know the anticonvulsant levels along with a CBC and Electrolytes.

Assess baseline neurological status.  
Verify position with the surgeon or circulating nurse. If the head is to be flexed (chin to chest), you may consider an armoured ETT since kinking may occur with a regular ETT in this position.  
Are Mayfield pins being utilized for positioning?  
If so, you already know to prepare an extra syringe of propofol to administer prior the application by the surgeon.  
Standard labs etc.  
**Most Stimulating Events During Craniotomy: (When to make your patient deeper)**  
Laryngoscopy and Tracheal intubation  
Tightening Mayfield Pins  
Incision to the skin and bone cutting (skull)

**Anesthesia:** General/ETT  
**Induction:** standard  
**Muscle relaxants:** Not really needed, but we usually do to avoid movement if the patient gets light.  
**Warning:** The duration of action of NDMR is reduced by many anticonvulsants. Atracurium and Cisatracurium are not affected by anticonvulsants because of Hoffman elimination. However, we still usually use Rocuronium and Vecuronium.  
**Inhalation Agent:** Should not matter if there are not ICP concerns  
**IV Fluid:** All texts books say NS, but most of us still use LR. Remember, there is about 100mLs of free water with a liter of LR. Avoid Dextrose containing IV as it exacerbates ischemia (increases neuronal lactate production) and edema with neuro deficits possible.  
**Hydration:** Normovolemic: volume restriction is no longer used to treat elevated ICP. So you don’t need to keep them dry. Do not over hydrate.  
**Temperature:** Normothermic.  
Hyperthermia increases brain damage.  
Hypothermia: a decrease of body temp by 2°–3°C) is a major neuro-protectant. Sometimes used with bypass.  
**Central Line and CVP:** Not needed  
**A-line:** Not needed  
**Neuro Monitoring:** No  
**Positioning:** As mentioned earlier, find out ahead of time. Frontal, temporal, and parieto-occipital craniotomies are supine.  
HOB up 15-30 degrees to facilitate venous drainage and drainage of CSF.  
Make sure the patient’s head is not flexed or rotated too far because it could decrease jugular venous drainage, and can increase ICP.  
Make sure your vent tubing is stretched out and aligned correctly before the OR staff rotates the bed 90-180 degrees. Many of us tape the vent tubing out of the way over the patient’s chest. Arms are usually to the side but not tightly tucked.

**Head stability:** Either on towels, a cerebellar head rest or placed in three fixation points (Mayfield Head Pins).  
**Mayfield Pins and Propofol:** The application of Mayfield Pins is very stimulating. Most of us bolus 50-100 mg of Propofol, prior to tightening the pins, to prevent the BP from skyrocketing. Always have some extra propofol available.

**Intra-Op Maintenance**  
Just don’t do anything the make the brain swell. Do not over hydrate and give steroids. If the brain swells during the anesthesia, the surgeon may not have room to apply the custom shaped graft or bone flap.  
Titrate your inhalation agents, drips and narcotics with the desired BP. Don’t use crystalloids to correct hypotension.  
**Ventilation:** Not usually an issue. Most anesthesia providers still mildly hyperventilate.  
Avoid Peep >10cm. It could decrease venous drainage and increase ICP.  
**EBL:** 50-200mLs  
**Steroids:** Yes, ask the surgeon or 8 mg decadron.  
**Dura irritation:** The surgeon should not be penetrating the dura, but it could still become irritated in the process of separating layers above it. This can be very stimulating to the patient.

**Possible Complications  
**Infection  
Hemorrhage (rare)  
Mayfield pin complications  

**More Notes  
**We all know that a craniotomy is performed to gain access to the brain for surgery by removing a portion of the skull. After the surgery, the bone that was removed from the skull is usually replaced using sutures or metal plates. A craniotomy is performed when a portion of the skull is removed and but not immediately replaced; usually done to remove a brain tumor.

Another example is when a surgeon performs a craniotomy to create room for the brain to swell after trauma (**decompressive craniectomy)** or to remove the bone due to an infection in the skull or a severely damaged skull with multiple fragments. A graft or flap can be applied later.

A helmet is worn by the patient to protect the soft spot. Even after repair, it usually takes at least 6 weeks for the bone to completely heal. Any activity that may risk a hit to the head or fall are completely prohibited as the skull bone takes long time to heal and any physic injury could be life-threatening. Wearing a protective helmet is recommended.

Bone flaps are usually replaced 1 - 3 months after the craniectomy.

**Decompressive craniectomy**  
A neurosurgical procedure, in which part of the skull is removed, to allow a swelling brain room to expand, which prevents brain damage. It is performed on victims of traumatic brain injury and stroke All cases of decompressive craniectomy eventually require second surgery for cranioplasty.

**Craniotomy and Craniectomy**  
Both procedures involve removing a portion of the skull, usually to perform surgery on the brain. The difference is that after a **craniotomy** the bone is replaced and after a **craniectomy** the bone is not replaced immediately.
