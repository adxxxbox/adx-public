# Narcan

**Narcan (Naloxone)**  
**Class:** Opiate Antagonist  
**Doses:**  
The books tell you: 100-400mcg/kg, titrate 0.1mg (100mcg) at a time.  
**Emergence- to initiate respirations:** 40mcg increments q2-3 minutes until the return of adequate respirations and ventilation.  
**PACU:** 40-80mcg doses, titrate to effect.  
  
**Peds:** < 20kg:0.1mg/kg IV q 2-3 mins  
\> 20kg:2mg dose q2-3 mins  
(40mcg doses is the most popular)  
**Drip:** 2.5-160 mcg/kg/hr (extremely rare)  
**OETT:** 1:1 dilution with NS  
The common vial of Narcan is 0.4mg in 1mL (or 400mcg).  
Aspirate the 1mL from the vial and add it to 9mLs of any crystalloid in a 10mL syringe yeilds 40mcg/mL.  
**Emergence:**  
Give just 1mL (40mcg) and wait a few minutes for spontaneous respirations.  
Patients usually wake up very smooth because just enough was administered to initiate spontaneous respirations with a partial narcotic reversal.  
The minimal effective dose enables the patient to properly respond to any needed narcotics in the PACU.  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes (renarcotizatin may occur). When Narcan was administered in the operating room, the PACU nurse should be informed of the time of administration. The patients are usually required to stay a few extra hours in PACU, per hospital policy.  
  
**Half life:** 64 minutes  
**Narcan side effects:**  
Nausea and vomiting  
Hypertension  
Arrhythmias  
Pulmonary edema  
Sudden pain may be an etiology for the side effects that we see.  
  
**More Notes**  
High affinity for opioid receptors.  
Displaces the opioid from mu receptors.  
Has no agonist activity.  
Can reverse analgesia.  
Counteracts sedation, lethargy (no effect on other causes of depression).  
Shifts the CO2 response curve to the left (morphine shifts it to the right).  
  
**Note:** GI doctors have commonly administered the entire vial of Narcan when reversing Demerol at the end of conscious sedation procedures.
