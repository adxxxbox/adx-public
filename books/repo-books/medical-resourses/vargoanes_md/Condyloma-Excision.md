### Condyloma Excision

**Condyloma** (Genital Warts) from Human papillomavirus (HPV).  
During surgical removal of these condylomas, if a bovie is used, the debris from the cauterization is microparticles are all highly contagious, so you will be given a filtered OR mask to wear for this procedure. If not, find one yourself.  
**Anesthetic:** General, usually LMA, sometimes ETT.  
Deep MAC is possible.  
**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
**Position:** Lithotomy  
**EBL:** Minimal  

**Possible Complications**  
Bleeding  
Infection  
Transmission to the OR staff  

**Condyloma Transmission and Cancer**  
There have been several reports of HPV transmission from patient to treating professionals from the surgical smoke created by the Electrocautery laser tissue, laser tissue ablation and/or ultrasound (harmonic) tissue dissection with HPV.

95% of surgical smoke is water, but the remaining 5% contains potentially hazardous particles, including blood fragments, airborne bacteria, viruses and lung-damaging dust.

Tighten your surgical mask. Also, wear eye goggles.

HPV is now widely recognized as responsible for more than 95% of the cervical cancers in women. The sexual transmission of the carcinogenic HPV types is also responsible for the development of most, if not all, squamous cell malignancies that occur in the lower ano-genital tract, in men and women alike.

These sexually transmitted HPV types are the cause of genital warts (condylomata acuminata).
