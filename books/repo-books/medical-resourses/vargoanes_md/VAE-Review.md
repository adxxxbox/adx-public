### Venous Air Embolism Review

In the sitting position, above the heart, there is a lower CVP due to the gravitational effect. So the intravenous pressure above the heart is negative, relative to the atmospheric pressure. A surgical excision above the heart with the body in the sitting position that experiences the excision of a non-collapsible vein means that room air can be entrained into that non-collapsible vein rather than bleeding out.  
There are some non-collapsible veins in the skull that are attached to the bone or dura.

When these skull veins entrain air, it will travel down to the Right Atrium. If the air somehow gets into the left heart, that’s when complications occur. Remember, 20-25% of the population have a residual Foramen Ovale that is functionally closed as long as LAP > RAP.

**Monitors for VAE:**  
Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE)  
Pre-Cordial Doppler  

**Early Symptoms of VAE:**  
Sudden drop in ETCO2.  
Increased end tidal nitrogen.  
Air seen with TEE.  
Increased PAP  

**Late Symptoms of VAE:**  
Elevated CVP readings.  
Hypotension  
Hypoxemia  
Ventricular ectopy  
A ‘Mill wheel’ precordial murmur.  

**VAE Treatment:**  
MAIN GOAL: Limit entrainment of additional air!  
Notify MD and stop the influx of air.  
If the patient has a central line, aspirate the air from their right atrium.  
You can apply Jugular venous pressure for 15 seconds to raise venous pressure in the wound so the vessel can back bleed and be identified.  
Flood the field with saline.  
Place the patient in left lateral position with head down slightly. Give 100% oxygen.  
D/C Nitrous Oxide because NO can enhance the VAE.  

**When Air is in the RIGHT side of the heart:**   
This often occurs, but it is usually silent and not noticed. We rarely see a massive VAE create an air lock in the RV and cause a right heart outflow obstruction. Usually there is a slow entrainment of air into the venous system, right heart and pulmonary vasculature.   
The mechanical obstruction of small pulmonary arteries and arterioles can causes a release of endogenous vasoactive agents increasing PVR, RV afterload, PAP and CVP. The RV may begin to fail. Then, hypotension and a reduced cardiac output may follow with ARDS.  
Asphyxia from obstruction to the pulmonary circulation from air embolism in the pulmonary artery can occur. VAE can produce death by mechanical over-distension of the RV.

**Residual Foramen Ovale:**   
20-25% of population has a residual Foramen Ovale that is functionally closed as long as LAP > RAP.  
However, while in the sitting position, the combination of air in the RA, ventilator settings of positive pressure and PEEP will increase pressures inside the Right Atrium. If these pressures are high enough, the increase may be enough to open the Residual Foramen Ovale.  If the entrained air travels to the left side of the heart, we are now looking at an arterial embolism. It can obstruct the coronary vessels and cerebral vasculature, and then possibly cause death.

**When air gets to the left side:**   
If enough air gets to the left side of the heart, it could obstruct the coronary and cerebral vasculature. We all know what happens next.  

**VAE Incidence Rates during certain procedures:**  
Craniosynostosis: 85%  
Total Hip: 67%  
Sitting post fossa craniotomy: 45-55%  
Post fossa craniotomy, horizontal:  
10-15%  
Transsphenoidal pituitary resection:  
12%
