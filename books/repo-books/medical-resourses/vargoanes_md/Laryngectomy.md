Laryngectomy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Laryngectomy

The removal of the larynx and separation of the airway from the mouth, nose and esophagus.

  
**Total Laryngectomy**: the entire larynx is removed.  
**Partial Laryngectomy:** only a portion is removed.

The patient ends up with a tracheostomy until the swelling goes down, then the tracheostomy tube is removed and the patient will breathe through a stoma. These procedures for the treatment of laryngeal cancer are becoming rarer. Now more conservative surgeries exist that are combined with radiation and/or chemotherapy.     

Most of the above procedures seemed to be combined with a radical neck.

**Anesthesia:** General/ETT  
In some Total Laryngectomies, the surgeon may perform a tracheostomy in the beginning. He/she will ask for the ETT and insert it through the stoma and suture it in place to keep it secure. Have a few smaller ETTs available. Sometimes the surgeon will ask you to advance the ETT more distally while he/she is in the trachea.

**Duration:** 3-7 hours. Length of case depends on if it is a combined procedure.

**IV Access:** 2 IVs, 20G or 18G.  
**A-line:** Yes.  
**Foley:** Yes, because it can be a long case.  
**Hydration:** Normovolemia.  
**BP:** The trachea is vascular and the surgeon may want you to keep the MAP 60-80mmHg.

**Airway Fire Risk:** Yes, when the surgeon is using a bovie within the trachea, be sure to keep the FIO2 low. Most surgeons will warn you while some will not. These cases you have to watch the surgeon a lot and anticipate. If you are in a good relationship with the surgical scrub and you can trust them, ask them to give you a look or a throat clearing if the surgeon is getting ready to use fire in the hole.

**Position:** Supine with arms tucked. Sometimes reverse Trendelenburg is used which lowers the BP.  Many times the bed is rotated 90-180 degrees.

**EBL**: 50-200 ccs.  
**Muscle Relaxant:** Usually. Ask if unsure.  
**Neosynephrine Drip:** Consider it. Remember that the arms will be tucked and the surgeon may request reverse Trendelenburg. Many of these patients are old smokers with comorbidities.

**Complications:**  
Pharyngocutaneous fistulas.  
Hemorrhage  
Airway fire.  
Wound Infection.  
Subcutaneous Emphysema.  
Excessive swelling or bleeding.  
   
**More Notes:**

**Hemi-Laryngectomy (Partial):** Removal of a unilateral true and false vocal cord. A tracheostomy tube is required until the swelling goes down. The intended goals are to maintain laryngeal speech, and preserve swallowing functions.  
 

**Supraglottic Laryngectomy:** Incomplete resection of the larynx in which the supraglottic portion is removed, thus preserving the vocal cords.

The **_laryngectomee_** breathes through a stoma. This procedure is usually performed in cases of laryngeal cancer. However, many laryngeal cancer cases are now treated only with more conservative surgeries through the mouth, with radiation and/or chemotherapy. A laryngectomy is performed when those treatments fail to conserve the larynx or there is sufficient destruction by the cancer that would prevent normal function once it is destroyed. A laryngectomy is also performed on individuals with other types of head and neck cancer or severe swallowing problems.
