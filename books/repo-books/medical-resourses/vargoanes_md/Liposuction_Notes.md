### Liposuction Notes

Liposuction is defined as removal of excess fat deposits from beneath the skin using a cannula with the assistance of a powerful vacuum.  
  
**Possible areas for liposuction  
**Thighs  
Hips and buttocks  
Abdomen and waist  
Upper arms  
Back  
Inner knee  
Chest area  
Cheeks, chin and neck  
Calves and ankles  
  
**Two types of liposuction according to the volume of solution aspirated**  
  
**High volume:** \>4,000 ml aspirated: Must use general anesthesia.  
**Low volume:** <4,000 ml aspirated: may be done under monitored anesthesia care with sedation.  
  
**High volume:** Involves the injection of a large volume of wetting solution into the subcutaneous tissue. Blood loss is difficult to assess. Has potential for large fluid shifts secondary to the volume of tissue removed, with a risk of developing pulmonary edema.  
Careful IV fluid management is important, and hypothermia risk is increased. Hypothermia may contribute to cardiac dysrhythmias, coagulopathies, oliguria, and electrolyte imbalance.**  
  
Hypothermia is a risk with high volume due to:**  
Open exposure of large body surface areas.  
Infusion of large volumes of cold wetting solutions.  
Long duration of procedure.  
General anesthesia.  
Heat loss during mechanical ventilation  
Ambient room temperature.  
Non-warmed intravenous fluids.  
  
**Methods to prevent hypothermia  
**Utilize warm IV fluids.  
Use a forced air warming blanket (Bair Hugger).  
Maintain operating room temp.  
Warm betadine preparation solution.  
Cover exposed body when possible.  
  
**Cardiovascular effects of high volume liposuction  
**Increase in cardiac index (due to epinephrine).  
Increase heart rate (due to epinephrine).  
Increase mean pulmonary arterial pressure.  
Increase in stroke volume index.  
Increase in right ventricular stroke work index.  
Decrease in mean arterial pressure (due to anesthesia).  
Decrease in systemic vascular resistance (due to anesthesia).  
**Four main types of liposuction techniques based on the volume of infiltration or wetting solution injected:  
1\. Dry Technique:** There is no infiltration of fluid. The aspiration cannula is inserted directly into the space from which the fat will be removed.  
EBL is 20-45% of the aspirated volume.  
  
**2\. Wet Technique:** 200-300 ml of volume is injected per area of treatment regardless of how much is aspirated.  
EBL is 4-30% of aspirated volume.  
**3\. Superwet Technique:** 1 mL is equally injected per 1 mL of aspirated fat removed.  
Blood loss is approximately 4-30% of the aspirated volume.  
  
**4\. Tumescent liposuction:** Most common and more advanced.  
Large volumes of up to 35-55mg/kg of dilute lidocaine (wetting solution) are injected into the fat to provide anesthesia and decrease blood loss.  
The blood level of lidocaine varies according to the vascularity of the area where liposuction is being performed. The blood level of lidocaine is increased in more vascular areas such as the breast and abdomen. It is decreased in less vascular areas such as the thighs.  
Lidocaine toxicity is rare despite the high doses used, but it possible.  
  
Sodium bicarbonate is often added to decrease the burning sensation associated with injection of the tumescent solution.  
Steroids may also be added to this solution for anti-inflammatory purposes.  
  
**Peak lidocaine levels  
**Peak levels of lignocaine and its active metabolite monoethylglycinexylidide occur in 8-32 hours after initial infiltration, but are well below the blood toxic concentration of 6 mg/L.  
The mixed epinephrine and low volume of blood flow to subcutaneous fat slows the rate of lidocaine absorption.  
  
**Two popular wetting solutions  
Klein’s solution:** Normal saline, lidocaine, epinephrine and sodium bicarbonate.  
**Hunstadt’s solution:** Lactated ringers, lidocaine and epinephrine.
