Spinal Veins    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Spinal Veins

Venous drainage of the spinal cord follows a similar distribution as the spinal arteries.  
  
**Anterior and Posterior Veins**There are 3 longitudinal anterior spinal veins and 3 posterior spinal veins that communicate with the segmental anterior and posterior radicular veins.  
  
_Drainage of the medial and lateral components of the epidural space is via the internal vertebral venous plexus.  
  
_  
Some literature states that there is just one posterior spinal vein, rather than two smaller posterolateral veins, and this is frequently of smaller caliber than the anterior median vein.
