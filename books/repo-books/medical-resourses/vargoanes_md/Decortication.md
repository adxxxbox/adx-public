### Decortication (Pleural Stripping) – Thoracoscopy

Empyema is an infection in the pleural space.  
When an empyema develops, the infected fluid within the pleural will settle and adhere onto the surface of the lung and the chest wall.  

**Pleural peel**: The infected deposits that settle and adhere onto the surface of the lung. The lung becomes compressed "trapped" and unable to fully inflate.

**Treatment:** Receive a minimally invasive thoracoscopy (VATS) to drain the fluid and remove the pleural peel from the surface of the lung and chest wall.

If the process above is not treated in time, the amount and density of the pleural peel exceeds the ability of thoracoscopy to remove it, then a thoracotomy is required.  
Just because the surgeon is entering the thorax, we prepare for the worst, incase of a large unexpected hemorrhage.  
This procedure is usually a basic VATS.  

**Type and Crossed:** Yes, with 2 units of pack cells available prior to surgery.  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT (Left DLT).  
**Duration:** 1.5-3 hours.  
**EBL:** 100-500mls  
**DLT:** Males are usually 39F and Females 37F.  
**Bronchoscope:** Needs to be ready in the room before induction. A bronchoscopy is performed by the anesthesiologist or surgeon to verify Left DLT placement. Make sure you really secure the DLT with tape because if it moves out of place, the operative lung will not drop when needed.  
**Large Hemostat- (Kelly Clamp):** Have one available for clamping the DLT to drop (deflate) the appropriate lung.  
**Thoracic Epidural**: Usually. Make sure you bolus the epidural before incision. It really helps limit intra-op and post-op pain.  
**IV Access:** 2 large bore, usually 18G.  
**A-line:** Yes  
**Central Line:** Not as popular as before.   
**Labs:** We usually draw from the A-line-1 ABG and CBC. It usually depends on duration and EBL. An ABG is usually drawn about 15 minutes after one lung ventilation is initiated.  
**Foley Catheter:** Usually, especially if the patient has an epidural.  
**Neosynephrine Drip:** Yes  
**Position**: Lateral decubitus with the affected (independent) lung up. An axillary roll is needed and the bed will be flexed. Extra pillows or folded blankets are needed between the abducted arms and elevating the head to the neutral position. There are usually 4 people simultaneously positioning the patient in the presence of the surgeon. Make sure nothing is pushing against the DLT and you have easy access for clamping. Untangle IV lines and have easy access to you’re A-line for ABGs.  
**Fluid warmer and warming blanket:** Yes, sometimes 2 warming blankets. These patients (especially if it is an open chest) are very prone to hypothermia.  
**Ventilation:** When the lung is down, you need to immediately change your ventilator setting so you don’t over inflate and damage the remaining inflated lung. Some CRNAs switch to Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV) and limit the peak pressures (PIP) to 30cmH20 and titrate with your ETCO2. Some just decrease the tidal volume in half. Try to keep PIP’s below 40cmH2O. You will need to increase your ventilator rate to compensate. Adding 3-5cmH20 of PEEP is common.  
Increase O2 to 100%  
If the dependent lung is healthy (with proper DLT placement), you may get lucky and have no decreasing SaO2 issues.  
**Decreasing SaO2:** Desaturations are common with one lung ventilation. First attempt to manually ventilate the dependent lung by applying more PIP with some inspiratory holds (pulmonary recruitment). If that does not work, inform the surgeon and he will permit you to reinflate and ventilate the independent lung. Once the SaO2 returns to the desired baseline, you will drop the independent lung again. This process may be repeated.  
**Reinflate the lung:** When the case is complete, the surgeon will ask you to reinflate the lung. Manually ventilate the patient up to 30cmH20 until you see the lung reinflated.

Place the patient back on your original ventilation settings because you are now ventilating both lungs.  
**Chest Tube(s):** At the end of the case with closing, a chest tube(s) will be inserted and the surgeon may want to know how much volume you are losing. If your tidal volume is set on 700mLs and you are only getting back 400mLs, you are obviously losing 300mls. 

This should improve when the chest tube(s) is connected to suction.

**Emergence:** AWAKE extubation with the head of the bed up (high fowlers). Many times we roll the patient on their stretcher and extubate them. The stretcher seems easier to extubate in high fowlers position.  
  

**Complications:**  
Hemorrhage Vocal Cord Damage from the DLT insertion  
Infection  
Trauma to surrounding organs  
Pneumothorax  
  
**Advantages**  
Shorter hospital stays  
Decreased post-op pain and reduced usage of narcotics  
Smaller post-operative scars  
Earlier return to work compared to traditional “open” procedures
