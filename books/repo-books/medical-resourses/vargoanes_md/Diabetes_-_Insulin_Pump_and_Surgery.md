### Diabetes - Insulin Pump and Surgery

The insulin pump is a small battery-operated external device that contains a refillable insulin reservoir.  
The device is about the size of a deck of cards that can be worn on a belt, kept in a pocket, or worn on the patient’s skin. It delivers insulin through a small needle (also known as cannula) that is inserted subcutaneously.  
Although pumps can be worn in a variety of locations, the abdomen is the most prevalent site among patients.  
  
It is estimated that there are more than 400,000 pump users in the United States.  
The majority of patients with an insulin pump have Type 1 diabetes, but use is growing in Type 2 diabetics.  
  
**There are two general principles for insulin dosing.**  
**1\.** **Basal rate:** The pump delivers small amounts of insulin in a continuous fashion. This continuous background insulin infusion is measured in units/hour.  
Rates are variable, and differ between individuals and across a 24-hour period within the same individual.  
Some individuals have different basal profiles for different times or activities (e.g. work vs. non-work days, exercise, illness, etc.).  
  
**2\.** **Bolus Insulin:** The amount of insulin given for a meal or snack.  
The patient determines the dose based on the estimated amount of carbohydrates to be consumed for a meal/snack, and is calculated from their individual Insulin t o Carbohydrate ratio (ICR). Example: ICR 1:10 = 1 unit of insulin/10g of carbohydrate.  
  
**Type of insulin used by pumps**  
Insulin used in pumps is generally a rapid acting analog of short duration (NovaLog, Humalog, Apridra).  
Onset of action: 5-15 min; peak: 60 min; duration: 4-5 hours and include: Lispro (Humalog), Aspart (Novolog) and, Glulisine (Apidra).  
Rarely do pumps have 70:30 (short and intermediate acting) insulin.  
  
**Insulin pumps and NPO  
**Hypoglycemia is rare when the patient maintains their usual basal rates while NPO overnight.  
However, the patient is usually advised to reduce their basal rate by 10-20% to avoid the possibility of incidental hypoglycemia.  
  
**Patients with insulin pumps are knowledgeable.**  
Any patient who has a pump has already proven to be an educated, reliable, and responsible manager of their disease process.  
You should always consider a patient’s opinion when formulating their perioperative management.  
Discuss the patient’s preoperative blood sugar with them.  
  
**The patient should have already been instructed to do the following:**  
Patient should change insertion site and reservoir the day before surgery, and bring extra supplies (insertion set, reservoir, extra batteries).  
For surgery involving the abdominal area, the patient may place the pump catheter in a site other than abdomen (such as arm, hip or thigh).**  
  
Preoperative evaluation for patients with an insulin pump.**  
Find out what type of insulin is infused, basal rate, the insulin to carbohydrate ratio, and the insulin sensitivity factor.  
Did the patient decrease their basal rate while NPO?  
Examine insulin pump insertion site for signs of inflammation or leakage.  
Date and time of cannula insertion should be documented. (Most patients will remove and replace the cannula every 3 days).  
  
Did the patient change the infusion set and site, and use fresh insulin in the reservoir on the day of surgery?  
Then the pump can run for two to three days without needing to be changed.  
The patient should have been advised to bring additional insulin and pump supplies to the hospital.**  
  
To continue or disconnect the insulin pump for surgery**Most patients continue their insulin pumps during surgery, unless the infusion site is in a location close to where the surgery will occur.  
  
The insulin pump may be disconnected for very extensive procedures, and the IV insulin infusion can be substituted for the pump as needed with Q 1 hours blood glucose monitoring per anesthesia.  
  
The patient should turn the pump off when the BG <110 mg/dl (6.1 mM).  
  
Correctional insulin bolus therapy is provided to treat blood glucose >180 mg/dl (10 mM).  
  
**Do anesthesia providers change settings on the insulin pump during surgery?  
**Some literature suggests that the anesthesia provider have access to the pump during surgery, and to turn it off when the BG <110 mg/dL, etc.  
Normally, the anesthesia provider does not manually alter the patient’s insulin pump settings perioperatively.**  
  
Insulin pumps settings for surgery**  
The anesthesia provider will usually ask the patient to decrease their basal rate by 50%, and we will monitor and treat their glucose perioperatively per institution’s protocol (sliding scale).  
  
**“Sick Day” or “Sleep Basal Rate”** is a type of decreased “Temporary Basal Rate” feature used when patients are sick.  
Patients may use this mode rather than a 50% decrease in basal rate for surgery.  
The glucose level should be checked every hour during surgery, and corrective doses of insulin given as per hospital protocol.  
  
Perioperative management of the diabetes is via IV administration of regular insulin to maintain BG levels in the 130-180 range.  
  
In PACU, the patient resumes the pump when he/she feels it is appropriate to do so.  
**Patients can self-treat preoperatively.  
If the patient is normoglycemic (within their own target range)  
**No change. Patient decreases basal rate by 50% prior to going into surgery.  
**If the patient is hyperglycemic  
**The patient can simply self-medicate preoperatively, and anesthesia will monitor and treat the patient thereafter.  
If glucose level >300 mg/dL, intravenous insulin infusion should be considered.  
  
**High glucose concentrations while the insulin pump is on, and presumably infusing insulin subcutaneously may indicate:**  
A malfunction in the pump  
Disconnection or blockage of the infusion tube  
Problems with the cannula  
Poor subcutaneous absorption  
  
**Intraoperative radiography**  
Pump manufacturers recommend that the pump be placed out of range of radiation  
(x-ray, CT scans, and MRIs).  
The device can be disconnected and removed from the operating room according to the pump manufacturer’s recommendations.  
If unsure, the patient can call the 1-800 number on the back of the pump for answers.  
**  
Electrocautery  
**Electrocautery may or may not increase the risk of pump damage.  
The patient may have guidelines which include provisions to determine the manufacturer's recommendations for use of the specific pump during surgery.
