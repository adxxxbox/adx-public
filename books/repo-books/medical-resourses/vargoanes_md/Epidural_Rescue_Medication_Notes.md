### Epidural Rescue Medication Notes

When a patient has an epidural, she may start to feel pain as labor progresses despite being on a PCEA. This often necessitates an extra dose and possibly an increase in the PCEA basal rate. The extra bolus we administer is called either a “Top Off, Re-dose” or “Rescue Medication.”  
  
The specific medications administered for one of the above are referred to as “Rescue Medications.”  
There are many variations of **rescue medications** .  
The rescue medication may be a local anesthetic, an opioid, or both.  
  
Rescue Medications vary among anesthesia providers.  
  
**Notes on Rescue Medications**  
  
**Avoid higher concentrations of local anesthetics**  
Higher concentrations of Bupivacaine in an infusion are rarely required, and they should be avoided unless analgesia is unsatisfactory. If you do increase the concentration is increased, degree of motor block is increased, and that will increase the chances of a forceps delivery or, even worse, a C-section. The parturient must maintain motors function in order to push. A low concentration of 0.125% or 0.25% of Bupivacaine are commonly-used safe concentrations.  
  
**Ropivacaine  
**Ropivacaine may cause less motor block, and is less toxic, than bupivacaine, but is less potent.  
Appropriate ropivacaine concentrations for rescue or top off bolus is 0.2%.  
0.1% or 0.2% are commonly used for continuous infusion with or without narcotics. Ropivacaine is becoming more popular than bupivacaine as an OB local anesthetic because of its greater safety profile and decreased motor block.  
  
**Inadequate Analgesia  
**Rescue medications/inadequate analgesia: Assess patient, catheter, and block height. Different anesthesia providers use different rescue medications.  
  
If the catheter is appropriately placed, there is inadequate block height or increased pain from progression of labor. Place the patient in the appropriate position and administer one of the following:  
  
A) 3.5 cc of 0.25% bupivacaine with 3.5 cc sterile saline and 1 ml (50 mcg) fentanyl  
or  
B) 8 ml of 0.2% ropivacaine with 2 ml (100 mcg) fentanyl
