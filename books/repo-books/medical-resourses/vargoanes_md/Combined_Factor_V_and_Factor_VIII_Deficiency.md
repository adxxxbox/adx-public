Combined Factor V and Factor VIII Deficiency    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Combined Factor V and Factor VIII Deficiency

Combined factor V and factor VIII deficiency is very rare.  
**Incidence:** Fewer than 100 people in 60 families have been identified in the world to date.  
Most of the cases have been found around the Mediterranean Sea, especially in Israel, Iran and Italy.  
Because the amount of these factors in the body is lower than normal, the clotting reaction is blocked prematurely and the blood clot does not form. The combined deficiency is completely separate from factor V deficiency and factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia A).  
  
While still rare, this makes the factor V and factor VIII deficiency the most common combined factor deficiency.  
  
It is an “autosomal recessive” disorder. This means that both parents must carry the defective gene to be able to pass it on to their children.  
  
In extremely rare cases, a deficiency in factors V and VIII could have a different cause. Instead of a single defective factor V-VIII gene on chromosome 18, a child could inherit a defective factor V gene from both parents and a defective factor VIII gene from one parent.  
  
The chances of inheriting factor V deficiency are 1 in 1,000,000 and the chances of inheriting factor VIII are 1 in 10,000. Therefore, the chances of inheriting both defective genes separately are 1 in 10 billion.  
  
The combination of factor V and factor VIII deficiency does not seem to cause more bleeding than if only one or the other of the factors were affected. The symptoms of combined factor V and factor VIII deficiency are generally mild.  
  
**Common symptoms are:**  
Nose bleeds.  
Easy bruising.  
Menorrhagia.  
Bleeding after trauma (an injury).  
Bleeding after surgery.  
  
**Three treatments are available to control bleeding:  
**Fresh frozen plasma (which contains factors V and VIII).  
Factor VIII concentrate (which contains only factor VIII).  
Desmopressin.
