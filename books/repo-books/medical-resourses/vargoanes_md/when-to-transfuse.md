# When to Transfuse

American Society of Anesthesiologists Guidelines  
Recommended for Hb <6g/dL  
Rarely needed for Hb >10g/dL  
For Hb 6-10g/dL, evaluate clinical evidence.  
**Warning:** All transfusions cause some degree of harm in EVERY patient due to the physical properties of stored blood and because of impairments in immune system function.  
Anesthesia providers have become much more resistant to transfusing blood unless it is absolutely necessary.  
Lab values are no longer the #1 indicator for transfusing blood, unless they are extreme. The decision must be the specific patients needs.  
Supporting Indications of Blood Transfusions  
Uncontrolled or Active Hemorrhage  
Tissue ischemia-i.e., shock (cardiac, muscle, visceral, etc)  
**NOT Indicators**  
Anemia  
Arbitrary Hemoglobin measurement  
Decreased CO or BP  
**Biggest Indicator**  
Intraoperative, unstable  
Active, uncontrolled hemorrhage  
Tissue Ischemia-verified via lactate levels, pH, base deficit and increasing Creatinine.
