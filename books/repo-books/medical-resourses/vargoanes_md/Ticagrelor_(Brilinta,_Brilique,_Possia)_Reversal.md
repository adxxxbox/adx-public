Ticagrelor (Brilinta, Brilique, Possia) Reversal    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Ticagrelor (Brilinta, Brilique, Possia) Reversal

_Currently, there is a lack of specific antidotes for the growing number of new (novel) anticoagulants that are slowly replacing warfarin and heparin. For this reason, there is NO universal standard of care for the treatment of the anticoagulated bleeding patient when there is no specific antidote._

**Consult cardiology for ALL patients with coronary stents.**  
  
**Quick Notes  
**A platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor.Ticagrelor _is a reversible antiplatelet drug that DOES NOT inhibits platelet function for the lifetime of the platelets._  
Ticagrelor is known to act faster than clopidogrel.  
  
**Half-life:** is 7 hours for parent drug and 9 hours for the active metabolite.  
  
**Specific Antidote:** none.  
  
New drug **MED12452** is being developed as an antidote.  
**  
Reversal methods are similar to other P2Y12 receptor inhibitors:**  
Ticlopidine  
Prasugrel  
Clopidogrel  
  
**Dialysis:** Not effective.  
**  
Non-Urgent**  
Discontinue 5-10 days prior to surgery.  
Cardiology consult.  
**  
Urgent (Not bleeding) - options vary among institutional protocols**  
Discontinue and find out when the last dose was.  
Cardiology or hematology consult.**Evaluate platelet function:** Platelet function assay.  
Tranexamic Acid - 1 gram  
Desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg x 1 ( _Warning: DDAVP can lead to arterial vasospasm_ ).  
Consider platelet transfusion (1 unit) if > 40% inhibited prior to high risk bleeding procedures.  
  
**Minor bleeding: options vary among institutional protocols.  
**Cardiology or hematology consult.  
  
**Evaluate platelet function:** Platelet function assay.Tranexamic Acid - 1 gram.  
Desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg x 1 ( _Warning: DDAVP can lead to arterial vasospasm_ ).  
1 unit of platelets if > 40% inhibited as per platelet function assay (PFA).  
  
Recheck PFA 1 hour after platelet transfusion complete.  
  
**Prior to high risk bleeding procedures:**  
Consider platelet transfusion (1 unit) if > 40% platelet inhibited prior to high risk bleeding procedures.  
Recheck PFA 1 hour after platelet transfusion complete.  
  
**Severe Bleed: options vary among institutional protocols.  
**Cardiology or hematology consult.  
Tranexamic Acid- 1 gram.  
  
**Evaluate platelet function:** Platelet function assay.  
Desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg x 1 ( _Warning: DDAVP can lead to arterial vasospasm_ ).  
Administer 1 unit of pheresis palatelets (1 unit = 6-10 pack) x 1 stat.  
Re-check PFA 1 hour after platelet transfusion complete.  
  
**Life-threatening  
**Transfuse more platelets.  
Initiate massive transfusion protocols.  
FEIBA 8 to 25 units/kg or Kcentra can be considered.
