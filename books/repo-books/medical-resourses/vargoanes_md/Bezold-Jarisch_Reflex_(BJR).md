### Bezold-Jarisch Reflex (BJR)

An inhibitory reflex that plays a role in cardiovascular homeostasis.  
Activation increases parasympathetic nervous system activity and inhibits sympathetic activity.   
The BJR cardioinhibitory receptors work in conjunction with the aortic and carotid baroreceptors, thus participate in blood pressure regulation.  
  
The left ventricle, particularly the inferoposterior wall, is a principal location for these sensory receptors.  
Stimulation of these inhibitory cardiac receptors by stretch, chemical substances or drugs increases parasympathetic activity and inhibits sympathetic activity.  
  
**Clinical importance of the Bezold-Jarisch Reflex**  
This reflex is believed to be responsible for bradyarrhythmia’s and hypotension in patients with inferior or posterior wall myocardial ischemia and infarction.  
Anterior wall ischemia often results in tachyarrhythmias and hypotension.  
It is also implicated in thrombolysis, revascularization, and syncope.  
Some anesthesia providers believe it is responsible in the cardiovascular collapse reported during regional anesthesia techniques.  
  
**Activation of ventricular mechanosensitive and chemosensitive receptors causes an inhibition of sympathetic outflow resulting in a triad of:**  
Hypotension  
Bradycardia  
Peripheral vasodilatation  
  
**Discovery:**  
In 1867, von Bezold and Hirt observed that an intravenous injection of veratrum alkaloids caused a profound decrease in blood pressure and heart rate in conjunction with apnea.  
The definition has been modified when the apnea was found to be from a different mechanism.  
Dawes in the mid twentieth century described BJR as a reflex resulting in bradycardia, vasodilation, and hypotension resulting from stimulation of cardiac receptors.  
  
**Documented Triggers of the Bezold-Jarisch Reflex are either chemical or mechanical.**  
Intracoronary injection of veratrum alkaloids, serotonin, nicotine, capsaicin, or phenyldiguamide.  
Coronary ischemia (MI)  
Bradykinin  
PGI2  
Arachidonic acid  
Ventricular distension  
Coronary angioplasty  
Thrombolysis  
Revascularization  
Syncope  
  
**We are only talking about** **mechanical triggers in this topic  
**The function of the mechanoreceptors is to signal changes in the inotropic and volume state (hypovolemia). Mechanical receptors in the left ventricle can be activated by a left ventricular stretch as a result of heightened contractile state during hypovolemia or ventricular systolic bulging during inferoposterior myocardial ischemia.  
Activation results in profound inhibition of the cardiac sympathetics.  
The purpose of the mechanoreceptors is to signal changes in the inotropic and volume state.table.tableizer-table { font-size: 12px; border: 1px solid #CCC; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; } .tableizer-table td { padding: 4px; margin: 3px; border: 1px solid #CCC; } .tableizer-table th { background-color: #104E8B; color: #FFF; font-weight: bold; }
