Fondaparinux (Arixtra)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Fondaparinux (Arixtra)

**Indirect Xa Inhibitor**  
Approved by the FDA in December 2001 with a black box warning similar to that of the LMWHs and heparinoids.  
  
Fondaparinux is often compared to unfractionated heparin (UFH) and Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) because of its structure. But it is neither.  
  
**Fondaparinux mechanisms of action comparisons with UFH, LMWH and Warfarin.**  
**Heparin:** Inhibits factors Xa and to a lesser extent IIa. It also inhibits XIIa, XIa and IXa.  
**Wafarin:** Inhibits the synthesis of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and anticoagulant proteins C and S. **Lovenox:** (LMWH) inhibits factors Xa and to a lesser extent IIa.  
**Fondaparinux:** An exclusive indirect factor Xa inhibitor.  
  
**_The fewer the clotting factors affected, the more reliable the anticoagulant, thus it does NOT need routine monitoring. Thus heparin and warfarin should be routinely monitored._**  
  
**Indications  
**Prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  
Treatment of Acute DVTs.  
At least as safe and effective as treatment of DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE) as LMWH and UFH, respectively.  
  
**Mechanism of action:** (Indirectly blocks (w/o binding to) Factor Xa) Selectively and IRREVERSIBLY binds to Antithrombin III.This potentiates the action of ATIII by 300-fold to inactivate ONLY Factor Xa.  
Prothrombin cannot be converted to thrombin.Has no direct effect on thrombin.Has no effect on platelet function.Has excellent bioavailability and longer half-life after Sub Q injection.  
  
**_Note:_** _HEPARIN potentiates the action of ATIII by 2,000-fold, but affects other clotting factors besides Factor Xa)._  
  
When Factor Xa is neutralized, it inhibits thrombin formation and thrombus development.  
Fondaparinux does NOT inactivate thrombin (activated Factor II) and has no known effect on platelet function.  
  
**_As a result, fondaparinux has a more predictable and reproducible anticoagulant effect and can be administered in a fixed dose once daily and does not require monitoring for anticoagulant effect._**

**![](fondaparinux.png)**

**_Blocks the activity of this clotting factor Xa indirectly by binding to and activating antithrombin III._  
  
****Fondaparinux and Chemical Structure vs UFH and LMWH  
**Fondaparinux is composed of five monomeric sugars that are identical to the sequence present in heparin that comprises the high affinity binding site for antithrombin III. **Unlike standard and low molecular weight heparins, however, fondaparinux is specific for Factor Xa and has no effect on thrombin or other clotting factors. As a result, fondaparinux has a more predictable and reproducible anticoagulant effect and can be administered in a fixed dose once daily and does not require monitoring for anticoagulant effect.  
  
In short:** **Fondaparinux** shares the same pentasaccharide sequence as UFH and LMWH for the binding to antithrombin, however it has no extra chain and thus, **is NOT considered a heparin product.  
  
Lab Monitoring:** Fondaparinux and other Factor Xa inhibitors are considered reliable and do not need routine monitoring, unlike Warfarin and Heparin.  
There are specific lab tests for each Factor Xa inhibitor.**  
  
Anti-Xa assay for Arixta  
**Laboratory monitoring of Fondaparinux is possible by utilizing factor Xa inhibitory activity of the drug. Anti-Xa assay (used for monitoring heparin) is modified by using a standard curve constructed with Fondaparinux.  
  
**Anti-Xa values:** In patients treated with 2.5 mg fondaparinux daily, the peak steady-state plasma concentration is (on average) 0.39 to 0.50 mcg/mL approximately 3 hours post-dose and the minimum steady-state plasma concentration is 0.14 to 0.19 mcg/mL.  
  
**Optional Lab Monitoring**  
Anti-Xa assay: **is most reliable, increases with increasing drug concentration)-reaches maximum values in 3 hours.** **Fondaparinux Anti-Xa assay–(FNDXT).**  
_Proper monitoring is done by measuring the peak anti-Xa level within 3-5 hours after subcutaneous injection._  
  
**Normal Anti - Xa assay:** indicates no anticoagulation effect.  
**Elevated PT:** Fondaparinux is present, but no linear correlation.  
**Normal PT:** Minimal drug effect  
**Elevated aPTT and INR:** Fondaparinux is present, but no linear correlation.  
**Fibrinolytic activity or bleeding time:** Not affected at recommended doses.  
  
**Fondaparinux and HIT:** To date, there have been very few reports of HIT with fondaparinux. Some have proposed fondaparinux as a treatment for HIT.  
Antibodies to PF4/heparin develop in postoperative orthopedic patients receiving fondaparinux at a rate similar to those receiving enoxaparin, but none reacted with PF4/fondaparinux. Fondaparinux is likely unable to react with PF4 and cause platelet activation.  
  
**Fondaparinux used as a treatment for HIT  
**Currently under study. Not an FDA approved indication.**  
  
Should it be used in a patient with HIT?  
**A reasonable option - more studies required.  
  
**Bleeding with factor Xa inhibitors** Annually, 1% to 4% of patients treated with factor Xa inhibitors experience major bleeding, and an additional 1% may require emergency surgery. In the U.S in 2015, more than 80,000 patients treated with oral factor Xa inhibitors were admitted to hospitals because of bleeding.  
  
**Dosing  
Prophylaxis:** 2.5 mg once a day**Treatment doses:  
< 50kg:** 5mg once daily**50 -100kg:** 7.5 mg daily**\> 100kg:** 10 mg daily**Renal Adjustments:  
CrCl 30-50 mL/min:** Use caution  
**CrCl < 30 mL/min:** Contraindicated  
  
**Peak plasma:** 2 hours after Sub Q injection  
**Elimination half-life:** about 17 hours. Dose dependent - convenient for daily dosing.  
**Elimination:** Exclusively by kidneys  
  
In patients treated with 5 mg (body weight <50 kg), 7.5 mg (body weight 50 to 100 kg), and 10 mg (body weight <50 kg), fondaparinux once daily, the mean peak steady state plasma concentration is approximately 1.20 to 1.26 mcg/mL and the mean minimum steady state plasma concentration is approximately 0.46 to 0.62 mcg/mL.

| **Half-life** | 0.5-2 hours | ~ 4-7 hours Daily to BID dosing | 15-17 hours Daily Sub Q dosing |
| **Dosing for renal impairment** | None needed | Must adjust If dialysis pt: not recommended | If CrCl < 30: contrandicated |
| **Lab Monitoring** | aPPT, ACT anti-factor 10x, check platelets | Routinely not done Optional: Anti-factor 10 Xa assay and check platelets | Routinely not done Optional: Anti-factor 10 Xa assay |

**Elimination:** In individuals with normal kidney function, fondaparinux is eliminated in urine mainly as unchanged drug.  
**Plasma T1/2:** 15-17 hours assuming single-daily dosing and normal renal function.  
**Renal:** Prolonged in patients with renal impairment.  
Fondaparinux can accumulate with renal dysfunction, and despite normal renal function, stable plateau requires 2–3 days to be achieved.  
  
Manufacturer recommends reducing dose with moderate renal insufficiency.  
Fondaparinux is contraindicated in severe renal insufficiency.  
  
**Total clearance of Fondaparinux:**  
25% lower in patients with mild renal impairment (CrCl 50 to 80 mL/min).  
40% lower in patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min).  
55% lower in patients with severe renal impairment ( < 30 mL/min).  
  
**Advantage of Fondaparinux over LMWH or unfractionated heparin**  
The risk for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is substantially lower.  
Unlike direct factor Xa inhibitors, it mediates its effects indirectly through antithrombin III, but unlike heparin, it is selective for factor Xa.  
  
**Recent ASRA and ESRA consensus**  
Recommends a 3-4-day interval (ideally 5 times. _T_ 1/2 ) before performing a regional anesthesia procedure; then resuming medication 12–24 hours post procedure.
