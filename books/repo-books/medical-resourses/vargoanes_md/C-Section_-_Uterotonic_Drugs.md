### Pitocin®, Hemabate®, Methergine® and Cytotec® Doses

**Below are the common uterotonic drugs administered during c-section and other OB/GYN procedures  
Oxytocin (Pitocin®),** 20 units per liter of IV fluid, repeated once, is the usual dose.  
More may be used at the surgeon’s option as required.  
  
**Methergine® (methylergonovine maleate),** 0.2 mg IM  
**Hemabate® (carboprost),** 250 mcg (0.25mg) IM  
**Cytotec® (misoprostol),** 800-1,000 mcg. Usually administered by surgeon directly into a the myometrium to correct uterine atony.  
**Quick Notes:  
  
Oxytocin (Pitocin®):** A synthetic version of the natural nonapeptide produced in the posterior pituitary. It comes in vials of 10 U/ml.  
For postpartum use, including third stage of labor, oxytocin is dosed at 10-40 U per liter of IV fluid and given as an IV infusion.  
**The plasma half- life:** 1-6 minutes**Onset** after IV infusion is rapid.  
**IM Pitocin:** Alternatively, Pitocin® may be administered IM (10 units).  
**IM Onset:** 3-5 minutes  
**Duration:** 3-5 hours  
  
**Possible side effects of Pitocin** include headache, tachycardia, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting.  
These are rare in the absence of prolonged use.  
Rapid IV infusion may result in hypotension and tachycardia.  
  
**Methergine® (methylergonovine maleate):**  
Methergine is a semi-synthetic adjuvant for the routine management of the third stage of labor and postpartum atony.  
Ampules contain 0.2 mg of active drug in a volume of 1 mL.  
The drug is given either as an intramuscular injection (1 ampule or orally (single tablet).  
IM is the most frequently-used route.  
It can have an exaggerated blood pressure response in the presence of ephedrine.  
Care should be taken when CYP 3A3 inhibiting agents, such as macrolide antibiotics, protease inhibitors, or azole antifungals have recently been used.  
**IM onset:** 2-5 minutes  
**Plasma half-life:** About 3.4 hours.  
Must NOT be administered IV.  
  
**Possible Side Effect of Methergine:** Rare in the absence of prolonged use.  
Most common are nausea and vomiting.  
Chest pain, arterial spasm, myocardial infarction, and hallucination have been reported in cases of toxicity.  
**  
Hemabate® (carboprost or 15 methyl PGF2 alpha):**  
For the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage secondary to uterine atony not responsive to conventional treatment (massage and oxytocin).  
The drug is supplied in 1 ml ampules containing 250 mcg of the drug.  
The clinical response may be enhanced with concomitant use of oxytocin.  
The drug must be refrigerated when stored.  
The total amount of drug given should not exceed 2 mg (8 doses).  
**Possible side effect of Hemabate:** Administer with caution to patients with active hepatic disease, cardiovascular disease, or asthma.  
The drug must be refrigerated when stored.  
**Cytotec® (misoprostol):** A synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog.  
During C-section, it is directly injected the myometrium to correct uterine atony.  
It is water soluble and is quickly absorbed after sublingual, oral, vaginal, and rectal use.  
**Dose:** The dose usually ranges between 800-1000 mcg.  
The drug undergoes a series of chemical reactions after ingestion, converting the agent to a prostaglandin F analog, making the drug very similar to Hemabate.  
Therefore, it is unlikely that Cytotec would be effective if Hemabate has failed, or vice versa.  
Unlike Hemabate, Cytotec DOES NOT appear to exacerbate bronchoconstriction in patients with asthma.  
Does not need to be refrigerated.  
  
**Possible side effects of Cytotec:  
**Diarrhea, shivering, pyrexia and headaches.
