High Molecular-Weight Kininogen Deficiency    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### High Molecular-Weight Kininogen Deficiency  
Also known as: Fitzgerald trait, Flaujeac trait, and Williams trait.

**Quick Note:** Patients with HMWK deficiency do NOT have a hemorrhagic tendency, but they exhibit abnormal surface-mediated activation of fibrinolysis. There is generally no clinical evidence of bleeding unless other contributing factors are present.  
  
**Type of HMWK deficiencies:  
**Fitzgerald trait represents a 'true' deficiency of HMWK.  
Flaujeac and Williams traits represent total kininogen deficiency, in which both HMWK and low molecular weight kininogen (LMWK) are deficient.  
  
High molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) deficiency is an autosomal recessive coagulation defect.  
  
**When to consider getting an assay for HMWK (and prekallikrein) for diagnosis  
**When a routine prolonged PTT evaluation has no explanation for the prolongation.  
The PTT is normal in the mixing study.  
Factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII are normal.  
The PT and fibrinogen are normal.  
Lupus anticoagulant assays are negative.  
  
**A factor assay for HMWK**  
The assay is similar to other coagulation factor assays.  
Patient plasma is mixed with HMWK-deficient plasma and a PTT is performed on the mixture.  
The amount of HMWK in the patient plasma is determined from a standard curve that plots known amounts of HMWK against PTT values.  
  
Hereditary HMWK deficiency conditions are inherited through an autosomal recessive pattern.
