Clavicular Fracture Repair     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Clavicular Fracture Repair

This repair can be accomplished using several different treatment options: intramedullary nails, screws or plates designed for midshaft fractures, or lateral clavicle fractures.  The lateral plates can be used to help stabilize the acromioclavicular joint in type II-B clavicular fractures. The clavicle is located between the sternum and the scapula, and it connects the arm to the body.

The clavicle lies above several important nerves and blood vessels. However, these vital structures are rarely injured when the clavicle breaks, even though the bone ends can shift when they are fractured. Most breaks occur in the middle of the clavicle. Occasionally, the bone will break where it attaches at the ribcage or shoulder blade.

A plate, screw or a pin fixation can be used to reduce the fracture.  
  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT or LMA. Tape the ETT away from the surgical site.  
An interscalene block can be performed, but it’s not sufficient for a proximal clavicular surgery.  
**Position:** Supine or Beach-chair.  
**Duration:** 60-90 minutes  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable. Make sure the BP cuff and IV are on the opposite side.  
**EBL:** less than 50 ccs.  
  
**Complications**:  
Damage to the brachial plexus and/or subclavian artery.

**Type I fracture of the distal clavicle (also a group II).**  
The intact ligaments hold the fragments in place.  
**A type II distal clavicle fracture.**  
In type II-A, both conoid and trapezoid ligaments are on the distal segment, while the proximal segment, without ligamentous attachments, is displaced.  
**A type IIB fracture of the distal clavicle.**  
The conoid ligament is ruptured while the trapezoid ligament remains attached to the distal segment. The proximal fragment is displaced.
