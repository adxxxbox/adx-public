Cholecystectomy - Open     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Cholecystectomy - Open

Surgically removing the gallbladder through an abdominal incision rather than the more common laparoscopic approach.   
(See notes to follow)  
  
The cystic duct and the cystic artery are identified, clipped with tiny titanium clips and cut. The Gallbladder is then dissected away from the liver bed and removed.

  
If you see a scheduled Open Cholecystectomy, you could assume the patient has had previous surgeries and the surgeon feels there are a lot of adhesions and scar tissue.  
  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
**EBL:** 20-100mLs  
**Position:** Supine with arms out or tucked. The bed should still be reversed in case the surgeon decides to do an IOC. The newer operating beds do not require the bed to be reversed. They have Foot and Head sliding “Modes” to adapt to X-ray and C-arm requirements.     
 

**Complications**  
Bleeding  
Perforation of the common bile duct with resultant bile leakage.  
Sub-hepatic abscess.  
Retained bile duct stones.  
   
**Indications**  
Failed laparoscopic attempt  
Previous multiple abdominal surgeries  
Acute Cholecystitis  
Symptomatic cholelithiasis  
Biliary Dyskinesia  
Gallbladder cancer  
Gallbladder trauma  
 

**More Notes**  
The gallbladder is located right below the liver in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen. The body of the gallbladder is attached to the liver and is about 4 inches long. It resembles a pear in shape.

The open cholecystectomy is rarely electively done anymore. Most of the open cholecystectomies today are originally attempted laparoscopically and then converted to an open procedure for various reasons.

The decision to convert to an open procedure should be made when important anatomic structures cannot be clearly identified or when no progress is being made. As a general rule, if the junction of the gallbladder and the cystic duct has not been identified within 30 minutes of the start of the operation, the procedure should be converted to an open cholecystectomy.
