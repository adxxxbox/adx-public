### Enterocele Repair

Enterocele is commonly seen in conjunction with stress urinary incontinence and a cystocele, or it may result from surgery to correct these problems.  
  
An enterocele is a vaginal hernia unique to women. It is a defect in the support tissues between the uterus and rectum, or the bladder and rectum in someone who has had a hysterectomy. This opening allows the small intestine to descend into the vagina. Enteroceles often occur along with rectoceles. They are repaired by closing the opening in the connective tissues at the top of the vagina.  
  
The enterocele can occur posteriorly with or without inversion of the vagina. The enterocele should be distinguished from a rectocele, for the procedure for surgical correction is different.   

  
**Anesthesia**: Same as anterior or posterior repair (A&P Repair).  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT.  
Spinal: Rare but completely appropriate.  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**Position:** Lithotomy, slight Trendelenburg with arms out.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
**EBL:** 50-100mL  
  
**Possible Complications**.  
Damage to the urethra, bladder, or vagina..  
Irritable bladder.  
Changes in the vagina (prolapsed vagina)..  
Urine leakage from the vagina or to the skin (fistula).  
Bleeding  
  
**More Notes**.  
An enterocele is a hernia of the peritoneal pouch of Douglas extending caudally between the vagina and rectum. It usually contains small bowel with or without omentum.  
  
**Nichols described four types of Enterocele:**.  
**Congenital enterocele:** The least common; this enterocele occurs when the anterior and posterior peritoneal folds fail to fuse during fetal development..  
**Pulsion enterocele**: Caused by a chronic increase in intra-abdominal pressure..  
**Traction enterocele:** Occurs when a pelvic organ, for example, the uterus, bladder, or rectum prolapses and causes traction on the vaginal vault and peritoneum..  
**Iatrogenic enterocele**: Occurs after hysterectomy when excess peritoneum is left behind or the pouch of Douglas is not adequately closed. It may also occur after any procedure that alters the vaginal axis..  
An enterocele can develop if the roof of the vagina is weak after surgery to remove the uterus.  
  
**Other causes of an Enterocele**.  
Aging  
Vaginal deliveries of heavy babies.  
Menopause  
Previous hysterectomy
