Factor VII    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Factor VII (Proconvertin, Serum Prothrombin Conversion Accelerator)

**Activates factors IX and X -** Initiates coagulation by activating factor IX (in the intrinsic pathway) and factor X (onset of common pathway) simultaneously with tissue factor in the extrinsic pathway.  
  
**Source:** Liver.  
Vitamin K dependent.  
  
**Pathway:** Extrinsic.  
  
**Half-life:** 4-6 hours.  
_Has the shortest half-life and is depleted first, within 2 days in vitamin K deficiency or liver disease._ However, Factor VII is in the extrinsic pathway and inhibition does NOT provide effective anticoagulation despite causing early INR elevation. (Managing Anticoagulated Patients in the Hospital. P.134).  
Other Vitamin K dependent factors take 3-10 days to be depleted. (Hematology and Practice, p.268).  
  
**Activated by:** Factor III (tissue factor).  
  
Acting with factor III to activate factor X which works with other factors to convert prothrombin into thrombin.  
Deficiency either hereditary or acquired (vitamin k deficiency).  
Deficiency may lead to epistaxis, menorrhagia, hematomas, hemarthrosis, digestive tract or cerebral hemorrhages.  
Deficiency of Factor VII prolongs PT but NOT PTT.

Factor VII is in the extrinsic pathway and affects PT and NOT “PTT” (PTT represents the Intrinsic pathway).  
_The gene for factor VII is located on the thirteenth chromosome (13q34-qter)._
