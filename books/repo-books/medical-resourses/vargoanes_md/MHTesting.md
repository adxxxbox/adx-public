## MH Susceptibility Testing

Note: Because of the high likelihood of newly unidentified gene mutations associated with MH susceptibility, genetic testing is NOT the gold standard for diagnosing MH.**  
  
Caffeine-Halothane Contracture Test (CHCT) -** _the gold standard_**  
(Most call it “Contracture Test”)**

**Muscle biopsy where they do contracture testing  
**This is an invasive test that is only done in certain facilities in the US and Canada.  
CHCT involves dissecting a piece of muscle from the vastus lateralis and suspended in a tissue bath. The muscle is then connected to an electrical source followed by the exposure to either Halothane or caffeine. Remember that Halothane is also a trigger to MH. If muscle tension is increased after the exposure to Halothane or caffeine, the patient is positive for MH. Halothane or caffeine will not increase muscle tension if the patient is not MH susceptible.

**Accuracy of CHCT  
**The Caffeine-Halothane Contracture Test is extremely reliable but not perfect  
  
**Sensitivity:** of the test is 97%  
Meaning that only 3% will have a false negative result.

**Specificity:** of the test is 78%  
Meaning around 22% will have a false positive

**Who is recommended for MH Genetic Testing**  
Someone who has had an MH Episode  
Someone who has had a positive contracture test  
Someone who has a family member with MH

If the genetic test has identified a specific mutation in a family, you can test other members for the same mutation. If the other family member has that same mutation, they are told they are MH susceptible.

**Genetic Testing Centers  
**Genetic DNA testing can be done with a blood sample sent to one of the two testing sites.
