### CSE Dosing the Epidural for C-section

  
CSE:(Combined Spinal Epidural)  
**_By Lisa Stiel Moreno, CRNA_**

A CSE may be used for a C-section, where the CSE surgical spinal dose administered alone should cover most C-sections via a dense block. Sometimes a C-section will last longer than the duration of the spinal dose administered and the patient will start to experience sharp surgical pain. The epidural catheter is still in place can be dosed appropriately to cover the pain.  
Even with long acting agents and vasoconstrictors, a complicated case can outlast the spinal.

**Factors that may prolong the duration of a C-section**  
Patient with a history of multiple repeat sections-having excess scar tissue  
Added bilateral Tubal Ligation procedure  
A very slow surgeon or resident

**CSE Epidural Dose for C-Section**  
If the epidural is required to provide surgical anesthesia, then initial dosing can be performed with whichever your drug of choice is. Lidocaine 2%, Marcaine 0.5%, or Ropivacaine 0.5% all provide adequate surgical anesthesia.

**I personally dose with Lidocaine 2% for multiple reasons:**  
1) If I do get a block that is higher than I wanted, it will recede rather quickly.  
2) Lidocaine is less toxic if the epidural is intravascular. Again, test dosing a CSE is not always  
clear, so erring on the side of caution is always best.  
3) It sets up rapidly.  
With that said, utilizing Ropivacaine or Marcaine for dosing is acceptable as well, and will provide for a longer block than Lidocaine.

In general, when bolusing the epidural the volume utilized will be anywhere from 3-5ml as a starting point with any of the above local anesthetics. You can always give more, but once given you can't take it away. Dosing incrementally and assessing your block is a very safe practice.
