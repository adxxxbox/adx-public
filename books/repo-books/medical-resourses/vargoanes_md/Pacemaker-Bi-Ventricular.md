### Pacemaker- Bi-Ventricular

Also known as cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).  
Usually seen with patients with an EF < 20%.  
When a person has heart failure, often the right and left ventricles do not pump together. And when the heart's contractions become out of sync, the left ventricle is not able to pump enough blood to the body. This eventually leads to an increase in heart failure.

CRT is designed to help both ventricles contract more normally. It keeps the right and left ventricles pumping together in a balanced way by sending well-coordinated small electrical impulses through the leads.

**Bi-ventricular pacemakers:** Are similar to dual-chamber pacemakers, but with a third lead placed in a cardiac vein that wraps around the back of the heart to stimulate the left ventricle. This allows for synchronized pacing. 

Most all CRTs are combined with an ICD, which is known as a CRT/ICD combination device. These devices can combine biventricular pacing with anti-tachycardia (fast heart rate) pacing and internal defibrillators (ICDs) to deliver treatment as needed.  
  
CRT may even lessen the amount of arrhythmia that occurs, decreasing the times the ICD needs to shock the heart. 

The biggest advantage of CRT is the improvement in the EF. EF can improve by 5-10%.  
It is not rare for a patient to increase his or her ejection fraction over 40%. It improves symptoms of heart failure in about 50% of the cases.

So as it states above, CRT has 2 or 3 leads that are positioned in the:  
Right atrium  
Right ventricle  
Left ventricle (via the coronary sinus vein)

**More Notes:  
  
Biventricular pacing (resynchronization therapy)**  
Has been shown to be an effective treatment for advanced heart failure in patients with major intraventricular conduction effects, predominately left bundle branch block.

In older patients, devices that maintain synchrony between atria and ventricles are preferred because they maintain the increased contribution of atrial contraction to ventricular filling necessary in this age group.

In general, rate-responsive devices are preferred because they more closely simulate the physiologic function of the sinus node.

Most pacemakers are demand pacemakers.  
Demand pacemakers have a sensing device which paces the heart (turns the device off and on) as needed: off when the heart beat is too fast and on when it is too slow. Patients are usually completely unaware when the device is pacing their heart.
