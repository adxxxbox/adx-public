### Eye Anatomy Terms

**Akinesia:** Immobility of the globe and the lids  
  
**Anterior Chamber:** The space between the cornea and iris that is filled with Aqueous Humour.

**Posterior Chamber:** The small aqueous-containing space directly posterior to the iris but anterior to the lens. The posterior chamber should not be confused with the vitreous chamber.  
**Aqueous Humour**: It is a transparent gelatinous fluid that is produced by the choroid plexus of the ciliary body. It fills the front of the eye between the lens and cornea and provides the cornea and lens with oxygen and nutrients. It drains back into the blood stream through the canals of Schlemm. The AH maintains the balance between the production and drainage, thus determining the eye’s Intraocular Pressure (IOP).    
**Canals of Schlemm:** These canals are located around the perimeter of the iris. They allow aqueous fluid to drain back into the blood stream. The Trabecular Meshwork along with the Canals of Schlemm regulate the eye’s internal pressure. With Glaucoma, these canals become blocked, leading to increased IOP. The increased pressure from this condition can destroy the optic nerve.

**Chalazion:** can occur as a single, painful, slowly enlarging nodule, or there may be multiple nodules that occur on the eyelid margin, as the result of blocked Meibomian gland(s) found between the tarsal plate and conjunctiva.

**Choroid**: A 2nd layer behind the retina (between the retina and sclera). It is layer of blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to the outer part of the retina. It is brown or black pigmented to prevent reflection by absorbing stray light rays.  
 

**Macular Degeneration:** When abnormal blood vessels grow into the space between the retina and choroid, thereby damaging the macula.

**Ciliary Body:** Contraction and relaxation of the ciliary muscle controls the shape of the lens. It also manufactures the aqueous. It changes the shape of the lens; this is called accommodation. It relaxes to flatten the lens for distance vision. For close vision, it contracts, thereby rounding out the lens. 

**Cones:** Cones are shaped light-sensitive cells in the retina, particularly the part known as the macula. The cones are mostly used during daylight when pupils are small. This permits a person to see details and shapes, especially colors.

**Conjunctiva**: The conjunctiva is a thin transparent mucous membrane that covers only the white of the eye; it keeps the eye from drying out.  Cells in this lining produce mucous that helps lubricate the eye. This is the eye’s first layer of protection against infection. Inflammation of this membrane is called conjunctivitis, or pink eye.  
 

**Cornea:** The cornea is a strong curved transparent bulge located at the front of the eye that begins refraction. It replaces the sclera that forms the outside surface of the rest of the eye. The front surface of the adult cornea has a radius of approximately 8mm. The cornea contributes to the image-forming process by refracting light entering the eye.

**Extraocular muscles:** These are the tiny muscles that surround the eye and control its movements. There are six (4 are rectus): the lateral rectus, medial rectus, superior oblique, inferior oblique, superior rectus and inferior rectus. The primary function of the four rectus muscles is to control the eye’s movements from left to right and up and down. The two oblique muscles rotate the eyes inward and outward. All six muscles work in unison; when the muscles do not function properly, the condition is called strabismus. 

**Fovea**: Near the center of the Macula. (REMEMBER- the Macula is that yellow spot near the center of the retina, and the retina is like that movie screen on the back of the eye). The Fovea contains most of the “cone cells” in the eye. It is responsible for sharp “Central Vision”, also called foveal vision, which is necessary in humans for reading, watching, driving, and any activity where visual detail is of primary importance.

**Hyaloid:** This is a membrane that encloses the vitreous body. It is sometimes called the Hyaloid canal, Cloquet’s canal or Stilling’s canal. The anterior hyaloid diaphragm divides the aqueous humour from the vitreous humour. The posterior hyaloid separates the posterior portion of the vitreous from the retina.

**Iris:** This is the colored part of the eye of variable size, whose function is to adjust the size of the pupil (the black part of the eye) to regulate the amount of light admitted into the eye. If there is a lot of light, muscles in the iris constrict to let less light in. These muscles also expand when there is less light.

**Pupil**: (the black part of the eye) is the aperture through which light - and hence the images we "see" and "perceive" - enter the eye.  As the size of the iris increases (or decreases) the size of the pupil decreases (or increases) correspondingly.

**Lacrimal Gland or Tear Duct:** The lacrimal gland sits above the eye. This gland continually releases tears and other protective fluids down onto the surface of the eye. It lubricates and keeps the cornea from becoming dehydrated.

**Lacrimal Sac**: A tiny pump that drains tears and other debris from the eye. The fluids flow down the **nasolacrimal duct** into the nose where they help keep the nasal linings moist. This is why your nose runs when you cry.  
  
**Lens:** It is a transparent, elastic structure responsible for focusing images back onto the retina.  The lens will change shape to accommodate for objects that are near or far away. It is enclosed in a tough capsule. The lens is held in place by the suspensory ligaments, which are operated by the ciliary body. The lens has a biconvex shape. A **cataract** is an opacification of the lens, obstructing light from focusing on the retina.  
 

**Lens Sack or Capsule**: This is the outermost layer of the lens. During modern cataract surgery, the outer membrane of the lens is left in place. The artificial intraocular lens is placed in this sack.

**Macula:** This is an oval-shaped highly pigmented yellow spot (disc) near the center of the retina. Has a diameter of around 1.5 mm.  It allows humans to see things in finer detail. It is the location of a person's sharpest vision. The macula acts as a natural sunblock (analogous to sunglasses) for this area of the retina. Within the macula are the fovea and foveola, which contain a high density of cones, photoreceptors with high acuity. Damage to the macula will result in loss of central vision. The macula is lateral to the blind spot or optic disc.  
  
**Macular Denegation:** The progressive destruction of the macula and can sometimes lead to the creation of a macular hole.

**A macular pucker** (also called an epiretinal membrane) is a layer of scar tissue that grows on the surface of the retina, particularly the macula, which is the part of your eye responsible for detailed, central vision

**Optic Discs**: A blind spot located in the area where the retina leaves the eye and becomes the optic nerve. It has no rods or cones there. 

**Optic Nerve:** The optic nerve is the second cranial nerve and is responsible for vision. Each nerve contains approximately one million fibers transmitting information from the rod and cone cells of the retina. Cranial nerve II carries the nerve impulse to the thalamus and then to the occipital lobe of the cerebrum, where vision is located.

**Papilla**  
The papilla is also known as the "blind spot" and is located at the position from which the optic nerve leaves the retina.

**Pars plana:** simply refers to an area of the eye that may safely be entered to perform surgery in the posterior segment of the eye, where the retina is located.

**Photoreceptor Cells (Cones and Rods):** The retina is composed of these two types of photoreceptor cells. When light falls on one of these cells, it causes a chemical reaction that sends an electrical signal to the brain.

**Cone cells:** These cells give us our detailed color daytime vision. There are 6 million of them in each human eye. Most of them are located in the central retina, the macula fovea area. There are three types of cone cells: one sensitive to red light, another to green light, and the third sensitive to blue light.  
**Rod cells:** These cells are about 500 times more sensitive to light then cone cells. Rod Cells give us our dim light or night vision. They are also more sensitive to motion then cone cells. There are 120 million rod cells in the human eye. Most rod cells are located in our peripheral or side vision.

**Retina:** The retina is the thin tissue lining the back of the eye (the first layer). The retina is smooth and flat like a movie screen, and is responsible for capturing a clear image. The original image is passed into the eye via the cornea, aqueous humour, pupil, and lens, then the hyaloid and finally the vitreous humour, before reaching the retina. The retina contains photosensitive elements (called rods and cones) that convert the observed light into nerve impulses which are then sent onto the brain along the optic nerve.

 **Sclera:** The tough white sheath around the outside of the eye; commonly called the white of the eye. It is made of strong, fibrous tissue and keeps the eye safe. The extrinsic eye muscles attach the sclera for eye movement.  
  
 **Vitreous: A**lso known as the "vitreous body", it is a jelly-like substance. It maintains intraocular pressure, which keeps the eyeball from collapsing.  
  
**Vitreous Cavity:** is located behind the lens and in front of the retina. It is filled with vitreous humor.
