Nasal Polypectomy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Nasal Polypectomy

Nasal Polypectomy is the removal of polyps that can be done endoscopically via the nares. Nasal polyps affect 2-5% of the population.

Nasal polyps are commonly associated with Samter’s triad: a syndrome of being allergic or sensitive to ASA, asthma, and nasal polyps. The chance of the polyps growing back after a polypectomy is around 30%.

**Anesthesia**: Just another Endoscopic Sinus Surgery.  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT with an oral Rae; and consider an LTA kit.  
**Muscle relaxant:** Theoretically, the patient does not need to be relaxed, but we usually do to avoid coughing.  
**Inhalation Agent:** Sevo or Forane are popular for these procedures.

**Duration**: 45-90 minutes  
**EBL:** 10-50 mLs.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
**Positioning:** Supine with the HOB up 10-20 degrees or reverse T-berg. Tuck the arm on the side of the bed where the surgeon will sit or stand. Sometimes the bed is rotated 90 degrees.

**Antiemetics**: Yes, give Decadron and Zofran.

**NGT**: For the surgeon to pass ORALLY after the throat pack is out.  
Avoid hypertension: To minimize bleeding, stay within 20% of the patient’s base BP. Consider a beta-blocker with emergence. You can titrate your inhalation agent to the desired BP.  
**Emergence:** Smooth, avoid coughing. Xylocaine .25 mg/kg will suppress coughing.

Consider Robinul to prevent secretions from draining onto and agitating the vocal cords. Gently suction the oral pharynx with a catheter (not a Yankauer). At the end of the operation, it is not unusual to have a pack or a sponge dressing in each nostril to soak up any blood. This is kept in for a few hours. The patient is now an obligate mouth breather.  
**Extubation**: Deep or Awake? Many CRNAs will extubate deep. Some patients may require an awake extubation, so try to make it smooth. Some CRNAs insert an LMA immediately after a deep extubation and transport the patient to the recovery room. The LMA is removed when the patient awakes. This drastically decreases turnover time.

**Possible Complications**:Infection  
Bleeding  
Subdural  
Orbital complications
