Portacath Insertion     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### **Portacath Insertion**

A Portacath is an implanted venous access device for patients who need frequent or continuous administration of chemotherapy.  
A Portacath consists of a reservoir (the portal) and a tube (the catheter).

Most surgeons use an ultrasound machine to access the right subclavian vein just along the clavicle. The Seldinger technique (using a guide wire) is the most common. You need to observe the surgeon as he/she is accessing the subclavian because they could cause a pneumothorax. If the surgeon is having difficulty and performing multiple needle punctures, you better be vigilant. 1-3% of these cases become critical.  
Remember, the lung’s upper lobes extend a little above the clavicles which makes it an easy pneumothorax waiting to happen. So if the patient starts grunting or coughing with any drop in your SaO2, alert the surgeon immediately. They should already have a C-arm in the room and could take a quick look to verify a pneumothorax.  
After the surgeon threads the guide wire down the selected large vein, observe your monitor for ectopy because the wire is probably too far down tickling the right atrium. Inform the surgeon and the guidewire will be pulled back. Placement will be immediately verified by the C-arm.  
Next the surgeon will make a small skin incision on the chest wall to create a pocket for the port to sit.  
A dilator and sheath is inserted over the guide wire. The wire and dilator are removed. The port catheter is tunneled up and is inserted through the peel away sheath and the tip is positioned at the SVC atrial junction.  
The catheter is then aspirated and flushed and attached to the port.

**Anesthetic:** Usually Deep MAC (room air general) with NC monitoring ETCO2.

**Common cocktail:** 2mg versed, 2cc fentanyl, propofol infusion and a small propofol bolus prior to local injection.

**Two stimulating parts to consider:** When the surgeon injects the local anesthetic to BOTH the insertion site and the pocket site. Some CRNAs ask the surgeon for a 30 second warning before the local injection, to give them time to administer Propofol and take affect.

**Duration:** 30-60 minutes

**Position:** Supine, arms tucked. Sometimes the surgeon will request the nurse to pull the arm of the insertion side towards the foot for better access. Some Trendelenburg before the insertion to fill the vein and make the puncture easier. The bed is leveled back out after the guide wire is verified.

**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.

**Possible Complications:**  
Pneumothorax  
Hemothorax  
accessing the right common carotid artery rather than the vein wound infection

**More Notes:**

**Why the right internal jugular vein is preferred?**

The vein is large and superficial, easily visualized with ultrasound. It runs a straight course towards the right atrium. This vein has the lowest risk of complication associated with insertion and subsequent usage. The left internal jugular vein is the second best.

**Another Method of Insertion**  
The venous cutdown with ultrasound And it doesn't take me any longer than the Seldinger technique. Using the jugular approach, it avoids pinching of the catheter between the clavicle and the first rib which you see with a subclavian puncture. The portacath can be left in place for several years. There are monthly flushes of heparinized saline into the port, so that the port doesn’t clot.

**The position of the catheter**

The catheter is placed through the right internal jugular vein and into the right brachiocephalic vein. The tip of the catheter is then placed more inferiorly at the junction of the right atrium and the superior vena cava. The reason for placing the catheter in such a position relates to the agents that are infused. Most chemotherapeutic agents are severely cytotoxic (kill cells) and enabling good mixing with the blood prevents thrombosis and vein wall irritation.
