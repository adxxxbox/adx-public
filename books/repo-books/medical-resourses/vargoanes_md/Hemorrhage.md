## Hemorrhage

**Team Leader  
**The team leader is the person who declares a massive hemorrhage situation; this is usually the surgeon or anesthesia provider at the scene. Their role is to direct and co-ordinate the management of the patient with massive hemorrhage.

**Treatment:**  
Tell the OR circulator to call anesthesia STAT and the blood bank to initiate “Massive Transfusion Protocol.” Verify with the surgeon on the seriousness of the hemorrhage.  
Call for cell salvage autotransfusion STAT.

Open IV fluids (crystalloid or colloid) and elevate IV bag/pole.

Increase to 100% O2, lower inhalation agent.  
If the patient’s arm(s) is out, consider a large bore antecubital IV or a central line via neck.  
Start an arterial line.  
If the patient has blood on standby, have it picked up stat.  
If the patient is already Type and Crossed or screened, have the blood bank send some as soon as possible. Sometimes an OR tech will pick the blood up.  
Consider starting Neosynephrine and titrate to affect while immediately giving volume. (Note-Neosynephrine may not be your first choice, but if you already have it on standby-you can have it infusing within seconds).  
Prime IV blood transfusing tubing with a fluid warmer.  
Request a Level 1 or Belmont Rapid Infuser.  
Set blood transfusion tubing up with a fluid warmer(s).

Actively warm the patient.  
Tranexamic acid administration-follow hospital protocol if you have one.

**A cooler of blood arrives from the blood bank (Give it all).  
**Group O negative blood is always supplied first (unless there is already type and crossed PRBCs already in the room.

**Start infusing the following:** (but always follow your institutions protocol)  
  
2 Units of O Negative blood then

4 PRBs then 4 FFP then Cryoprecipitate  
Try and transfuse a ratio of 1FFP to 1 PRBCs  
(remember, PRBCs do not have clotting factors and FFP does)  
Transfuse Platelets if indicated (1 six pack of Platelets per 6 PRBCs)  
  
Newer Massive Blood Transfusion protocols will deliver O negative or positive for males and always O negative for females.

After the first cooler of blood products are completed, draw blood for a TEG, CBC, ABG and CMP. Most advanced facilities utilize TEGs.

**When your second cooler of blood products arrive:**  
Repeat the administration of the cooler and repeat labs.  
Repeat the above and titrate blood products with repeat TEG and labs.

**Further management:  
**Once the bleeding is controlled, you should focus on maintaining blood pressure, acid-base status and temperature. If possible, vasopressors should be avoided because organ perfusion is still your primary concern.  
Aggressively warming the patient is still important.  
Coagulopathy should be anticipated and treated.
