### Ankle Arthroscopy

**Indications:** For the surgical evaluation and treatment of a variety of ankle conditions. 

**Basic Arthroscopic Ankle Procedures:** 

Diagnostic Ankle Arthroscopy  
Synovectomy  
Removal of loose bodies.  
Treatment of osteochondritis dissecans.   
Removal of osteophytes.

**Anesthetic: Mostly** General/LMA. Sometimes a regional involving Popliteal block. Either way, you might have to put them to sleep due to the discomforting tourniquet.

If an effective Popliteal block is done and the tourniquet is placed on the calf, a deep MAC can be performed.

**Tourniquet location:** Usually placed on the thigh; rarely on the calf.  
**Duration:** 30-90 minutes

**Position:** Supine with arms out.  
The patient may need to be further down on the operating room bed with the knee positioned slightly past the distal break point of the bed. The end of the bed is dropped so that both limbs will initially angle at 90°.

The Surgical leg is placed in an arthroscopic leg holder (like a knee scope).

A padded bar is behind the thigh and opposite limb should be padded.

**EBL:** Minimal

**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable

**Complications:** Traction induced nerve damage.

After surgery, the ankle will be wrapped in a soft bandage or splint.  
If the surgeon is making a splint, do not remove the LMA too soon because you don’t want the patient moving their ankle while the splint is drying.

**Traction to the ankle:**  
A strap is placed around the ankle and connected to a second bar distal to the first, which is attached to the operating table. This allows traction to be placed across the ankle. In this way the ankle is stretched open sufficiently to allow a space with sufficient dimensions to operate. Unfortunately, nerve damage has been reported with traction, which seems to spook many surgeons.
