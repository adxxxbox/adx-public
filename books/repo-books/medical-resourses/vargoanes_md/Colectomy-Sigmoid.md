Sigmoid Colectomy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Sigmoid Colectomy

The left side of the colon has four sections: the descending colon, the sigmoid colon, the rectum, and the anus. Part or all of the sigmoid colon is removed. The descending colon is then re-anastomosed to the rectum. If the cancer is low enough, this procedure will be similar to a Low Anterior Resection. If the procedure is laparoscopic, you won’t have to hydrate as much because it is not an open belly case, thus less insensible water loss.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
**Nitrous Oxide:** No  
**Duration:** 1-3 hours  
**IV Access:** 1 18G for a laparoscopic case, and 2 for an open procedure.  
**Typed and Screened**: Yes  
**OG Tube:** Yes, unless the surgeon wants an NG tube. NG tubes are becoming rarer.  
**A-Line:** Usually not indicated.  
**Neo Drip:** On standby.  
**EBL:** 50-200 mLs; blood loss depends on the degree of pathology, type of patient: healthy or feeble with co-morbidities, surgeon’s skills and if the case is an open procedure.  
**Position:** Lithotomy and usually some Trendelenburg.  
**Bowel Prep:** Usually.  
**Fluid Deficit:** 1-2 liters. The patient probably had a bowel prep and NPO. Pre-hydration is probably needed.  
**Foley**: Yes  
 

**Possible Complications**  
Hemorrhage  
Anastomotic Complications: leak, stenosis, et. al.  
DVT  
Small bowel obstruction; post-op ileus  
Anesthesia Risk  
Splenic Injury

If the cancer is low enough, it will be similar to a Low Anterior Resection by involving another person inserting an End to End Anastomotic stapler into the rectum for the surgeon to complete the anastomosis between the rectum and sigmoid.  
It’s the most difficult part of the procedure. After the anastomosis, the pelvis is filled with saline and a proctoscope is inserted into the rectum. The rectum is filled with air, and the absence of air bubbles in the saline confirms the stapler created an airtight seal at the new bowel connection. If the cancer is higher, a left sided anastomosis will be done.
