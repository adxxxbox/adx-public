### Aortic Stenosis (AS) and Anesthesia

**_Primary goal:_** _Maintain SVR and cardiac output (CO)_  
  
_Patients with AS do NOT tolerate hypotension.  
Neuraxial anesthesia (especially spinals) is relatively contraindicated because a sympathectomy may cause an abrupt drop in afterload (SVR) and may NOT be tolerated._  
  
**Aortic valvular area dimensions:**  
**Normal area:** 2.5-4.5 cm2  
**Mild stenosis:** 1.0-2.5 cm2  
**Moderate stenosis:** 0.75-1.0 cm2  
**Severe stenosis:** < 0.75 cm2  
  
**Hemodynamically significant stenosis:** < 1.2 cm2 but not necessarily symptomatic  
**Symptomatic aortic stenosis:** < 0.8-0.9 cm2  
**Critical aortic stenosis:** < 0.7 cm2 (mean gradient >50 mmHg)  
  
As stenosis increases, the pressure gradient across the valve increases.  
**Aortic valve mean gradient**  
**Normal gradient:** < 5 mmHg  
**Mild stenosis:** 5-25 mmHg  
**Moderate stenosis:** 25-50 mmHg  
**Severe stenosis:** >50 mmHg (area < 0.7 cm2)  
  
**With severe aortic stenosis:**  
Chest compressions are essentially useless.  
A defibrillator should be readily available.  
  
**Maintain sinus rhythm:** CO is very dependent on atrial contraction to fill the left ventricle (LV). Treat a-fib immediately.

Pre-op Labs**

| Parameter | Goal | Indicated | Relatively Contraindicated |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Heart rate | Normal to sinus rhythm | Restore sinus rhythm  
Beta-blockers for tachycardia | Potent volatile agents  
High doses |
| Preload | Normal to high | IV fluids | NTG, thiopental and propofol |
| Afterload | High | Neosynephrine | Nipride, neuraxial anesthesia  
or anything that decreases SVR,  
High doses of  
inhalation agents |
| Contractility | Normal to increased | Epi (careful of increased HR)  
Norepinephrine | High doses of beta blocker |

**Heart Rate (HR):** Avoid bradycardia and especially tachycardia.  
Loss of atrial contraction (junctional rhythm or A-fib) may cause a drastic decrease in stoke volume (SV) and blood pressure.  
Consider esmolol for treatment of sinus tachycardia.  
A decrease in HR can cause over distention of the LV.  
  
**Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT):****Preload:** Maintain, decreased ventricular compliance with concentric hypertrophy requires a higher filling pressure.**Warning:** A high filling pressure may reflect a low LV compliance and diastolic dysfunction and not the true LVEDP. TEEs are best for assessing this.  
_Optimize fluids to maintain venous return and LV filling._**Afterload:** Maintain and AVOID a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR).  
With an elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and left ventricular hypertrophy, a higher afterload is necessary to maintain coronary perfusion pressure.  
  
_Spinal anesthesia is a “relative” contraindication because a sympathectomy may cause an abrupt drop in afterload (SVR) and may NOT be tolerated.  
  
_**For hypotension:** Treat immediately with an alpha agonist.  
Hypotension may reduce coronary perfusion resulting in myocardial ischemia, causing decreased LV function and cardiac output (CO).  
Phenylephrine is the drug of choice for an anesthesia-related decrease in SVR.  
Low dose of diluted vasopressin, 1-2 units may be considered.  
  
Be cautious using ephedrine or other drugs that may produce tachycardia.  
Trendelenburg may be considered.  
  
**Contractility:** Normal or increased  
**Vasodilators:** Avoid  
**Frequent PVCs:** treat with IV lidocaine.  
**Ventricular dysrhythmias:** Have lidocaine, amiodarone and a defibrillator available.  
_External and internal chest compressions are typically ineffective because it may be impossible to create an adequate volume across the aortic stenotic valve._  
  
**Anesthesia:** Inhalation agents or TIVA can be used.  
  
**Regional anesthesia:** Epidural- and spinal- induced sympathectomy may lead to profound hypotension.  
**Induction:** Etomidate is induction agent of choice since it does not decrease SVR.  
Propofol decreases SVR and should be avoided.  
An opioid induction agent may also be useful if the LV function is compromised.  
**Phenylephrine drip:** Should be already connected prior to induction.  
Phenylephrine syringe should be available with induction.  
**Ketamine:** Avoid since it may cause tachycardia.  
**Inhalation agents:** They all decrease SVR and can be counteracted with a phenylephrine drip.  
**Nitrous oxide:** Acceptable  
**Muscle Relaxant:** Vecuronium or rocuronium.  
Pancuronium increases HR and may be cautiously used in the presence of a slow HR.  
**Narcotics:**  
**Cardiac defibrillator:** Should be readily available for severe aortic stenosis  
  
**Emergence:** Avoid tachycardia  
Consider sugammadex over neostigmine and (Robinul®) for the reversal of muscle relaxation to avoid heart rate fluctuations.  
Have esmolol readily available.
