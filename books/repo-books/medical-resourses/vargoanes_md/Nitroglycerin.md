# Nitroglycerin

**Nitroglycerine (Tridil, NTG)**  
Cardene has been replacing nitroglycerine in the perioperperatively.  
**Class:** Organic Nitrate  
Primarily a venous dilator (lesser degree-arteriolar dilator).  
Nipride dilates both.  
Dilates large coronary arteries.  
Comes in a bottle, usually 25mg/250 mL bottle (100mcg/mL).  
**Doses:**  
In anesthesia, we mostly titrate NTG to effect because there is not a real optimal dose.  
In **mcg/kg/min**\-Initial dose of 0.2mcg/kg min.  
**Range:** 0.2 -1.5 mcg/kg/min, increasing increments of 0.1 mcg/kg/min Q 3-5 minutes.  
**In mcg/min:** (5-200mcg/min)  
Most just start at 5mL/hr (8mcg/min) and titrate from there.  
A diluted syringe, 1ml of NTG mixed with 4mL of any crystalloid in a 5cc syringe always comes in handy.  
**MOA:** NTG is converted to nitric oxide (NO) in the body by mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, and NO then stimulates cGMP to cause peripheral vasodilation.  
**Increases ICP:** Yes, cerebral dilates  
**Elimination halfime:** 1.5 minutes  
**NTG and Other Organs:**  
Relaxes smooth muscles of airways and GI tract.  
Relaxes smooth muscle of the biliary tract.  
Relaxes Sphincter of Oddi.  
Decreases Esophageal muscle tone.  
Relaxes ureteral and uterine smooth muscle tone.  
May inhibit HPV and worsen gas exchange in ARDS patients.  
**NTG and CV Notes**  
Up to 2mcg/kg/min-predominantly dilates veins over arterioles.  
It decreases preload and, to a lesser effect, afterload.  
Decreases venous return with venodilation.  
Decreases right and left end diastolic pressure.  
Decreases CO (from decreased venous return).  
Decreases PVR.  
It helps to increase coronary artery perfusion and decrease myocardial oxygen demand.  
Patients with high preload (particularly high PA pressures) may benefit from IV NTG.  
It will lower PA pressures and CVP via its vasodilatory action.  
Increases coronary blood flow to ischemic subendocardial areas.  
May produce coronary steal syndrome.  
  
**NTG Notes (for anesthesia)**  
Sublingual NTG 0.3mg is the most popular.  
Not as popular in anesthesia as it once was.  
Mostly CABGs, AAAs and Carotids -manually titrating to effect.  
Some Carotids: not used as much, being replaced by labetalol.  
It helps to increase coronary artery perfusion and decrease myocardial oxygen demand.  
Patients with high preload (particularly high PA pressures) may benefit from IV NTG.  
It will lower PA pressures and CVP via its vasodilatory action.  
NTG is preferred wit suspected ischemia due to its ability to dilate coronary arteries and increase coronary blood flow.  
Coronary artery dilatation is dose dependent.  
Also used short term (24-48 hours) to prevent spasm of internal mammary arteries in the postoperative environment.  
Abrupt discontinuation can cause coronary vasospasm.  
It has also been replacing Ca Channel Blockers to prevent radial artery graft spasms during CABG.
