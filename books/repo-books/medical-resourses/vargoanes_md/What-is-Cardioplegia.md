### What is Cardioplegia

Cardioplegia is the intentional and temporary cessation of the heart. (Cardio: heart; and plegia: paralysis). In the operating room, this term is also used to describe a solution that causes the cessation of the heart.

-   Many cardioplegic solutions exist.
-   All contain high concentrations of potassium; ensuring hyperkalemic arrest.
-   Solutions may be cold or warm.
-   All decrease the myocardial oxygen concentration by 97%.
-   Solution may be delivered through small cannulas, either anterograde or retrograde. Commonly, both anterograde and retrograde infusion are used.
-   **Antegrade** infusion is the more common; the aortic root is cannulated. This is the direction of normal coronary blood flow.
-   **Retrograde** infusion is in the reverse direction of coronary artery blood flow. It is useful when there is a severe proximal stenosis of the coronary arteries, aortic insufficienty, or valve surgery.
