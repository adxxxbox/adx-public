NICU Cases   

### NICU Cases

**What to Expect**

**Gestation:** Almost always < 36 weeks  
**Weight:** 1-3kg (underweight)  
**Intubated:** Yes, with pulmonary issues  
**High frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV)** Sometimes. See HFOV notes below  
**Ventilator settings** : Usually well managed by the neonatologist  
**Chest Tubes:** Sometimes  
**IV Access:** Usually already has access  
**Arterial line-** Usually a UA (uterine arterial) line.

**Central line** : Sometimes

**Pressors:** May already be on: Dopamine 3-5mcg/kg/min or Epinephrine at 0.05-0.2 mcg/kg/min

**_Note: The infant with the distended abdomen is peripherally shut down and the anesthetist has to compromise on monitoring the infant and usually start the surgical procedure with peripheral lines onl.y_**

**Pre-op Assessments  
ABGs-** may have metabolic acidosis. Remember HCO3 replacement dose is  
0.2 x weight (kg) x base deficit.  
  
**Labs:**  
Do you have access to an Istat machine in case of a large blood loss etc?

CBC/BMP/PT/PTT and ionized Ca.  
Is there blood available? The nurses will supply you with a syringe pump to give blood if needed.

**Urine Output-** Evaluate the amount of urine output to gauge intravascular volume (2 ml/ kg/h).

**Remember-** The neonatal liver does not easily clear the citrate found in blood products. Citrate also binds with serum Ca and can cause hypocalcemia. The neonatal heart is really dependent on the iCa.

Hb/Hct- keep >35%, PRBCs and FFP are both 10mLs/kg.

**Head Bleed** - If an intraventricular hemorrhage is present (many neonates have them), be careful with BP swings of 20-30mmHg can aggravate the hemorrhage.

**For Procedure in the NICU**  
If you are in the NICU there is not an anesthesia machine. TIVA is the anesthetic delivery choice in these situations.

**All you have to do is to show up with an anesthesia cart with a few pre-drawn up meds:**  
**Muscle relaxant-** in a 1cc syringe-usually Rocuronium (0.25-0.5mg/kg)  
**Narcotic-** in a 1cc syringe-usually Fentanyl (20-30mcg/kg is common for TIVA)  
(See narcotic note below)

**IV Fluids:** We usually just continue their dextrose containing IV fluids to prevent hypoglycemia. We usually piggy back our meds in.

High infusion rates of 20 ml/kg/h together with boluses of 5% albumin may be required as replacement fluid to maintain adequate circulating volume. A good urine output (2 ml kg/h) may reflect an adequate perfusion pressure and hence correlate with an increased survival from an episode of severe NEC.

**Albumin-** We tend to treat hypotension with volume before pressors.  
  
**Blood bolus if needed** : 10mL/kg

Blood loss needs to be replaced with blood, fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), and albumin. Coagulopathy as indicated by constant oozing at the surgical field requires platelets and FFP transfusion.  
**Extension tubing:** Connected to a 10cc syringe with a 3 way stopcock.  
You can give all your meds through the stopcock because you may not be able to have close access to the neonate.  
**Emergency Meds:** Atropine and Epinephrine.  
**Back up airway equipment:** 2.5,3.0 and 3.5mm ETT with a miller blade  
  
**Temperature:** The patients presenting are usually poikilothermic. Therefore body temperature monitoring and active warming measures, including a warm theatre, a forced-air blanket, and warmed I.V. fluids, are essential.

**Emergence:** None, the infant remains intubated.

**Possible Complications  
**Hemorrhage - Intraoperative liver hemorrhage is a known lethal complication of NEC surgery and is especially seen in infants with lower preoperative mean arterial pressure and in those requiring larger fluid resuscitation before operation.  
ROP  
Metabolic Acidosis or sepsis  
Pulmonary Edema  
3rd spacing and hypovolemia

**Ventilation and HFOV (** High Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation)

**Notes**  
HFOV may be utilized when there is a failure of conventional ventilation due to severe RDS, PIE, pulmonary hypoplasia or to reduce barotrauma when conventional ventilator settings are high.

High Frequency Oscillatory ventilation is a type of mechanical ventilation that uses a constant distending pressure (mean airway pressure \[MAP\]) with pressure variations oscillating around the MAP at very high rates (up to 900 cycles per minute). This creates small tidal volumes, often less than the dead space.

**More Notes**  
**Narcotic Note:**

_Preterm babies show an increased neuroendocrine response. Induction with a high dose of opioid (e.g. fentanyl 10 mcg/ kg body weight or an equivalent dose of remifentanil or sufentanil) helps blunt the systemic stress response that creates the postoperative catabolism and substrate mobilization. The surgical stress response lasts longer in preterm infants than in full-term babies and adults._

_The neonate’s long-term exposure to narcotics and benzodiazepines for sedation can develop a higher tolerance therefore requiring higher doses. If in the operating room you can possibly for go inhalation agents if you continue the usual NICU IV sedation and add narcotic and paralytic._
