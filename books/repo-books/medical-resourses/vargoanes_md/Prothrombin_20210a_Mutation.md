Prothrombin 20210a Mutation    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Prothrombin 20210a Mutation

**Also named:  
**Prothrombin G20210A mutation.  
Prothrombin G20210A gene polymorphism.  
Prothrombin gene mutation.  
FII A20210 mutation.  
  
First reported in 1996 as a familial cause of venous thromboembolism.  
2nd most common inherited risk factor for VTEs after factor V Leiden mutation.  
Arterial thrombosis is rare.  
  
**Genetics:** Autosomal dominant  
Polymorphism in the untranslated end of the prothrombin gene results in elevated synthesis of prothrombin.  
  
Prothrombin 20210a mutation results in increased levels of plasma prothrombin resulting in a 2-8-fold increase risk for thrombosis-VTEs.  
  
**Risk Factors  
**Oral contraceptives.  
Pregnancy.  
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT).  
Having another prothrombic issue - ex Factor V Leiden.  
  
**Incidence:** 2-5% of population - more prevalent in whites of southern European descent than in those of northern European descent, and it is rarely seen in Asians or Africans.  
  
**Differential Diagnosis -** _all cause thrombosis_  
Factor V Leiden mutation.  
Protein C or S deficiency.  
Antithrombin deficiency.  
Dysfibrinogenemia.  
Dysplasminogemia.  
Hemocystinemia.  
Elevated factor VIII levels.  
  
**Initial Lab Tests -** evaluation of new clot to differentiate possibilities.  
**Note:** _An elevated prothrombin concentration is NOT specific enough to make a diagnosis._  
CBC with peripheral smear.  
PT/INR, aPTT and thrombin time.  
Lupus anticoagulant.  
Antiphospholipid antibodies.  
Factor VIII.  
Activated protein C resistance.  
Protein S antigen and resistance.  
Antithrombin III assay.  
Fibrinogen.  
Factor V Leiden.  
Prothrombin G20210A.  
Homocystein.  
DNA analysis for mutation.  
**  
Treatment  
**First thrombosis - LMWH and Warfarin.  
Initiate warfarin with heparin on the first treatment day and discontinue heparin after 5 days when INR > 2.  
Enoxaparin, Fondparinux, Tinzaparin and Daltaparin are all options.
