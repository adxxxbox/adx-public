IV primed tubing with T-connector or something with a stopcock close to site

IV starting catheters etc equip

LR or Plasmalyte, (DON’T use .9% NS because can cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis)

For neonate –can use 50-60 cc syringe on syringe pump for maintenance

10-30kg kid-use Buretrol with 500 cc bag

for > 30kg, use 500cc bag with micro drip tubing

  

**When to use a Buretrol**  
The Buretrol is used as a safety mechanism so you don’t accidentally administer or bolus most or the entire 500cc bag above it. The Buretrol holds only 150cc and that’s all the patient can accidentally be given (if you accidentally let your IV run wide open).

It your patient is big and healthy enough to handle an accidental bolus of 300 -500cc IV, then you do not need to hang a Buretrol.

One experienced CRNA told me that if the patient needs an emergency 20cc/kg emergency bolus, and the calculated bolus volume exceeds the 150cc Buretrol, than she would not use a Buretrol. You do not need to be wasting time refilling a Buretrol during an emergency.

Policies vary with facilities on the age or weight range for utilizing a Buretrol with a pediatric patient.

Some facilities expect students to use a Buretrol for ages up to 5 years of age just to be safe.
