### Journavx (suzetrigine)

A novel non-opioid oral medication that has the potential for preoperative and postoperative pain management.

**Mechanism of action**

It is a first-in-class, oral, non-opioid, highly selective pain signal inhibitor that is selective for NaV1.8 relative to other NaV channels.

NaV1.8 is a voltage-gated sodium channel selectively expressed in peripheral pain-sensing neurons (nociceptors), including dorsal root ganglion neurons, whose role is to transmit pain signals (action potentials) to the spinal cord.

**Journavx side effects include:**

Itching (2.1%)

Muscle spasms (1.3%)

Increased blood level of creatine phosphokinase (0.5%)

Rash (0.5%)

**Contraindications:**

Patients receiving strong CYP3A inhibitors.

Patients allergic to Journavx

Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).

_**Note:** See CYP3A vs CYP3A4 notes at the bottom._

**Renal Impairment**

Avoid use of JOURNAVX in patients with renal impairment of eGFR < 15 mL/min.

**Recommended dosing:**

The recommended starting dose is 100 mg orally on an empty stomach.

Avoid grapefruit products.

Grapefruit inhibits CYP3A4, which is responsible for the metabolism of Journavx...

Starting 12 hours after the initial dose, take 50 mg of JOURNAVX orally every 12 hours.

**Dose reductions and warnings include:**

Patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) than those with normal hepatic function.

Dose reduction is recommended with Moderate CYP3A inhibitors.

**Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 include:**

clarithromycin

telithromycin

nefazodone

itraconazole

ketoconazole

atazanavir

darunavir

indinavir

lopinavir

nelfinavir

ritonavir

saquinavir

tipranavir

**Moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 include:**

amiodarone

erythromycin

fluconazole

miconazole

diltiazem

verapamil

delavirdine

amprenavir

fosamprenavir

conivaptan

**Fertility cautions:**

This medicine may temporarily reduce the chance of females becoming pregnant while taking this medicine.

Patients using contraceptives should continue to use contraceptives during treatment with Journavx.

Hormonal birth control (contraceptives) containing progestins other than levonorgestrel or norethindrone may not work as well while taking Journavx.

**Lactation:**

There are no data on the presence of Journavx or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production.

**Pediatric Use:**

The safety and effectiveness of JOURNAVX have not been established in pediatric patients.

**Metabolized:** Liver

**Active metabolite:** M6-SUZ, is 3.7 times less potent than Journavx as an inhibitor of NaV1.8.

**Excretion:**

Feces: 49.9% (9.1% SUZ and rest as metabolites)

Urine: 44.0% (primarily as metabolites)

**CYP3A vs CYP3A4**

The CYP3A subfamily represents the majority of CYP protein in the human liver and is involved in the metabolism of many drugs.

CYP3A4 is the major hepatic CYP3A enzyme and is also present in the intestinal epithelium.

CYP3A4 activity shows wide inter-individual variation of up to 40-fold.

CYP3A4 is a cytochrome P450 enzyme that is part of the CYP3A family of enzymes.

CYP3A4 is the primary enzyme responsible for metabolizing many drugs and other compounds in the liver and small intestine.

CYP3A4 function

Breaks down steroid hormones

-   Detoxifies bile acids
-   Eliminates phytochemicals in food and many medicines
-   Metabolizes drugs such as opioids, benzodiazepines, and immunosuppressants

CYP3A4 expression

-   CYP3A4 expression varies between individuals
-   CYP3A4 expression is higher in the small intestine than in other organs
-   CYP3A4 expression in the liver is lower in women than in men
-   CYP3A4 expression increases with age

CYP3A4 inhibition

-   CYP3A4 activity can be inhibited by grapefruit juice, ketoconazole, and cimetidine
-   CYP3A4 inhibition can impair the endocrine system and drug response
-   CYP3A4 induction can reduce the pain-alleviating effects of opioids
