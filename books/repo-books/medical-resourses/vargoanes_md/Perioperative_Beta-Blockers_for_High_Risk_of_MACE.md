Perioperative Beta-Blockers for High Risk of MACE    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Perioperative Beta-Blockers for High Risk of MACE

**MACE:** Major adverse cardiac events   
**RCRI:** Revised Cardiac Risk Index  
  
_Recommendations from the 2014 ACC/AHA Guideline on Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation and Management of Patients Undergoing Noncardiac Surgery.  
_**Recommendations for perioperative beta-blockers:**  
If stable, continue beta-blockers in patients who are on beta-blockers chronically.  
Guide management of beta-blockers after surgery by clinical circumstances.  
  
It may be reasonable to start beta-blockers before surgery in patients with intermediate-or high-risk-preoperative RCRI scores (≥ 3 RCRI factors)  
Refer to _“Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI)”_ within this app.  
  
Initiating beta-blockers in the perioperative setting as an approach to reduce perioperative risks is of uncertain benefit in those with long-term indications but no other RCRI risk factors.  
  
It may be reasonable to begin perioperative beta-blockers long enough in advance to assess safety and tolerability, preferably > 1 day before surgery.  
  
Beta-blocker therapy should not be started on the day of surgery, preferably before.
