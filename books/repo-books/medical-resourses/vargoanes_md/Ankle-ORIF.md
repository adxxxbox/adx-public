Ankle ORIF (Open Reduction Internal Fixation)     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### ORIF of the Ankle

Usually a simple case; it is the repair of an ankle fracture.  
  
Incision is on one or both sides of the ankle. Screws and/or a metal plate are inserted into the medial malleolus and the fibula in order to restore or reduce the fracture alignment.  
If the fracture is severe, an external fixator can be added in addition to a plate and screws.

**Anesthetic:** Usually General/LMA. If it is a recent trauma, the patient may have a full stomach and require intubation. If it is a regional, it will be a spinal, epidural or a femoral/sciatic nerve block.  
Remember, 10-15% of patients with bone fractures develop fat emboli. Watch for symptoms, especially post op.

A C-arm is used, so you will need a lead apron.

A splint is usually applied at the end of the case. So don’t wake the patient up too early until the splint is dry.
