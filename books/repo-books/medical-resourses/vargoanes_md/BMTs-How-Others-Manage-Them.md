## BMT – How Others Manage Them

**_How Anna Stone, CRNA, manages her BMTs_**  
These kids are usually snotty and may have a reactive airway. Never take your guard off any of these airways.

  
**So there are two ways I do these cases:**

My normal way:

**Mask induction** (if under 30kg) keep sevoflurane up until or apneic. This way you are positive they are deep enough so that the intranasal meds will not cause a laryngospasm. **Then give intranasal meds**  
Fentanyl 1mcg/kg (round up to nearest 5)  
Precedex 1mcg/kg.  
I will usually back off on giving the precedex to kids who are 5-6 years old. They usually don't have insanely crazy wake ups, unlike the toddlers and younger children.

**Don’t let the patient get light when masking**

These snotty airways are hyperactive and will spasm on you in a second. Your biggest fight against their little reactive airways is to provide some peep and some slight assistance while they are going through stage two anesthesia. If they do start to spasm, give more positive pressure and nerve pressure behind the ear (farther up from the jawline). This breaks MANY spasms for me to where I never see a desaturation or even have to give rescue meds.

**Precedex Note:** The key with using precedex is- know when to titrate your Sevoflurane. Once the surgeon is finishing up, turn the gas off and hyperventilate the patient to burn off the sevoflurane quicker.

If not, with the Sevoflurane combined with the precedex (both still circulating), will prolong your emergence.  
  
Most of my kids are awake and off to see their parents when I'm bringing my next patient to PACU. If they aren't awake, I go over and stimulate them and they wake right up.

**My Second way I do these cases:**

Intranasal Fentanyl 1mcg/kg  
IM Toradol 1mg/kg  
Tylenol suppository (15mg/kg) once patient is asleep.  
10mg/kg for less than 18 months.

Make sure to let parents know the next time they can give Tylenol and Ibuprofen.  
This avoids an overdose.

**Keys to remember:**  
DO NOT TRUST A SNOTTY airway! They will spasm on you in a second.

Most of the time these patients are sick due to chronic otitis media, which is why they are having the procedure. You cannot cancel the case every time they present with rhinorrhea because the procedure would never happen. That being said these patients will burn you with a laryngospasm so ALWAYS be prepared for that to happen. I always have succinylcholine , atropine, and propofol drawn up for these cases. I put an IM needle on the succinylcholine and atropine because I rarely start an IV on these patients (only if they have comorbidities that I’m concerned about such as Trisomy 21, Cardiac defects, etc).  
I always have an age appropriate ETT and laryngoscope at arms reach and an LMA in case I cannot get the patient intubated.

**Induction** : Mask General Anesthesia- Induce with 70% Nitrous Oxide and 30% Oxygen and Sevoflurane. It is imperative to maintain CPAP or PEEP on these kiddos to prevent a laryngospasm. I watch the suprasternal notch for retractions and titrate my pop off valve to ablate the retractions. Typically as soon as the HR starts to drop and I see the patient is moving from Stage II of anesthesia to Stage III of anesthesia, I will turn my Nitrous Oxide off and go to 100% Oxygen. I always try to keep the patient spontaneously breathing throughout the case, which frees up my right hand. Make sure the patient is deep enough because surgical stimulation can cause a laryngospasm. I typically place an oral airway as well because I want to optimize the patient’s airway so that when the patient’s head is turned I am not moving all around trying to keep the airway patent. I keep the patient on 100% oxygen for the case so that in case I have trouble ventilating at some point or have a laryngospasm I have a preoxygenated and build up a reserve, which permits me, more time to deal with the problem.

**Pain control:** I utilize intranasal Fentanyl at 2 mcg/kg. I usually do this between ears when I’m turning the head for the surgeon to ensure the patient has adequate depth of anesthesia on board and I am not causing a laryngospasm with putting liquid in the airway.  
**You can use:**  
Rectal Tylenol  
IM Toradol  
Intranasal precedex or midazolam.  
I have found the patients to wake up just fine with a 2 mcg/kg dose of intranasal fentanyl and that also keeps things simple.

**Emergence:** Typically, I take the patient to the PACU still deep with the oral airway in place. They wake up quickly and will be out of the PACU by the time I arrive with the next patient.

**Other important info:** The surgeons use ofloxacin eardrops. Many times they will expect you to hand these to them. I try to remember to take the cap off before we start the case because once you are holding the mask; you only have one free hand. Also, try to hold as still as possible when you are holding the mask. Remember, any movement that you make will look like an earthquake to the surgeon who is looking at this tiny ear canal under a microscope. It is especially important to be still while they have the knife in the ear. Watch your head when they are moving the microscope, they will hit you with it if you are not being vigilant and it does not feel good!

**Remember, it’s all about the laryngospasm and preventing it!!!!**

**_How Lauren Freedman CRNA manages her BMTs_**

**_I am a minimalist when it comes to BMTS,_**

I usually give 15mg/kg of Tylenol PO in the pre op area. (as long as it doesnt upset them)

These cases are done under pure mask. I have a syringe of Succinylcholine and Atropine and IM needles readily available. I start with Nitrous, then slowly add in Sevoflurane, if the patient is uncooperative, I go right to 8% Sevoflurane. I usually max out at 6% Sevoflurane with Downs patients in an effort to prevent Bradycardia. I mask manage these cases (determining the need for an oral airway once deep enough) many of these kids also have tonsillar hypertrophy and an oral airway can ease the masking process.

Once the patient is deep enough, I turn the head to one side, the ultimate goal is to keep the patient spontaneously breathing throughout. Once I know they are deep enough, I turn off the Nitrous. Once they tolerate the first ear, I then drop the Sevo to 4-6% for the second ear, once the ear is done, transport deep to the PACU with emergency meds and bag mask device.

Every once in a while we get a very obese child that is greater than 10 years old. If there is any question that masking will not be enough or there is a concern with the airway and the potential for obstruction we will insert an IV.

**_How Dina Velocci, CRNA, Manages her BMTs_**

**First rule :** Treat all airways like they will spasm. Always keep a little positive pressure (dial on 5) tension on the green bag.

All kids get Tylenol 20-30 mg/kg suppository and intranasal Fentanyl 1mcg/kg.

Inhalation induction with SEVO/N2O (only time I drop the N2O is if the child has pulmonary or cardiac issues)

I take over respirations get the child deep. I always maintain positive pressure in the circuit (peep). The reason is to help prevent spasm of the airway.

I run Sevoflurane / N20 the whole case (N20 50/50).

I administer the meds stated above.

As the surgeon does his/her thing, I keep a constant pressure on the bag and let them come back breathing. I dial back the Sevoflurane as we start the second ear to 1. At the end the patient is breathing and I shut off both the Sevoflurane/N2O and increase the O2.

I always keep positive pressure on the bag. This wards off the spams. If the little bugger begins to spasm don’t panic. Dial more positive pressure and apply pressure behind the jaw. I call this the Chicken game. I never stop. Despite the Sao2 dropping, do not stop holding positive pressure and jaw lift. They will break. You can always ask the circulator to administer your prepared Succinylcholine 5mg (0.25cc) IM if things go really south.

How JoVanna Eisenbarth CRNA, Manages Her BMTs  
_**BMT’s are like reverse “touch and goes” to borrow the aircraft take off and landing theme: Get them up--deep on the anesthetic, and bring them back down. There’s normally not a lot of flight time or maintenance anesthesia involved. Most of the BMT kiddos you see will be young, usually <5 years old, and they will have active or recent URI’s—That’s why they’re here. Vigilance in your set up, to have a couple back up plans for when things don’t go perfectly, is key—having extra Airway alternatives, ETT’s, LMA’s, Oral Airways in assorted flavors, and emergency/rescue medications, succs, propofol, lidocaine, and atropine—it’s not just a security blanket, it could save a life.

When you know you have several BMT cases, be sure to prep airway trays for the ages/sizes on the schedule, have emergency drugs within arms reach at all times, and prep enough shoulder rolls to allow for some incorrect sizing, and some lost to the floor in the heat of a mask induction.

These patients standardly receive a little versed pre-op, but still may not be relaxed when they come to you—as appropriate for their age group. I normally mask induce with a pulse ox only, and the rest of the monitors get added during the induction by the OR nurse. 70/30 N20/O2 to start and then I creep up the Sevo after a few breaths, unless the kiddo is a screaming banshee (inconsolable) on arrival to the OR in which case I crank up the Sevo with the N2O/O2 from the start. Be ready for the inhalation induction rodeo (those who have not experienced it will only understand the concept once they have) and be sure to keep a little peep on board with your good mask seal. DO NOT TAKE OVER BREATHING.

Once the pt begins to relax and the VS return closer to baseline (usually around an ET Sevo of 5%), I turn off my N20, and slowly bring my Sevo back to ~1.5 MAC, IM or infranasal Fentanyl can now be administered, and consider a rectal Tylenol. Pay special attention to the quality of respirations during this time period as you position the patient for surgery, if there are retractions or some obstruction, try adding more peep, make sure your shoulder roll is appropriately located to help open the airway, and consider an oral airway. I try to avoid them, but when I feel they are necessary, I don’t hesitate to use one. Just be sure to size appropriately. Maintain the patient’s spontaneous ventilation throughout.

Once the surgeon has moved to the second side and begins working, I begin titrating my gas down (of course providing for the speed of the surgeon). I normally position the pt on their Left lateral side for transport to PACU, using the mask to help position the airway. If the child is too large for me to reposition by myself should an emergency arise, then I leave them supine for transport.

The caveat to the above is the outside the mold kiddo, ie someone with comorbidities, personal or familial history of anesthesia problems, or current severe URI. These kiddos standardly get an IV after mask induction and may receive other medications, airway interventions, or after care as necessary.

**_How Brian Del Grosso CRNA Does his BMTs_**

Given the nature of the speed of this case, we generally mask these patients. These patients are at a higher risk of laryngospasms so we always have emergency airway equipment readily available (ETT in multiple sizes as well as LMAs). We generally try to obtain an IV during the induction phase if we have time in order to serve as back up for emergency and pain management, however, we do not hold up the surgeon from starting the case. All patients get standard induction with 30/70 O2/N20 with 8% Sevoflurane. Once patient is deep enough an oral airway is inserted to make masking the patient easier. Once an adequate level of anesthetic has been obtained the N20 is shut off and the Sevoflurane is backed off slightly to prevent any bradycardia. The goal is to keep the patient spontaneously breathing with minimal assistance from the bag. If an IV doesn’t look like an easy task we will use intranasal fentanyl (1-2mcq/kg). Note: Patients with genetic abnormalities such as CP, Tri-21 and Congenital Cardiac Disease we generally will place an LMA or ETT plus an IV secondary to extrinsic variables these cases may present to the team.

These cases are extremely fast. Once the airway has been established the N20 is shut off in order to allow for maximum FRC. When the surgeon is done with the first ear and the head is turned to the second side, we generally back off the Sevoflurane and allow for the child to start building up CO2 to increase better spontaneous breathing. Once the myringotomy is done and the ear tube is about to be placed, the anesthetic is shut off and the oxygen flows are increased.

There are numerous ways to perform these procedures and each child should be evaluated on a needs basis. Always have emergency drugs readily available and on IM needles. Most of the time you will be masking the case and will only have one had free so position your machine and equipment all within reach.

**_How Christine Cawler CRNA manages her BMTs  
_**I like intranasal meds, but we do not use them at the surgery center where I. We administer rectal or PO Tylenol.

A "pearl" I would add is that I never let them go apneic. It's hard to kill a spontaneously breathing child!!! And I almost always use an oral airway, especially as you're turning the head back and forth.

Also, there are a few doctors that DO NOT like Nitrous, because it will "puff out" the eardrum.
