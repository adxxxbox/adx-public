### En Bloc Resection

A surgical procedure that attempts to remove the whole tumor in a single piece, intact, encased by a continuous cuff of healthy (tumor-free) tissue. Back tumors are usually very vascular.

**What if the spinal column is damaged?**  
Many tumors in the spine will affect the bone of the vertebral body, causing it to weaken, and occasionally collapse.  This is known as a crush fracture. This usually requires a fusion.

**Anesthetic:** General /ETT  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Usually, just check with the surgeon.

**Duration:** 2-5 hours.  
**EBL:** Usually a lot, cell savers are commonly used for these procedures.  
**IV Access:** 1 or 2 18G.  Make sure the IV sites are not an AC site. They may kink or not run when the arms are flexed 90 degrees whole prone.  
**A-line:** Usually, depending on EBL. Check with the surgeon.

**Antibiotics:** Usually Ancef, unless contraindicated.  
**Neuro Monitoring:** Depends on the location and surgeon preference.  
**Position:** Most are prone. Arms in pronated in the flying superman position. You need to maintain cervical neutrality during positioning.

  
Eyes, ears, and nose should be checked to assure that these areas are free from pressure. 

Make sure the chest rolls are in proper place and the shoulders are padded.

**Possible Complications:**

Hardware failures.  
Wound dehiscence.  
Hematomas  
Hemorrhage  
Aortic dissection.  
Neurological Myelopathy.
