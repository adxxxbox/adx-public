### Epinephrine Concentration Notes

Epinephrine is commercially available in two ampule sizes:  
A 1 ml ampule containing 1 mg (i.e. 1:1000)  
A 10 ml ampule containing 1 mg (i.e. 1:10,000)  
  
It is important to understand exactly what these figures mean. Novice practitioners are often confused by this subject. A 1% solution of any drug contains 1 gram (i.e. 1000 mg) of drug per 100 ml of solution.  
Therefore, a 1% lidocaine solution contains 1000 mg of lidocaine per 100 ml (which is the same as 10 mg/ml)**  
  
Remember: “1:1,000 Epinephrine contains 1 mg/ml”  
  
Distinguishing between fractions and percentage:  
**A 1% concentration of a local anesthetic contains 10mg per ml.

Distinguishing between fractions and percentage  
  
****Epinephrine concentration is measured differently**  
1mg ampule of 1:1000 epinephrine means that the solution contains 1mg of epinephrine per ml.  
EPINEPHRINE 1:1000 = 1mg/mL  
  
If 1:1,000 of Epi = 1mg/mL, then 1:10,000 solution of Epi = 0.1mg/mL (or 100mcg/mL)  
1:100,000 solution = 10 mcg/mL  
**1:200,000 solution = 5mcg/mL- Common in regional anesthesia**  
1:400,000 solution = 2.5 mcg/mL  
  
**Practice examples:**  
**Example 1**  
How do you make up 25 ml of 2% lidocaine with 1:250,000 epinephrine?  
**Answer:**  
Take an ampule of 1:1000 epinephrine (1 mg/ml)  
Add 10 ml of saline to give 1:10,000 (100 micrograms per ml).  
Then add 1 ml of this epinephrine solution to 25 ml of 2% plain lidocaine (100 micrograms per 25 ml = 4 micrograms per ml).  
This is not exactly correct but near enough.  
  
**Example 2  
**How do you prepare a 1:200,000 solution of epinephrine in 1% lidocaine?**  
Answer:**Take 0.1ml (100mcg) of epinephrine from a 1:1000 ampule and add it to 19.9 ml of 1% plain lidocaine.  
  
**Where you should avoid epinephrine injections**  
Epinephrine-containing solutions should NOT be used in parts of the body which are supplied by end arteries (fingers, toes, penis, nose, ears).  
  
The maximum safe dose of epinephrine is controversial.  
There is NO good reason to use concentrations in excess of 1:200,000 in the skin.  
1:400,000 is quite adequate in most cases.  
  
Use 1:200,000 for peripheral nerves.  
  
Adopt the habit of never using a concentration greater than 1:200,000 (5 micrograms/ml).  
  
Dentists prefer 1:80,000 but the volumes used are low.  
  
MAXIMUM SAFE DOSE OF EPINEPHRINE = 4 mcg PER KG.
