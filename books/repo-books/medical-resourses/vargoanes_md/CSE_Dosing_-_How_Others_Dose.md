### CSE - How Others Dose

  
CSE:(Combined Spinal Epidural)  
As noted in the "Combined Spinal Epidural Dosing Review" file, a study showed that  
_"the optimum dose of intrathecal fentanyl/bupivacaine to yield the best efficacy to side effect ratio is:_ 2.5mg of 0.75% (0.33 mL) Bupivacaine and 10-15mcg of fentanyl."  
Spinal doses with CSEs for LABOR (not C-sections) vary between experienced anesthesia providers. Below doses is from a survey from experienced CRNAs.

**_Lisa Steih Moreno, CRNA  
_****Spinal**: 0.6 mL of 0.75% Marcaine with or without 25mcg of Fentanyl  
**Epidural PCEA**: 5 mL/hr of 0.2% Ropivacaine

**_Chuck Frisch DNP, CRNA, Director of Anesthesia at Box Butte General Hospital, Alliance, Nebraska_****Spinal Dose:** 25 mcg fentanyl intrathecal.  
**Epidural PCEA**: Then start 0.2% Ropivacaine with 2.5 mcg fentanyl/cc at 5 cc/hr with bolus of 5 cc every 10 minutes up to 4 cc an hour.

**_Sara Fredriksson (Figueroa) CRNA, University of Colorado Health Science Center_**  
**Spinal Dose:** 0.5 cc of Bupivacaine and 25mcg Fentanyl  
**Epidural PCEA**: 0.08% Bupivicaine with fentanyl 2mcg/cc infusion at 10cc/hr and a 5cc bolus with 10 minute lockout.

**_Lincon Shao, CRNA, Coppell, Texas_**  
**Spinal Dose:** I but don't inject anything into the spinal. I heard in a lecture that creating little hole in the dura can make your epidural more dense and effective.  
**Epidural Loading Dose:** varies - based on their labor stage, but I give larger volume.  
**Epidural PCEA**: 0.2% Ropivacaine with 2 mcg/ml of Fentanyl at 10ml/hr.  
Top off dose is the same-mix usually 6-8 ml.

**_Matt Moren, CRNA_**  
I only give 1.5mL of 1% Lidocaine just to get them comfortable. I then bolus their epidural with 10mL from the drip bag. Our drip bags are: 0.125% Bupivacaine and 2mcg of Fentanyl per cc. Start the drip right after-usually at 12mL/hr. Some of my colleagues use 1-1.5 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine and their patients tend to experience more of a BP drop.

_**Bob Shaw, CRNA**_  
10-20mcg of Fentanyl, then test dose the epidural catheter and start the PCEA pump containing 0.125% Marcaine with 2mcg of Fentanyl/cc.

**_Alex Maynard, CRNA_**  
7.5mcg of Sufenta and 0.3mg of Duramorph  
Then epidural bolus with 5cc of 0.25% Bupivacaine and start the PCEA pump.  
**Just Spinal Doses of CSE (epidural doses not included)**

**_Jim Carroll comments for below:_** _Especially where 0.75% bupivacaine is being discussed, there is no indication whether this is plain (no dextrose) or hyperbaric (with D8.25W). Anecdotally, we've seen better efficacy and a lower incidence of fetal bradycardia following maternal pain relief with 0.75% plain bupivacaine. The label, of course, says "not for obstetric use" so it's off-label but safe. The doses cited by the providers surveyed all appear reasonable to me; at any rate, they should be safe._

**_Jack Fowler, CRNA_**  
6 mg of 0.75% Marcaine and 25 mcg of fentanyl.  
All of a sudden they're smiling. Like Jekyll and Hyde.

**_Grant Carruthers, CRNA_**  
Precipitous Primipara: 0.5cc of 0.75% Bupivacaine with 25 mcg fentanyl.  
For normal precipitous labor: 1mL 0.25%  
Unless they are 9-10cm dilated and multiparous, I will start a PCEA pump.

**_Cathy Devito, CRNA_**  
15 mcg fentanyl and 1 mg 0.25% (0.4mL) Bupivicaine at any cm dilation.  
No loading and I just I hook up to PCEA pump unless they are multiparous at 10 cm and advancing fast.

_**William Alan Hathorn, CRNA**_   
0.5cc of 0.75% Bupivacaine

**_Jose Ortiz, CRNA_**  
25 mcg Fentanyl and 2.5 mg of 0.5% bupivacaine followed by a PCEA.

**_Joshua Kemper,_ CRNA**  
1mL 0.25% PF bupivacaine for normal and precipitous labor.  
I connect to PCEA unless they are 9-10cm and multiparous.  
Even a complete nulliparous mom can labor down for another hour or more.

**_Jennifer Smith, Sealman, CRNA_**  
1mL of 0.25% Bupivacaine + 0.5 mL of Fentanyl

**_Blake Stevens, CRNA_**  
20mcg of Fentanyl and nothing else

**_Lori Talley Self, CRNA_  
**1 mL of 0.25% Marcaine.  
I've done the straight fentanyl but my patients have had serious itching. So I don't do that anymore.

**_Michael Frank, CRNA_**  
2.5mg of either 0.25% or 0.5% Marcaine and NO fentanyl

**_Maritza Gallegos-Mohmood, CRNA_  
**1mL of 0.25% Marcaine and 10mcg of fentanyl

**_Rose Woods, CRNA_  
**0.5mL of 0.75% bupivacaine and 0.5mL of fentanyl

**_Jami Baisden, CRNA_  
**0.5mL of 0.25% Marcaine and 5-10mcf of Sufenta

**_Kyle Nevills, CRNA_

**_Josh Becker, CRNA_  
**0.5mL (3.75mg) of 0.75% Marcaine and 25mcg of Fentanyl

**_Ray Alonge, CRNA_**  
25mcg of Fentanyl in 2mL of PF saline.

**_Jeff Hansen_  
**1cc of 0.25% Marcaine and 10mcg of Sufenta

**_Michael Hunt, CRNA_  
**12.5-25mcg of Fentanyl or 1mL of Bupivacaine. Then I thread the catheter and test dose with 3 mLs and start the PCEA pump.

**_T.J Rubalcava, CRNA_  
**0.4cc of 0.75% Bupivacaine (3mg) and 0.4cc of Fentanyl (20mcg) and 0.15mg of Duramorph all mixed in 2cc PF saline.

**_Ira Saunders, CRNA_
