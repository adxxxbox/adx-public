### Exploratory Laparoscopy  
(Also see Laparoscopy)

Basically, the surgeon is just looking around intra-abdominally with a laparoscope. Instead of making a large incision like the olden days, much smaller incisions are made. This makes a quicker recovery time. The surgeon will usually take pictures with the laparoscope camera.

Laparoscopy is a relatively recent alternative to an open laparotomy that has many advantages.  
  
Also called minimally invasive surgery, laparoscopy is a surgical procedure in which a laparoscope and other instruments are inserted into the abdomen through small incisions.  
  
Just like any other laparoscopy, the internal operating field is visualized on a video monitor.  
  
In some patients, the technique may be used for abdominal exploration in place of a laparotomy. Laparoscopy is associated with faster recovery times, shorter hospital stays, and smaller surgical scars.

**Anesthesia:** General/ETT  
Be careful with your muscle relaxants. Some surgeons are extremely fast and can finish before your relaxant wears off.  
**Duration:** Depends on whet the surgeon finds. If nothing is found, it may be less than 20 minutes. If something is found that needs surgically corrected, it will take longer, or even converted to an open procedure.  
**IV Access:** 20G is usually acceptable.  
**EBL:** minimal  
**Position:** Supine with one or both arms out.
