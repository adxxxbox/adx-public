### LMA Supreme®

The LMA Supreme is a **second-generation supraglottic airway that** was introduced in 2007.  
It has a “Second Seal” near the tip.  
It has a gastric port for gastric tube insertion.  
The importance of the Second Seal (esophageal seal) is significant as it can minimize gastric insufflation and reduce the risk of aspiration.
