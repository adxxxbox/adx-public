### Fentanyl (Sublimaze) Adjuvant to Neuraxial Anesthesia

Fentanyl is a highly potent, lipophilic, phenylpiperidine derivative.  
Fentanyl is 100 times more potent and 800 times more lipid soluble than Morphine.  
Sufenta and Fentanyl both have a high lipid solubility and a low pKa, resulting in an extremely potent analgesic effect, rapid onset, and short duration of action. However, opioids with diminished lipophilicity (morphine) have a slow onset and prolonged analgesia.  
  
Fentanyl=Fast onset, short duration and early respiratory depression (very rare at recommended doses).  
  
**Fentanyl Neuraxial Doses  
Intrathecal  
Onset:** 5 minutes  
**Duration of Action:** 2-4 hours  
**Doses:** 2.5-60mcg (PONV and pruritus is significantly reduced with doses < 35mcg)**Popular dose range:** 10-20 mcg  
**  
Epidural**  
**Onset:** 10-30 minutes (literature varies)  
**Duration of Action:** 2-5 hours (literature varies)**Adjuvant to local Anesthetic with loading dose:** 100mcg is common  
  
**Common mixture in Local Anesthetic Bag (continuous infusion)  
**Almost always 2mcg/cc in your bag  
Continuous infusion at 10 mLs per hour, that is equivalent of receiving less than 25mcg (1/2 mL). Opioids with high lipid solubility and low pKa result in an extremely potent analgesic effect, with rapid onset and short duration of action.  
However, opioids with diminished lipophilicity, such as morphine, have a slow onset and prolonged analgesia  
  
**Method of Action  
Intrathecal (Spinal) Opioids  
Can bind to opioid receptors in three different areas to produce analgesia  
**1) Substantia Gelatinosa (Rexed’s lamina II) in the Dorsal Horn - have direct access and it is the  
main site of action. The release of substance P is reduced and the transmission of impulses through the Substantia Gelatinosa is inhibited.  
2) They are also transported supra-spinally by CSF flow where they modulate descending  
inhibitory pain pathways.  
3) A small amount of drug penetrates the dura mater into the epidural cavity. This allows the drug to reach the venous plexus of Baston, enter the systemic circulation, and resultsing in  
centrally-mediated analgesia (minor effect).  
  
**Time of Possible Respiratory Depression:** within 2 hours.  
Fentanyl immediately penetrates the spinal cord and is absorbed systemically by neighboring blood vessels, so symptoms will show up much quicker.  
_(Morphine is much less lipid soluble and hangs out in the CSF longer allowing it to move cephalad and possibly enter the brainstem causing a delayed respiratory depression.)_  
**Post-Op Analgesia for C-sections:** limited due to short duration. That is why we also give morphine.  
  
**Active Metabolites:** None  
**Metabolites:** norfentanyl and despropionylfentanyl  
**Metabolized By:** cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme  
**Elimination:** 75% of the dose is excreted in urine mostly as metabolites  
with less than 10% representing unchanged drug  
Unchanged fentanyl is detectable in urine immediately postoperatively and sometimes at 24 hours.  
**72 hours:** Usually undetectable.  
**Norfentanyl metabolite:** Present in larger quantities than fentanyl immediately postoperatively.  
**96 hours:** Detectable in around 50% of patients..  
**Despropionylfentanyl metabolite:** Not detected in any of the urine specimens tested.  
**Saliva:** Not detectable  
  
**Pharmacokinetics of Fentanyl  
pKa:** 8.4  
Fentanyl is a weak base and at physiological pH only about 10% of molecules are unionized.  
**Remember --** **the more nonionized, the faster the onset.**  
**Unionized at 7.4 (%):** 90  
**Plasma Protein bound (%):** 84  
**Terminal Half Life:** 3.5 hours  
**Clearance (mL/min/kg):** 0.8-1.0  
**Vol of Distribution (L/kg):** 3-5  
**Relative Lipid Solubility:** 580-very high  
(morphine =1) and (alfenta= 90)  
  
**Side Effects  
****Urinary Retention (opioids)  
**Urinary retention is a problem mainly with hydrophilic spinal opioids (morphine) and has not been observed with lipophilic opioids. However, some literature blames all narcotics.  
  
**Local Anesthetics and Urinary Retention**  
Most of the urinary retention is caused by local anesthetics. The bladder is innervated from S3, S4 and S5.  
  
**Remember:** The later stages of labor, we administer “top off” doses to reach S2-S4 in order to help with perineal pain. Part of the bladder is innervated by S3 and S4. Even with just sensory (not motor) block, the patient loses the urge to micturate.  
This is why the patient’s foley remains.**Pruritus and Fentanyl  
**Pregnant women are more susceptible to pruritus after neuraxial opioid administration than other populations, with incidence of 60-100%Pruritus is the most common side effect. Nausea and vomiting are rare.  
Opioids can also induce itching at the spinal level by “itch-selective” secondary neurons in the lamina I spinothalamic tract of the dorsal horn.  
The mu receptor is also responsible for some side effects, especially pruritus and nausea or vomiting.  
  
**PONV  
**The less narcotics given, usually the less PONV.
