### Warfarin - Severe Bleed Reversal

**Many methods to reverse the anti-vitamin K effect.  
  
_Note: Kcentra,_** _a 4F-PCC containing coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as antithrombotic proteins C and S, is designed to selectively restore the pro-coagulant and antithrombotic protein deficiencies induced by VKAs._  
  
**Urgent surgery:** PCC (prothrombin complex concentrates)  
Vitamin K1 is usually administered with PCC, depends on the VKA (vitamin K antagonist) half-life.  
  
**Severe bleed**  
Vitamin K 10 mg IV + KCentra (4‐factor PCC) or 4 units of FFP.  
**INR ≤ 6.0 or unknown:** KCentra 35 units/kg x 1 (Max 3500 units).  
**INR > 6.0:** KCentra 50 units/kg x 1 (Max 5,000 units).  
  
Recheck INR 10‐30 minutes after 4‐factor PCC administration.  
Due to short half‐life of PCC, check INR Q 6hrs for 24 hours.  
  
**KCentra:** (4-factor PCC) 50 units/kg x1 at 3 units/kg/min (max dose 5000 units).  
KCentra is current formulary prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) product.  
Contains clotting factors II, VII, IX and X. It contains heparin and use should be avoided in patients where heparin is contraindicated.**_PCC Warning:_** _Thrombotic and thromboembolic events including DIC, venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction and stroke have been reported after the administration of high doses. Patients must be monitored following administration._
