Bronchospasm    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

## Bronchospasm - Perioperative

**Treatment for Acute Bronchospams Preoperatively**  
Supplemental O2-usually NC  
Aerosol Treatment with unit dose Proventil (Ventolin) or  
(Metered Dose Inhaler) MDI Proventil (Ventolin)  
Aerosol treatments appear more efficacious than MDIs despite some literature.  
Another bronchodilator sometimes used is **Ipratropium Bromide (Atrovent)**

**Treatment for Intraoperative Mild Bronchospasm – LMA or ETT  
**While you initiate treatment, try and find the cause.Did the patient aspirate? Anaphylaxis? Too light? Secretions?  
(Suspect anaphylaxis with hypotension and/or rash/hives)  
Increase oxygen concentration to 100% (optional)  
Increase or switch to Sevoflurane  
Several puffs of Proventil MDI via inspiratory limb  
Consider up to 30mg/kg x 1 of Solu-Medrol if no response to above treatments  
Gently pass a suction catheter through the LMA or ETT and oropharynx to check for secretions.  
For suspicion of aspiration, pursue aspiration protocol and call for anesthesia help  
If accompanied by hypotension, consider anaphylaxis protocol and call for anesthesia help

**Severe Bronchospasms with LMA/ETT (↑ETCO2, ↓SaO2 and ↑PIP alarm)  
**Call for anesthesia help  
(Suspect anaphylaxis with hypotension and/or rash/hives)  
Increase to 100% O2  
Maximize your Sevoflurane (inhalation agents are bronchodilators)  
Discontinue machine ventilation and manually ventilate  
If LMA, consider for possible laryngospasm or aspiration  
Consider a Propofol bolus  
Consider up to 30mg/kg x 1 of Solu-Medrol if no response to above treatments  
Several puffs of Proventil MDI via inspiratory limb  
Pass a suction catheter  
If no improvement with the above, pull the LMA and intubate

**When bronchial constriction worsens-still in the operating room  
Consider the following IV bronchodilators:**  
**Ephedrine** - 25mg (if not contraindicated)  
**Epinephrine** - 0.1- 0.5 mL of 1:1000 of Epinephrine (if not contraindicated)  
**Isuprel** – 0.01-0.02mg (Dilute 1mL (0.2mg) to 10mL of NS.  
Bolus: Bolus initial dose (if not contraindicated)  
May repeat  
**Ketamine:** 20-50mg, Ketamine is the only IV anesthetic bronchodilator  
  
**If you all of the sudden you can’t ventilate via ETT consider:**  
Misplaced/kinked/blocked ETT or circuit  
Pneumothorax?  
Anaphylaxis?  
Pulmonary Edema?  
Possible obstruction distal ETT?  
Severe Bronchospasm  
Call for Anesthesia Help

Pass a suction catheter and it could tell you a lot.  
ETT easily kinks when the patient is in a position of chin to chest  
Start Severe Bronchospasm Algorithm

**More Notes**  
**Results of a study – puts things into prospective**

One study showed that with the onset of relevant bronchospasms:

21% were from anaphylaxis.  
Of the other remaining cases of bronchospasm:  
  44% occurred at induction and of these:  
      64% were from airway irritation (maybe not deep enough).  
      17% were from ETT misplacement.  
      11% were due to aspiration.  
      8% from other causes.  
  36% occurred during anesthesia maintenance and of these:  
      31% were due to ETT problem.  
      14% were due to aspiration with an LMA.  
  20% occurred during emergence and recovery room and of these:  
      38% had no specific cause identified.  
      25% were due to pulmonary edema.  
      18% were due to aspiration.  
  55% of cases of bronchospasms at induction were idiopathic or presumed to be from airway irritation from laryngoscopy and/or intubation.  
  12% were associated with esophageal intubation and 2.5% with endobronchial intubation.  
  12% of cases were associated with aspiration.

**Possible symptoms of bronchospasm during anesthesia**  
Expiratory wheeze  
Audible wheeze  
Prolonged expiration  
Slowly increasing wave on the capnograph  
Elevated peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) - if on the ventilator  
Decreased SaO2  
Difficult to manually ventilate  
Decreased exhaled tidal volumes  

**Possible Severe Bronchospasm Symptoms**  
Silent breath sounds with or without auscultation  
High PIP with little to no exhaled tidal volume  
Unable to manually ventilate  
Decreased SaO2  
_Bronchospasms just don’t happen, they are caused_.  
  
**Possible causes of bronchospasm during anesthesia**  
Noxious stimuli - cold air  
Inhaled irritants (Desflurane)  
Aspiration - mild or severe  
Physical irritation: Movement of ETT, tracheal intubation or surgical procedure involving the airway.  
Anaphylaxis reaction  
Pneumothorax  
Endobronchial intubation  
Airway manipulation/irritation/secretions  
  
Whenever you have a patient with asthma, always keep your guard up, especially with pediatrics.  
  
**Reactive Airway Disease (RAD)** is a term slowly replacing asthma or any patient with hypersensitive airways. COPD in general.

**Pre-op- Patients with known RAD  
**Does your patient take Aerosol (nebulizer) treatments or MDIs at home?  
If they do, when was their last dose? Many patients do not take their morning meds.  
  
Consider an inhaler or aerosol treatment preoperatively.  
How do their lungs sound with your preoperative assessment?  
  
**Tips to help prevent Bronchospasms with RAD patients during surgery  
**4 puffs of Proventil in the room prior to induction  
Keep the patient deep during anesthesia-if the patient becomes light and starts coughing, the onset of bronchospasm may follow.  
Sevoflurane is the gas of choice  
Isoflurane and the 2nd inhalation agent of choice  
Avoid Desflurane-it is very pungent and can cause a bronchospasm with RAD patients.  
Do not manipulate the ETT once it is secured  
Use an LTA kit with intubation (many hospitals stop stocking them)  
For patients in Trendelenburg, consider an OG Tube  
  
Proventil nebulizer standard dose: 0.5 mL of 0.5% solution (2.5 mg) over 5-15 min q4-8hr PRN; not to exceed 10 mg/24hr. 3cc of NS is added to the Proventil in the nebulizer  
  
MDI: 180 mcg (2 puffs) inhaled PO q4-6hr; not to exceed 12 inhalations/24 hr.  
  
If you cannot remember the dose, you can just tell the respiratory therapist to administer the “Unit Dose” of Proventil.  
  
Never proceed to the operating room with an uncontrolled wheezing airway.

Anaphylaxis is rare, but you need to always rule it out.

  
**Possible symptoms of Anaphylaxis  
**Rash and/ or hives on the surface of the skin  
Onset of wheezing  
Hypotension-could be severe  
Cardiac arrest  
Bradycardia  
The eyes, lips, hands, feet, and other areas of the face and body may swell up rapidly.  
  
**Differential Diagnosis  
**Bronchus intubation  
Pulmonary edema  
ARDS
