### Indocyanine Green (ICG) (IC-GREEN™)

ICG is an IV administered dye used to evaluate real time tissue or organ perfusion (Indocyanine Green Angiography) during surgical procedures.  
ICG is a water soluble, tricarbocyanine dye.  
ICGA - (Indocyanine Green Angiography)  
  
**Each vial of ICG contains:** 25mg of a sterile lyophilized powder. You will mix it with 5cc of sterile water, which yields 5mg/cc.  
  
**How to Administer:** ICG is given as an IV bolus and immediately flushed with a 10ml saline bolus. Imaging is done during the few minutes after injection. Normally a new bolus can be given after about 15 minutes. Some studies may be performed every 8 to 10 minutes.  
  
After the ICG has been administered, the operating room is darkened by turning out all the lights. The contrast dye requires an acquisition time of 60 seconds. Eight to ten seconds after delivery of the dye into the patient's circulation, a fluorescence angiography is imaged over the desired tissue or organ to determine what tissue is and is not being perfused. The basic images produced look similar to night vision images, with well-perfused areas appearing white and non-perfused areas appearing black. Once generated, the images can be digitally processed into color intensity maps that may be further analyzed to create contour maps of perfusion ranges within the zones of a flap.  
  
**When it is to be given:** Exactly when the surgeon tells you to! Don't anticipate - This injection must be very carefully timed and prepared.  
  
**Dosing:** The literature varies, but the gist is that you should never administer a total >25mg/kg. One source even stated that the total dose of dye injected should be kept below 2mg/kg. But with a surgical procedure that may involve multiple injections, each dose should not exceed 1mg/kg. Most surgeons request only 10-15mg x 1.  
  
**For studies of hepatic function:** 0.5 mg/kg IV.  
  
**Cardiac output and blood volume monitoring:** the total dose should be kept below 2 mg/kg.  
  
**Overdose**: There is no data available describing the signs, symptoms, or laboratory findings accompanying overdosage.  
  
**The Ld50 after I.V. administration ranges are listed below:**  
60-80 mg/kg in mice.  
50-70 mg/kg in rats.  
50-80 mg/kg in rabbits.  
Only three deaths have ever been reported due to ICG adverse reactions.  
  
**Method of action:**  
The ICG binds tightly to plasma proteins like albumin and becomes confined to the vascular system.  
  
**Half-life:** 150 to 180 seconds.  
**Metabolized:** Hepatic.  
**Metabolites:** None active.  
**Excreted:** Renal.  
Percentage disappearance rate in healthy subjects is 18-24% per minute.  
  
**Normal biological half-time:** 2.5-3.0 minutes.  
The plasma fractional disappearance rate at the recommended 0.5mg/kg dose has been reported to be significantly greater in women than in men.  
  
**Toxicity:** Low  
  
**Contraindications:**  
Use with caution in patients who are allergic to iodine or shellfish.  
However, anaphylactic or urticarial reactions have been reported in patients both with and without a history of allergy to iodides.  
Patients with liver disease and those undergoing hemodialysis for chronic renal failure may be at an increased risk of experiencing adverse side effects.  
  
**pH:** 6.5 when reconstituted.  
**Pregnancy and lactation:**  
**Category:** C; Caution while nursing.  
ICG has not been proven to be teratogenic.  
  
**Side Effects:**  
The main side effect of ICG is the discoloration of stools for several days.  
  
**Adverse Reactions:**  
Mild: Nausea and vomiting.  
Infiltration: Tissue necrosis is rare.  
Drug Interactions: Heparin preparations containing sodium bisulfite reduce the absorption peak of Indocyanine Green in blood and, therefore, should not be used as an anticoagulant for the collection of samples for analysis.  
  
**More Notes and Uses: (Many are not utilized in the US yet)**  

**Reconstructive Microsurgery:** Perfusion can be assessed for plastic surgery.  
  
In Perforator flap reconstructions, ICG flow studies are able to detect suitable perforator vessels. The quality of these vessels facilitates the design of the flap. Flaps that are over 15×30cm in size can be raised on a single perforating artery and its concomitant vein.  
In breast reconstructions, transverse abdominal flaps can be raised on superficial vessels alone. This is called a SIEA-flap. More commonly, surgeons will be using the deep inferior epigastric perforator flap, aka a DIEP flap.  
  
**Neurosurgery Vascular Operations:**  
ICG may exclude vascular malformations, or AVMs. It can be helpful in the identification and differentiation of cerebral feeding arteries, arterialized draining veins, and normal veins, as well as the fistulous sites, all done intraoperatively. Also it can be utilized for assessing the patency of microanastomoses during an extracranial-intracranial revascularization bypass operation.  
ICG is helpful in identifying the target recipient artery of sufficient diameter (>1mm) in extracranial-intracranial bypass procedures performed during very small (3cm) craniotomies.  
ICG is invaluable in evaluating the patency of the extracranial vertebral artery after surgical transposition; and in localizing the vertebral artery within its periosteal sheath during a surgery for cervical neurinomas.  
In some neuro centers, usiog ICG has become a routine method for intraoperative evaluation of intracranial blood circulation.  
  
**CABG:** There is up to a 5% intraoperative graft occlusion in CABG surgeries.  
So an ICG Angiogram can be used intraoperatively while the chest is still open to assess the graft patency. A newly sutured graft occlusion can be immediately recognized and dealt with, possibly necessitating graft revision. On the table the first time is always better than a bringback later on that night. It is sometimes used for cardiac output monitoring.  
  
**Vascular:** ICG is sometimes used for:  
Assessment of graft patency.  
Diagnostics of peripheral arterial occlusive disease and Raynaud Phenomenon (RP).  
Predicting wound healing after a major amputation.  
To evaluate splanchnic circulation.  
  
**Lymphoscintigram, and Sentinel Lymph Node Harvesting:** Currently when doing a Lymphoscintigram, radioactive technetium-99m isotope labeling is used to detect lymph nodes. This may be replaced by ICG NIR imaging. ICG is injected under the skin from where it flows via lymph circulation to lymph nodes. The dye collects in the lymph nodes and these nodes glow when lit with a black light. Just like in college, remember?  
Many feel that ICG will eventually be utilized to identify other lymphatic vessels and appropriate lymph nodes intraoperatively, permitting immediate surgical resection.  
  
**Liver Surgery and Laparoscopy:**  
ICG has already been used for many years as a test for hepatic function and to measure hepatic blood flow. ICG may possibly become a valuable tool for assessing the indication for venous reconstruction in living donor liver transplantation and/or a split donor liver transplantation. It may one day become a future tool for clinical exploration for hepatocellular carcinoma and for routine intraoperative imaging during hepatic resection.  
Sentinel lymph node detection has been one main application of ICG in laparoscopic studies including early gastric cancer treatment and gastrectomy.  
  
**Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy:**  
While ICG is rapidly excreted via the bile duct, it is most natural to apply ICG intraoperatively to aid in bile examination and operations. Several groups have recently showed how ICG can be used to aid both open and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. An earlier work by Ikeda, et al., uses ICG for monitoring primary sclerosing cholangitis.  
  
**Kidney Transplant:**  
ICG is used for Intraoperative assessment of blood flow during kidney transplantations. ICG Angiograms have been used for intraoperative assessment of kidney allograft perfusion. The intraoperative assessment of renal vasculature after revascularization of a transplanted kidney has been used.  
  
**Ophthalmic Angiography:** ICG is currently being used in most Eye centers for:  
Highly selective chorioretinal disorders, including certain forms of neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration, other neovascular maculopathies, chronic central serous chorioretinopathy, choroidal hemangiomas, and posterior uveitis.  
  
**More Notes:**  
Indocyanine green dye was developed for near-infrared (NIR) photography by the Kodak Research Laboratories in 1955 and was approved for clinical use already in 1956. However, it took over ten years before ICG was used for angiography in the OR.  
  
**ICG FACTS AND TIDBITS:**  
Tested in 1957 at the Mayo Clinic for use in human medicine.  
FDA approved 1959 for hepatic function testing.  
Later used in cardiology.  
1964 used determine renal blood flow.  
Later used for the diagnosis of subretinal processes in the choroid portion of the eye.  
1980s brought the development of new photometric measuring devices for better uses of ICG. Became the standard for fluorescent angiography in ophthalmology.  
  
Today, we may administer it in the operating room during surgical procedures to evaluate real time tissue or organ perfusion in different medical procedures.  
  
**Penetration:**  
ICG works in the so-called tissue optical window, that is, the NIR light used both in excitation and fluorescence lighting penetrates tissue several millimeters or even further. This translucency helps to observe, for example, vascular structures that might be buried in clots or dura.  
Around 3,000 scientific papers on ICG have now been published worldwide.
