### Succinylcholine and nNMBAs - Contraindications with Coexisting Diseases and Conditions

**_Note:_** _Most anesthesia providers now generally avoid the administration of succinylcholine to all pediatric patients (esp. males) under 10 years old for nonurgent procedures._

| Disease | Succinylcholine | Non-depolarizers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Age: Neonate** | Require higher dose.  
1.5-2.0 mg/kg | May have faster onset and longer duration. |
| **Age: Elderly** | Decrease dose  
prolonged onset. | Decrease dose, prolonged  
onset, longer duration. |
| **ALS  
(Lou Gehrig Disease)** | Contraindicated | Hypersensitive |
| **Burn patient**  
(3rd degree burns > 25%  
of total body surface) | Contraindicated  
24 hours after burn injury. | Increased resistance |
| **Cerebral Palsy (CP)** | Slight hypersensitivity | May show resistance  
or prolonged recovery. |
| **Cirrhosis/Hepatic Disease** | May need to increase dose.  
Possible increased duration. | Use Cisatracurium |
| **Critically ill or immobilized > 3 days** | Caution: May cause severe hyperkalemia. | Safe, unless contraindicated coexisting  
disease is present requiring a lower dose. |
| **Crush Injuries-Muscle trauma** | Caution: May cause severe hyperkalemia. | Normal |
| **Guillain-Barre Syndrome** | Contraindicated | Hypersensitive |
| **Hemiplegia** | Caution: May cause severe hyperkalemia. | Increase resistance on affected side. |
| **Hepatic/Cirrhosis, Liver Disease** | Not contraindicated,  
but may prolong effects due to a decreased  
plasma cholinesterase level. | Use Cisatracurium  
Vecuronium: Excretion- liver 80%, Renal 20%  
Rocuronium: Excretion- liver 70%, Renal 30% |
| **Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis** | Contraindicated | Normal |
| **Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis** | Normal | Normal |
| **Increased ICP** | May slightly increase ICP | Little change |
| **Increased Intraocular Pressure (IOP)** | Slight temporary increase in IOP.  
Not absolutely contraindicated for open eye injury. | Normal |
| **Malignant Hyperthermia** | Contraindicated | Normal |
| **Multiple Sclerosis** | Caution: May cause severe hyperkalemia. | Hypersensitive |
| **Muscular Denervation**  
(peripheral nerve injury) | Relatively contraindicated.  
May cause severe hyperkalemia  
and contractures. | Hypersensitive |
| **Muscular Dystrophy (Duchenne)**  
and other dystrophinopathies | Contraindicated | Unpredictable Reports of normal  
and sporadic cases of  
increased sensitivity. |
| **Myasthenic Gravis (MG)** | Resistance | Hypersensitive |
| **Myasthenic Syndrome (Lambert Eaton)** | Hypersensitive | Hypersensitive |
| **Myotonias: Myotonic Dystrophy**  
and Paramyotonia Congenital | Relatively contraindicated.  
May cause generalized muscle contractions. | Normal to Hypersensitive |
| **Obesity** | Increase resistance | Normal |
| **Plasma Pseudocholinesterase**  
Deficiency | Contraindicated | Normal |
| **Renal Failure** | Not contraindicated.  
Patient should have recent dialysis  
and normal K+ levels. May be prolonged. | Use Cisatracurium  
Vecuronium: Excretion- liver 80%, Renal 20%  
Rocuronium: Excretion- liver 70%, Renal 30% |
| **Severe Sepsis/Chronic Infection:**  
Clostridium Tetanus (lockjaw)  
and Clostridium Botulism  
and other exotoxin infections. | Caution: May cause severe hyperkalemia. |   
May increases resistance. |
| **Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) > 24 hours** | Use with caution  
post 24 hours if SCI. | Normal |

**  
  
Other reasons NOT to use SCh  
**Hypersensitivity to succinylcholine or parabens.  
  
**Use SCh cautiously in patients with:**  
History of anaphylaxis to other neuromuscular blockers.  
Familial history of malignant hyperthermia.  
History of pulmonary disease, renal or liver impairment.  
Glaucoma  
Electrolyte disturbances  
Receiving digoxin  
**OB:** Has been used in pregnant women undergoing cesarean section.
