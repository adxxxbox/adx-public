Colectomy - Transverse     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Colectomy - Transverse

Resection of the transverse colon with an end-to-end anastomosis to reestablish continuity of the colon.  
**Indications:** Treat inflammatory bowel disease, strictures or tumors.  
These can be laparoscopic or an open procedure; mostly laparoscopic.  
**Anesthesia:** Similar to the other colon procedures.  
If laparoscopic, hydration is not much of an issue as compared to an open belly, thus less insensible water loss.  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT, usually RSI    
**Nitrous Oxide:** No  
**Thoracic Epidural:** Sometimes, not as common anymore. Helps for post op pain.  
**Duration:** 1-3 hours  
**IV Access:** 1 18G for a lap, and 2 for an open procedure.  
**Typed and Screen**: Yes  
**EBL:** 50-200 mLs, depends on the surgeon.  
**OG Tube:** Yes, unless they want an NG tube. NG tubes are becoming more rare.  
**A-Line:** Usually not indicated.  
**Neo Drip:** On standby  
**Position:** Supine and some Trendelenburg.  
**Bowel Prep:** Usually not because the surgery focuses on the ascending colon.   
**Fluid Deficit:** Depends if there was a bowel prep. 

**Possible Complications**  
Postoperative Intussusception-rare  
Anastomosis Leakage- especially in cases of partial resection in transverse colectomy without mobilization of the splenic flexure.  
Hemorrhage
