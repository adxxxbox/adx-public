### Chin Surgery (Mentoplasty)

Mentoplasty is a term that refers to plastic surgery procedures for the chin.  
It comes from the Latin word _mentum_ , which means chin, and the Greek verb, _plassein_ which means "to form" or "to shape."  
Mentoplasty is also known as genioplasty or “chinplasty”.  
  
**Genioplasty**  
Genioplasty can be performed by inserting a chin implant to augment a receding chin, or by the surgical advancement of the bone itself.  
  
This procedure may be performed alone or in conjunction with other plastic procedures.  
  
**There are two main types of Genioplasty:**  
Chin implants.  
Sliding Genioplasty (osseous Genioplasty).  
  
**Chin Implants**  
**For a chin implant the incision is in one of two possible locations:**  
Under the lower lip inside the mouth.  
Under the chin in an inconspicuous location.  
  
The implant is placed in an appropriately sized pocket.  
Sizers are used to achieve the best appearance; then the actual implant is carefully placed, and the incisions are closed.  
  
**Anesthesia for Chin implants:** General/Nasal ETT or monitored anesthesia care with sedation.  
  
In case of an intraoperative complication, for example - bleeding in the floor of the mouth, general anesthesia is preferable.  
**Duration:** 1-3 hours. Depends on the surgeon.  
**Position:** Supine, arms tucked or to the side and table rotated 45-90 degrees.  
The surgeon is usually positioned behind the head of the patient.  
**EBL:** Minimal.  
  
**Possible complications of chin augmentation using an implant  
**Implant malposition.  
Under-or over-augmentation.  
Infection.  
Allergic reaction to implant.  
Extrusion of implant.  
Mental nerve injury.  
Mentalis muscle dysfunction.  
Chin hypethesia or dysesthesia.  
  
**Sliding Genioplasty** (osseous Genioplasty)  
The incision will be made under the lower lip inside the mouth followed by use of a power saw with a special blade to separate the edge of the chin bone.  
The surgeon moves the separated chin-bone tip forward and positions it with wires or special bone plates and screws.  
Finally, the surgeon closes the incision and applies tape to the chin area.  
Wires or plates can be removed if they cause discomfort.  
  
**Possible Complications of Sliding Genioplasty** (osseous Genioplasty)  
Infection.  
Exposure of screws.  
Mental nerve injury.  
Mentalis muscle dysfunction.  
Chin hypesthesia or dysesthesia.  
Lower lip incompetence, retraction, and chin ptosis due to muscle dysfunction.  
Anesthesia complications.  
  
Patients may experience lack of sensitivity in the chin or lip area; however, the numbness is usually temporary. In rare cases, sensitivity loss may be permanent.  
  
**There are several ways to conduct a sliding genioplasty**  
Advancement or moving the chin forward.  
Pushback or moving the chin backward.  
Side-to-side, which can help with asymmetrical chins.  
Vertical changes, such as making the chin longer or shorter.
