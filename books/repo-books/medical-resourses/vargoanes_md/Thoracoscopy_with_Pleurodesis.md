### Thoracoscopy with Pleurodesis

Edited by Kyle J. Crawford DNP, CRNA, APRN

Adjunct Professor at University of Tennessee at Chattanooga

-   A thoracoscopic procedure that uses a thoracoscope to visualize the pleural space and then the surgeon performs a pleurodesis.
-   Anesthesia management may be similar as a VATS procedure involving a left main DLT to collapse and re-expand the lung on the side of treatment.

**Note:** Some surgeons will not request a DLT for all procedures.

**Common indications:**

Recurrent malignant pleural effusions (patients with cancer)

Recurrent pneumothorax

Recent pneumonia with associated recurrent/persistent pleural effusion

**Pleurodesis:**

-   A thoracoscope is inserted through one or more small incisions to access the pleural cavity.
-   Any pleural fluid or air is removed to collapse the lung partially, improving visibility and access to the pleural space.
-   The pleural cavity is then carefully inspected for lesions, adhesions, or abnormalities.
-   The surgeon will then preform either a mechanical or chemical pleurodesis to scar that will result in scarring the pleural layers thus, resulting in the closure of the pleural space.

**Goal:** Preventing the recurrence of pleural effusions or pneumothorax by inducing adhesions between the parietal and visceral pleural (pleural space).

**Chemical vs Mechanical Pleurodesis:**

**Mechanical abrasion:**

-   A sterile surgical pad, gauze, or specialized pleural abrader gently rubs the parietal pleura, creating uniform abrasions.
-   This induces an inflammatory response that promotes the release of cytokines and fibrin deposition, leading to pleural adhesion and fibrosis.
-   It is typically recommended for pneumothorax patients at risk of recurrence.

**Chemical pleurodesis (abrasion):**

-   Chemical pleurodesis involves introducing a sclerosant, such as talc, tetracycline derivatives, or iodopovidone, into the pleural space to induce an inflammatory response that promotes the release of cytokines and fibrin deposition, leading to pleural adhesion and fibrosis.
-   Care must be taken to avoid damaging underlying structures, such as the intercostal nerves and blood vessels.
-   After the pleurodesis, the pleural cavity is inspected for complications like bleeding or lung injury.
-   A small-bore chest tube or tunneled pleural catheter is inserted to drain any remaining pleural fluid or air and is typically left in place until fluid output is minimal and pleural adherence is confirmed.
-   The lung is then re-expanded to its full volume to ensure contact between the visceral and parietal pleura, facilitating adhesion formation.

**Anesthesia:**

-   General/ETT (usually a Left DLT-Double Lumen Tube)
-   Ask the surgeon if he/she wants a DLT to collapse the affected lung.
-   Not all procedures require collapsing a lung, so verify with the surgeon pre-operatively.

**When using single lumen ETT:**

Utilize smaller tidal volumes

Avoid peep during surgical intervention

Intermittent breath holds may be requested by the surgeon

-   If placement of DLT is unsuccessful and need lung isolation is needed, bronchial blockers are a secondary option.
-   Pleural effusions will decrease FRC, which can lead to quick oxygen desaturations during airway management.
-   If preoperative pneumothorax present, RSI and isolate lungs prior to positive pressure ventilation (ppv). PPV will worsen the pneumothorax, assuming there is no chest tube in place preoperatively.
-   Attempt to utilize lowest FiO2 possible in order to decrease fire risk.
-   SpO2 goals are typically patient & situation specific, but (generally) attempt to keep SpO2 92% or greater.
-   For details on managing DLTs, refer to “Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATs)” within this app.

**Regional anesthesia:** Erector spinae plane (ESP) or Paravertebral block

**Note:** The thoracic surgeon may prefer perform their own block prior to closing.

The thoracic surgeon may prefer perform their own block prior to closing.

**Duration:** 1-3 hours

**Arterial line:** Not always indicated

**PIVs:** Two

**Position:** Lateral

**EBL:** Minimal

**Possible complications of Pleurodesis**

Pain and inflammation-may require NSAIDs or opioid

Fever is a common inflammatory response.

Infection

Pneumothorax

Hemothorax

Atelectasis

Re-expansion pulmonary edema

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

Systemic inflammation

Pulmonary embolism

**Possible causes of a failure of pleurodesis:**

Trapped lung

Inadequate lung expansion

Insufficient inflammatory response

Increased tumor burden, which causes a decrease in the mesothelial cells and, therefore, an inadequate inflammatory response.

**More pleural space notes:**

-   The pleural space (cavity) is a potential space between the parietal and visceral pleura that normally contains a small amount (10–20 mL) of lubricating fluid.
-   This fluid facilitates smooth lung movement during respiration
-   The parietal pleura lines the thoracic cavity, diaphragm, and mediastinum.
-   The visceral pleura covers the lungs.
-   Both pleural layers comprise mesothelial cells supported by a connective tissue matrix containing blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerve fibers.
-   Under normal conditions, pleural fluid production and absorption are balanced, resulting in no net accumulation
-   Other risk factors for unsuccessful pleurodesis include previous thoracic irradiation and a chest tube duration of more than 10 days.
-   Trapped lung: the longer the pleural effusion has been present, the more likely the lung will not fully re-expand to volumes that preceded the effusion
-   Sometimes the surgeon will opt to strip pleural tissue from the chest wall (pleurectomy). Bleeding risk is not high, but risk increases the closer the surgeon strips to the spine as it is harder to tamponade and control (compared to anterior chest wall).

**Sclerosing agents for chemical pleurodesis:**

Talc

Tetracyclines (minocycline, doxycycline)

Silver nitrate

Iodopovidone

Bleomycin

Corynebacterium parvum with parenteral methylprednisolone acetate

Erythromycin

Fluorouracil

Interferon beta

Autologous blood

Mitomycin C

Cisplatin

Cytarabine

Doxorubicin

Etoposide

Bevacizumab (intravenous or intrapleural)
