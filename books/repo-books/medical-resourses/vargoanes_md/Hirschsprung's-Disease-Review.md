Hirschsprung's Disease Review   

## Hirschsprung's Disease Review

Hirschsprung's is also known as Colonic Aganglionosis or Congenital Megacolon.

**Hirschsprung's disease**  
Ganglion cells form during fetal development, between the 5th and 12th weeks of pregnancy, and are present in the entire digestive tract. These ganglion cells (intrinsic nerve supply of the bowel) are responsible for peristalsis. Sometimes, for an unknown reason, ganglion cells fail to develop in the distal colon to the rectum. Normal peristaltic movement cannot occur in the effected area, the patient cannot defecate, resulting in abdominal distension. If left untreated, Hirschsprung's disease can be life threatening.

In rare cases, aganglionosis extends the entire length of the gastrointestinal tract, a condition that is often fatal. There may also be deficiencies of nitric oxide synthase activity in the affected intestinal walls.  
  
The lack of nitric oxide–producing nerve fibers in the aganglionic bowel probably contributes to the inability of intestinal smooth muscle to relax appropriately, thereby impairing peristalsis. Tonic contraction of involved bowel produces a functional obstruction.

Once Hirschsprung's is diagnosed, treatment is focused on removing the aganglionic area and anastomose the functional ganglionic bowel to the distal anal canal (transanal anastomosis).

Pull-through procedure for Hirschsprung's is also known as Soave, Duhamel, Swenson Pull-through.

About 5-15 % of patients with Hirschsprung's disease have Trisomy 21.

70% of cases, the sigmoid portion to the rectum lack ganglion cells (aganglionic).

Hirschsprung's causes 15 to 20% of intestinal obstructions in newborns.

Most cases are diagnosed within the first six weeks after birth.

If the disease affects only a small portion of the bowel, resulting in just constipation, this explains why it may take so long to discover the problem.

The repair procedure can be minimally invasive or open. Stable infants are candidates for minimally invasive surgery. Sometimes both approaches are used at different stages of treatment to do different things.

Hirschsprung's disease is rare, occurring in an estimated 1 in 5,000 births. It is more common in males than in females.

The general goals of medical care are 3-fold:  
(1) to treat the manifestations and complications of  
(2) to institute temporizing measures until definitive reconstructive surgery  
(3) to manage postoperative bowel function

In some cases, the disease may have a genetic link.

**Specific treatment for Hirschsprung's disease will be determined by:**  
How much of the intestines are affected by the disease  
The child's age, overall health, and medical history  
How well the child can handle certain drugs, procedures, or therapies  
The expected outcomes of the disease

**Pull-through Procedure**  
The endorectal pull-through procedure essentially requires the removal of the rectal mucosa and submucosa to create an aganglionic cuff through which normal ganglionic intestine is brought through. In many cases, this can be performed as a primary or one-stage procedure, avoiding the need for a leveling colostomy. Advantages of an endorectal dissection include the avoidance of trauma to sensory nerves in the rectum and preservation of the internal sphincter.
