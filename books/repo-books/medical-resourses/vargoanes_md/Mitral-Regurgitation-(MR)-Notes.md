### Mitral Regurgitation (MR) Notes

MR results from leaflet, chordal or papillary muscle abnormalities, or is secondary to left ventricular dysfunction.  
**Leaflet MR** is a complication of endocarditis, rheumatic fever or mitral valve prolapse.  
**Chordal MR** follows chordae rupture after acute myocardial infarction or after bacterial endocarditis.  
**Papillary muscle MR** results from ischemic posterior papillary muscle dysfunction.  
Left ventricular failure leads to varying amounts of MR when the mitral annulus dilates.

As much as 50% of the LV volume flows back or regurgitates into a massively dilated left atrium through the incompetent mitral valve before the aortic valve opens. Pulmonary vascular congestion develops followed by pulmonary hypertension.

The degree of regurgitation is determined by the afterload, size of the regurgitant orifice and the heart rate. Increased heart rate >90 bpm decreases the time for regurgitation in systole and decreases the time for diastolic filling, thus reducing LV overload.

Stroke volume is maintained until late in the disease process despite as much as 50% of the left ventricular volume being ejected into the left atrium through the regurgitant mitral valve.

**Acute MR**: develops quickly and can be life-threatening. It happens when the valve or nearby tissues rupture suddenly. Instead of a slow leak, blood builds up quickly in the left side of the heart. The heart doesn't have time to adjust to this sudden buildup of blood like it does with a slow buildup of blood in chronic regurgitation. Common causes of acute regurgitation are heart attack and a heart infection called endocarditis.

These patients come off pump much easier because everything appears quickly reversible once a new valve is inserted. Acute mitral regurgitation may manifest with fulminant pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock; the murmur in this setting is usually only in early and mid-systole.

**Chronic MR:** The most common type of Mitral Regurgitation; it develops slowly. Many people with this problem may have a valve that is prone to wear and tear. As the person gets older, the valve gets weak and no longer closes tightly. Other causes include heart failure, rheumatic fever, congenital heart disease, a calcium buildup in the valve, and other heart problems.

**Eccentric Hypertrophy**: There can be eccentric hypertrophy with elevated PAP and pulmonary congestion. If the ventricle is impaired, patients are more difficult to come off pump.

**Pulmonary Hypertension:**  
Occurs when the blood backs up and the pressure in the pulmonary vein is increased. This increases the workload of the right side of the heart, making it difficult to provide an adequate amount of oxygenated blood to the body.

**Causes of MR**:  
Infective endocarditis (IE)  
Caused by bacteria, fungi, or other organisms that invade the bloodstream. The organisms adhere to the valves and grow, while abnormal structures known as vegetation develop on the heart valves. The vegetation can prevent the mitral valve from closing normally, allowing blood to regurgitate. A heart valve that is already abnormal is more likely to develop endocarditis compared to a valve that is normal.  
  
**Rheumatic fever**  
Rheumatic fever is a body-wide illness that occurs when the bacterium that causes Strep throat (group A Streptococcus) is not treated. Rheumatic fever causes inflammation of the valves of the heart, as well as other complications.

Rheumatic fever is now uncommon in developed countries, although it still occurs commonly in developing countries.

**Congenital**  
Congenital mitral regurgitation is very rare and is usually secondary to some other associated congenital abnormalities. Marfan’s syndrome.

**Trauma**  
Chest trauma can rarely cause breakage of the chords that hold the mitral leaflets in their normal position. Untethered leaflets swing widely, allowing valve leakage.

**Other**  
An anti-obesity drug named Fen-Phen contained Fenfluramine, which was shown in several post-use studies to cause mitral valve disease and cardiac fibrosis. Fen-Phen caused thickening of the valve leaflets and chordae tendinae. It was pulled from the market in the United States after only around 10 years of use in 1997.
