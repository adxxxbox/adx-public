Local Anesthetics and Protein Binding    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Local Anesthetics and Protein Binding

Local anesthetics have a higher affinity to bind to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein than albumin.  
(acidic drugs are more likely bind to albumin).  
  
This property of protein binding also correlates with their affinity for protein within sodium channels and predicts the duration they will sustain neural blockade.  
  
Bupivacaine has the greatest percent protein binding and is the longest acting of local anesthetics.  
  
Therefore, highly bound drugs have a long duration of action on the Na Channels within the nerve it is blocking.  
  
The intrinsic vascular effects of the drug and the total dose given also influence its duration of action.
