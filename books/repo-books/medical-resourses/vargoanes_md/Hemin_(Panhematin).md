Hemin (Panhematin)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Hemin (Panhematin)

-   Treatment for acute intermittent attacks of porphyria
-   May also be used for mild attacks to prevent the progression to an acute severe attack
-   NOT indicated in _Porphyria Cutanea Tarda_ (most common subtype of porphyria)
-   Hemin is typically administered by a specialist in a medical setting
-   Hemin is also referred to as heme arginate

**Dose range:** 1 to 4 mg/kg/day for 3 to 14 days based on the clinical signs

**Standard dosage:** Single Q-day dose of 3 to 4 mg/kg x 4 days

-   In more severe cases, the dose may be repeated no earlier than every 12 hours
-   No more than 6 mg/kg per 24-hour period
-   Reconstituted with sterile water
-   Administered over 20 minutes
-   When Panhematin is reconstituted with 48 mL, it contains the equivalent of ~336 mg hematinat a concentration of 7 mg/mL

**mL to infuse =** Prescribed Dosage (mg/kg) x Patient Weight (kg)  
7 mg/mL Concentration of Reconstituted PANHEMATIN

_(PANHEMATIN is supplied as a sterile, lyophilized, black powder in single-dose dispensing vials containing 350 mg hemin, 240 mg sodium carbonate, and 335 mg sorbitol)_

-   _Prior to reconstitution, PANHEMATIN should be stored at room temperature (68°-77°F)_
-   _PANHEMATIN contains no preservative, and it undergoes rapid chemical decomposition in solution_

-   _Therefore, PANHEMATIN should not be reconstituted until immediately before use_

**Onset**

-   Jones et al. reported that abdominal pain can be relieved within 15 minutes of administering Hematin
-   However, symptoms may not improve until 24 to 48 hours
-   Patients are ready for discharge by the third or fourth day

**For severe and frequent attacks**

-   The hematologist may increase the frequency of Hemin

**Hemin is commonly indicated when the patient with an acute attack requires**

-   Hospitalization
-   Opioid analgesia
-   Other intravenous medication
-   Presence of paresis
-   Presence of seizures
-   Agitation, delirium and/or psychosis
-   Hyponatremia

**Hemin should be administered early**

-   It is essential to administer hemin before established neuropathy because it will not reverse it
-   Hemin cannot be used prophylactically, indeed too frequent use may, by inducing the enzyme heme oxygenase, induce its own catabolism with resultant loss of effect

**Mechanism of action**

-   Hemin becomes bound mostly to circulating albumin as heme albumin, and some is bound to hemopexin
-   It is then taken up primarily by hepatocytes, where the heme component reconstitutes the regulatory heme pool
-   This results the down reregulation hepatic ALAS1 synthesis, followed by dramatic reductions in ALA and PBG in plasma and urine within 24 hours.

**Hemin cannot be used prophylactically**

-   Indeed too frequent use may, by inducing the enzyme heme oxygenase, induce its own catabolism with resultant loss of effect

**Adverse effects**

-   Most common, Greater than 1% of patients have
    -   Headache
    -   Pyrexia
    -   Infusion site reactions
    -   Phlebitis
        -   Phlebitis with or without leukocytosis or pyrexia when administered through small arm veins
    -   Reversible renal shutdown has occurred with excessive doses
    -   Utilize a large arm vein or a central venous catheter for administration to minimize the risk of phlebitis
    -   Repeated or excessive doses have been shown results in iron overload-related complications (reversible renal shutdown)
    -   However, the total amount of iron administered in the form of heme arginate is comparable to less than two units of packed red cells

  
**Contraindications:** Patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug.  
**Hemin has a mild anticoagulant effect**

-   Avoid concurrent anticoagulant therapy

**Pregnancy**

-   Anecdotal evidence suggests the safe use of hematin during pregnancy, the available human data is not sufficient to establish the presence or absence of drug associated risk
-   Avoid administering hematin in severe pre-eclampsia because of a theoretical risk of potentiation of the coagulation disorder

**Lactation**

-   It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk

**Pediatric use**

-   Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 16 years of age have not been established

**More notes**

-   Do not use in patients with known hypersensitivity to PANHEMATIN
-   Elevated iron and serum ferritin may occur
-   Monitor iron and serum ferritin in patients receiving multiple administrations
