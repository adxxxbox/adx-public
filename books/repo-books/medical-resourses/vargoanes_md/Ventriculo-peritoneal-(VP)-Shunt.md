Ventriculo-peritoneal (VP Shunt) Insertion     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Ventriculo-peritoneal (VP

### Shunt) Insertion

**Other known shunts:**  
VA=Ventriculo-atrial Shunt  
Ventriculo-Pleural Shunt

**Age range:** premature neonates to post puberty children.  
  
VP shunting is a surgery to treat hydrocephalus. A thin catheter is inserted into the brain to shunt CSF from the lateral ventricles of the brain into the peritoneum.  
The surgeon USUALLY makes a cut in the right parietal area (behind the right ear). Sometimes a frontal incision is made instead.  A burr hole is made and a small catheter is passed into a ventricle of the brain. It can also be done with assistance of an endoscope.   
A small abdominal incision is made into the rectus abdominal sheath for access to the peritoneum. The distal catheter is then tunneled from under the skin and Sub Q tissue from behind the ear, the neck and all the way down to the peritoneal cavity. This tunneling is the most stimulating part of the surgery, so make sure the patient is deep.

A fluid pump with valve is placed underneath the skin behind the ear. The valve is connected to both catheters. When extra pressure builds up around the brain, the valve opens, and excess fluid drains out of it into the belly or chest area. This helps decrease intracranial pressure. The valves in newer shunts can be programmed to drain more or less fluid from the brain.  
  
**Pre-OP**  
These patients are mostly kids. Check to see if they are on anti-convulsant meds because they alter drug metabolism. Be careful with sedation, since you know that hypoventilation increases CO2 which increases ICP and may lower the seizure threshold.  
Look for possible co-morbidities: congenital cardiac disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, kypho-scoliosis, recurrent respiratory infections secondary to neurological dysfunction.  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT with the head slightly elevated.  
**Position:** Supine, arms to the side, head turned to the left, the contralateral side of the shunt insertion. Sometimes a shoulder roll will be used.  
Aggressive neck flexion may cause the ETT to migrate into the right mainstem. So watch your peak pressures and SaO2.  
The bed is usually rotated 90 degrees, so make sure your ventilater tubing, IV tubing and other cords are out of the way and on the patient’s left side.  
**EKG leads:** Place on the patient’s back because the right anterior surface of the chest is prepped.  
**Bed is usually rotated 90 degrees:** Yes  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**EBL:** minimal  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
**Ventilation:** Maintain a mild hyperventilation if an elevated ICP is involved.  
Do not over hyperventilate. A surgeon once asked me to ventilate normally, because it could become difficult to cannulate the ventricle if it is empty from hyperventilation.  
**Other suggested meds:** Ofirmev and anti-emetics.  
**Fluid warmer:** It is suggested, but most of us don’t. A large portion of the patient is exposed, making the patient prone to hypothermia.  
**Warming Blanket:** Lower body or underbody, depending on age and size of the patient.  
**A-line:** Usually not.

**Possible Complications**  
Head bleed  
Brain swelling  
Bowel perforation  
Leakage of CSF fluid under the skin  
Infection of the shunt or brain  
Damage to brain tissue  
Seizures  
The shunt may malfunction, thus requiring a surgical repair.
