### Spinal Doses for C-Sections by Others

**Spinal Doses  
0.75% Bupivacaine** (7.5mg/mL)(hyperbaric) is the most common local anesthetic used in spinals for C-sections today.  
**  
Common Range of 0.75% Bupivacaine – depending on height:**  
1.2-1.8 mLs which is 9-13.5 mg is common by others  
Smaller dose for short and more for taller patients  
  
**Preservative Free (PF) Morphine (Astromorph, Duramorph)** **common dose range for Spinal/C-sections**  
0.1-0.25 mg of Astromorph is commonly added Bupivacaine  
  
**Preservative Free (PF) Fentanyl common dose range for Spinal/C-sections  
**10-25 mcg of Fentanyl is commonly added to Bupivacaine  
  
It is common to add (mix) Fentanyl and Astromorph with Bupivacaine in a spinal dose for a C-section.**  
  
Doses for different heights**  
_For height, many providers will add 0.1 mL for each inch above 5’0” to a max of 2mL.__  
On the flip side, many providers administer the same dose between the 5’0” - 6’0.”  
_Some literature states that there is no correlation between patient height and weight and the level of block obtained for patients height between 5’0” - 6’0.” So many providers still do not adjust their local anesthetic doses between that range **.**  
  
**Different 0.75% Bupivicaine doses per HEIGHT used by others below:  
****< 5’0” (** 1.0- 1.4 mL)  
**5’1”-5’4”** (1.1-1.6 mL)  
**5’5”-5’9”** (1.2-1.8 mL)  
**\> 5’10”** (1.3-1.8)  
  
**_Tim Lehey, CRNA  
_SAB Dose:** 1.3 mLs of 0.75% Bupivacaine.  
I only modify the dose at the extremes of height (< 5’0” or > 5’10”).  
**< 5 feet tall:** 1.1 or 1.2 mLs and consider adding 20mcg of fentanyl.  
**\> 5 feet 10:** 1.3 or 1.4 mLs.  
I don't add extra Fentanyl for taller patients because the pruritus is real, maddening to the parturient and refractory to treatment.  
  
**Alyson Eastep CRNA, North Santee, SC, CRNA  
SAB Dose:** I dose my C-sections on the light side.  
**< 5’4”** : 1.2 mLs of 0.75% Bupivacaine with 15mcg of Fentanyl and 0.15 mg of Duramorph.  
**5’4”-5’5”:** 1.3 mLs of 0.75% Bupivacaine with 15mcg of Fentanyl and 0.15 mg of Duramorph.  
**\> 5'6”:** 1.5 mLs of 0.75% Bupivacaine with 15mcg of Fentanyl and 0.15 mg of Duramorph.  
If my C-section duration is expected > 1.5 hours, I add an Epi wash to the syringe.  
  
**Tabatha Taylor LeMay, CRNA, Virginia Beach, VA, CRNA  
SAB Dose:** 1.5 mLs of 0.75% Bupivacaine  
20mcg Fentanyl  
0.2mg Duramorph  
I only modify at <5’0” or > 5'10"  
**< 5’0”:** 1.3-1.4 mLs of 0.75% Bupivacaine with 20mcg Fentanyl and 0.2mg Duramorph.  
**\> 5’10”:** 1.6 mLs of 0.75% Bupivacaine with 20mcg Fentanyl and 0.2mg Duramorph  
  
**Chuck Frisch, CRNA**  
**SAB dose:** 1.6 mLs of 0.75% Bupivicaine in dextrose  
0.1 mL of 1:1000 Epi  
No narcotics for 24 hours, unless approved by a group partner and 24-hour SaO 2 monitoring.  
0.1mg of Duramorph.  
No difference in weight or height. Where I work, my surgeons are really slow at C-sections so that is why I add the Epi to increase duration.  
  
**Jennifer Smith Sealman, CRNA**  
1 mL of Bupivacaine 0.75% in dextrose 8.25%  
I start out at 5'0"= 1ml, then add 0.1mL/inch to max of 2mL (15 mg)  
I add 100mcg of PF Dilaudid (1mg/mL)  
In my experience, Dilaudid has less side effects than Duramorph  
  
**Tim Marble, CRNA  
SAB Dose:**  
1.2 to 2.0 mLs of 0.75 % Bupivacaine  
0.2 mg of Duramorph  
  
**Jeremy Dufrene, CRNA**  
SAB Dose  
< 5'5" I use 1.6 mL of 0.75% Marcaine + 0.25 mg of Duramorph  
\>5'5" or greater is use 1.8 mL of 0.75% Marcaine + 0.25 mg of Duramorph  
I will also do an Epi wash for a couple of our slower OB docs  
  
**Chance Airhart, CRNA  
**1.6 ml of 0.75 Bupivacaine with 20mcg Fentanyl and 0.3mg Duramorph  
  
**Keven Keller, CRNA  
**1.4 mLs of 0.75% Bupivacaine for < 5’2”  
1.6 mLs of 0.75% Bupivacaine for > 5’2”  
I sometimes add 12.5mg Demerol  
  
**Gabriel Spence, CRNA**  
1.6 ml of 0.75 Bupivacaine with 20mcg Fentanyl and 0.3mg Duramorph  
Depending on patient’s fluid status, I’ll administer 25mg Ephedrine in the spinal.  
I never have to give pressors.  
  
**Betty Macias, CRNA  
**1.6 ml of 0.75 Bupivacaine with 10mcg Fentanyl and 0.2mg of Duramorph  
  
**Bryan Liu, CRNA  
**1.4-1.8 mLs of 0.75% Bupivacaine of an epi syringe swishing and 0.2mg Duramorph  
  
**Matthew Earl, CRNA  
**1.6 ml of 0.75 Bupivacaine with 10mcg Fentanyl and 0.2mg of Duramorph  
  
**Rhonda Wildurn Day, CRNA  
**1.6 ml of 0.75 Bupivacaine with 15mcg Fentanyl and 0.2mg of Duramorph  
I don’t lower for short people. I have everyone sit for 15-30 seconds and then lay them down.  
I rarely have to treat for hypotension.  
  
**Louis G. Stanfield, CRNA**  
2.5 mLs of 0.5%Bupivacaine (isobaric) and 0.3mg of Buprenorphine  
If I don’t have it, I add 25mcg Fentanyl and .25mg Duramorph.  
Slower onset of sympathectomy with 0.5%. Everybody appears to settle at T4 level.  
  
**Ira Saunders, CRNA  
**1.2 - 1.4 mLs of 0.75% Marcaine and 25mcg of Fentanyl and 0.2mg Duramorph  
I also administer 25mg Ephedrine IM in the thigh or a Neo drip as needed.  
  
**Mike Tarpoff, CRNA  
**2.0 ml of 0.75 Bupivacaine plain.**  
  
Jennifer Garris, CRNA  
**1.6-1.8 mLs of 0.75 Bupivacaine up to 2 mLs for patients > 5’6” and 150 mg Dilaudid.
