### CSE and Fetal Bradycardia

  
CSE:(Combined Spinal Epidural)  

CSE is associated with a significantly greater incidence of FHR abnormalities related to uterine hypertonus compared with epidural analgesia. The faster the pain relief after analgesia, the higher the probability of uterine hypertonus and FHR changes.  
  
Patients prone to fetal bradycardia usually those who have had preexisting fetal stress and those in tumultuous labor.  
  
CSE’s should be avoided when there are preexisting fetal heart rate (FHR) abnormalities or a non-reassuring FHR.  
  
On the flip side, one may also expect fetal bradycardia any time after adequate analgesia is delivered to the patient, no matter which technique is used.  
  
**Cause of Fetal Bradycardia  
**Fetal bradycardia may be due to uterine hypertonus resulting from loss of beta-sympathetic tocolytic effect as epinephrine concentrations rapidly decline with the onset of analgesia.  
  
I tell them to visualize the effect of abruptly reversing the effects of terbutaline.  
**How we treat the fetal bradycardia:**  
0.4-0.8 Sublingual NTG spray  
10mg IV of ephedrine IV  
Lateral decubitus positioning  
O2 if it isn’t already running  
  
The mnemonic I devised for our OB personnel and students new to OB anesthesia is **“OPEN:”  
****O**pen IV and ensure Oxygenation,  
**P**osition the patient,  
**E**phedrine,  
**N**itroglycerin.  
  
If this is going to happen, it’s going to happen within 20-30 minutes after the onset of analgesia. If it occurs after that interval, it is most likely an obstetric complication and not an anesthetic one, and treatment is guided accordingly.
