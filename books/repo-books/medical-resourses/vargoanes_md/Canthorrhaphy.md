Canthorrhaphy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Canthorrhaphy

The surgical shortening of the palpebral fissure of the eyelids by suturing the canthus. The procedure is indicated when there is an adhesion of the eyelids or when exposure to the globe is inadequate.

**Anesthetic:** General, usually just an LMA.  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 22G is acceptable. A 500mL NS bag with micro drip tubing is popular.  
**Position:** Supine with arms tucked and the patient remains on the same stretcher. Make sure the ETCO2 NC is looped away from the surgical eye. The stretcher is parked 90-180 degrees away from you (unless you are starting out as a general).
