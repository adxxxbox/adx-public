### TAVR Anesthesia

  
_by J. Scott Roberts; Cardiothoracic CRNA, Charlotte, NC._

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
Amidate, Fentanyl (2cc,) Versed (2cc)  
Succinylcholine (or Rocuronium) & Vecuronium  
**Position:** Supine and arms tucked  
**Duration:** 1-3 hours  
**EBL:** 1-200mls, if everything goes well.  
**IV Access:** 2 Large Bore  
**Fluid warmers:** 2, High flow & Blood set.  
**Bed warmer:** Yes, underbody Bair Hugger.  
**A-Line:** Yes, left is preferred. With the Transapical approach, a conduit is sometimes placed in the Right subclavian artery, obliterating the distal pulse in the right arm.  
**Swan setup:** RIGHT SIDE of bed: you want all lines to come off right side due to the use of the C-arm and continuous TEE, both coming in on the Left.  
**Hydration:** <500mLs. Use a CVP and be careful not to over hydrate.  
**Note:** Literature search suggests the infusion of 500cc bolus BEFORE induction since Aortic Stenosis leads to a hypertrophied Left Ventricle that is volume dependent:  however, many patients are admitted and optimized prior to procedure, thus negating this step.

**6 pumps with the following drugs spiked and programmed in:**  
Neosynephrine 80mcg/ml  
Levophed 16mcg/ml  
NTG  
NS Carrier – Run around 20cc/hr  
Epi 8mcg/ml (spiked – hanging on pole but not connected)   
**Ready Diluted Syringes**  
Atropine  
Epi 10mcg/ml and 100mcg/ml  
Vasopressin 2u/ml  
You can pull up an 8mcg/ml Epi syringe – out of bag that I mixed (2 vials at 1:1,000 in 250ml)  
Esmolol, NTG 40mcg/ml  
Heparin (20cc – I want an ACT >250 \[range 250 to 300 preferred\])  
Have enough Heparin on hand to crash on pump if needed (ACT > 400)  
Nu-prep (stuff we use in MRI) for ECG leads  
I have found it helpful to tape leads on to reduce artifact - our leads and the ones put on by the nurses.  
**BIS monitor** – place before induction to obtain baseline

**Notes: IN THE OR: Always use**  
**Closed loop COMMUNICATION** – loud and deliberate – repeat back all requests as stated – lots of people and noise – easy to miss something.  
Cardiologist will ask you to test pacer.  
Ventricular pace usually at a rate of 180.

**Want MAP of around 40mmHg with Ventricular Standstill (pacing).**  
I give a pressor of choice (Neo or Levo – whichever is working for that patient) just before I pace. It has been my experience that BP recovers more quickly & adequately when this method is used. However, watch the MAP because you want it around 40mmHg during pacing. If it is higher during the first pacing event, you may omit vasopressor prior to pacing next time.

On your monitor, switch response of Arterial pressure from normal to Beat to Beat.

Ephedrine 25-50mg **IM** is frequently used for better recovery post pacing and more stability throughout procedure. 1-2gm of Magnesium may be given with patients experiencing frequent ectopy. It is more difficult to control hemodynamics in these patients.
