### Electrolyte and Glucose During CABG

Protocols vary among institutions.  
  
**Potassium:** (4.0-5.5mmol/l) In many centers potassium is maintained at the “higher” end of the normal range to suppress the development of arrhythmias. A value above 6.5 mmol/l should be actively treated.  
  
**Calcium:** Normal serum calcium level is 8-10 mg/dl (2-2.5 mmol/l) with some variation depending on laboratory reference values. Plasma calcium levels can be reduced by large volumes of citrated blood, leading to impaired contractility and vasodilation.  
  
**Ionized calcium:** Maintain above 1.0mmol/l.  
  
**Magnesium:** (0.8-1.40mmol/l) Serum magnesium must be maintained above 7.0mmol/l.  
  
**Lactate:** (0.7-2.5mmol/l) May be elevated with pronged cardiopulmonary bypass. Usually not treated, but used as a potential indicator of inadequate perfusion.  
  
**Glucose:** (maintain below 150 mg/dl) Lack of glucose control is associated with poor wound healing and higher morbidity. Tight glucose control is a important. Insulin drips are used with a sliding scale with blood glucose levels determined every 30-60 minutes.
