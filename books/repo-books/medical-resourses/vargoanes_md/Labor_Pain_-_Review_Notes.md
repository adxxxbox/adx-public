### Labor Pain Review Notes

**First Stage  
**In the first stage of labor, pain travels via sympathetic nerve fibers (going through the **inferior hypogastric plexus** on the way to the sympathetic chain) that originate from the **T10-L1** segments of the spinal cord (referred to the back as well as abdominal wall).  
  
**Second Stage**  
Second Stage Labor Pain is transmitted via the **pudendal nerve (S2-4).  
  
****Uterine contractions and cervical dilatation** \- visceral pain.  
These visceral pain impulses are transmitted by afferent, slow conducting, A-delta and C fibers that accompany the sympathetic nerves and enter the spinal cord at the T10 to L1 level.  
  
**As labor progresses** As labor progresses, the descent of fetal head and subsequent pressure on the pelvic floor, vagina, and perineum, generates somatic pain, which is transmitted by the pudendal nerve (S2-4). These rapidly conducting somatic pain fibers are relatively difficult to block.In obstetric patients, regional analgesia refers to partial or complete loss of pain sensation below the T8 to T10 spinal level. In addition, a varying degree of motor block may be present, depending on the agents used. Advantages of regional analgesia include the following:  
  
Labor pain has a visceral component and a somatic component. Noxious impulses from the uterus and cervix follow afferent sensory-nerve fibers that accompany sympathetic nerves, traveling through the paracervical region and the pelvic and hypogastric plexus to enter the lumbar sympathetic chain and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord through the white rami communication of the T10, T11, T12, and L1 spinal nerves.  
  
Noxious impulses from the vagina and perineum travel via the pudendal nerve to enter the spinal cord at S2 to S4.  
  
Pain during the first stage of labor (start of labor until complete cervical dilation) originates predominantly in the cervix and the lower uterine segment, rather than the body of the uterus.  
  
Dilation of the cervix and lower uterine segment results in tissue distension, stretching, and tearing. During the late first stage and second stage of labor (complete cervical dilation until delivery) the fetus descends in the birth canal and the progressively greater pressure of the fetus on the vagina and perineum become additional sources of pain.  
  
Distension of the birth canal causes intense stretching and tearing of fascia and subcutaneous tissues and pressure on the skeletal muscles of the perineum.  
  
Painful impulses from the lower uterine segment and cervix are transmitted via visceral afferent nerve fibers which accompany sympathetic nerve fibers and enter the spinal cord at the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth thoracic and first lumbar spinal segments.  
  
Somatic sensory impulses from the vagina and perineum are transmitted via the pudendal nerves to the second, third and fourth sacral spinal segments.  
  
Labor pain has a visceral component and a somatic component. Noxious impulses from the uterus and cervix follow afferent sensory-nerve fibers that accompany sympathetic nerves, traveling through the paracervical region and ...  
  
As is typical of visceral pain, the pain of the first stage of labor is often referred to the dermatomes supplied by the same spinal cord segments that receive input from the uterus and cervix (T10 to L1).  
  
Additionally, during the late first stage and second stage of labor, stimulation of pain-sensitive structures within the pelvic cavity, and pressure on one or more roots of the lumbosacral plexus may result in aching, burning, or cramping discomfort in the thigh, legs, and lower back. Stimulation of these structures contributes to pain referred to the lower lumbar and sacral segments. The pain may be severe if the fetus is in an abnormal position (eg, occiput posterior).  
  
Visceral C-fibers transmitting pain from the uterus and cervix terminate in the spinal cord in the ipsilateral superficial and deep dorsal horn and the ventral horn in a loose network of synapses, as well as crossing the midline to the contralateral dorsal horn with extensive rostrocaudal extension.  
  
In contrast, somatic afferent fibers terminate in the ipsilateral superficial laminae of the dorsal horn with minimal rostrocaudal fiber extension.  
  
Thus, first stage labor pain tends to be diffuse in nature compared to second stage labor pain.  
  
Knowledge of the anatomic basis of the transmission of labor pain underlies the current treatment of labor pain using regional anesthesia techniques. The visceral pain of the first stage of labor can be blocked with bilateral paracervical plexus or lumbar sympathetic blockade (Sacral somatic pain caused by descent of the fetus in the birth canal can be blocked with bilateral pudendal nerve blockade.  
  
Epidural and intrathecal blockade (neuraxial blockade) provides complete analgesia for both the first and second stages of labor.
