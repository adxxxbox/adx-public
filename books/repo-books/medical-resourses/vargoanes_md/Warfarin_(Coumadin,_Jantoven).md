### Warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven)

**Vitamin K Antagonist (VKA)**  
  
**Indications  
**Venous thrombosis.  
Pulmonary embolism.  
Thromboembolic complications from atrial fibrillation and/or cardiac valve replacement.  
Reduce risk of death, recurrent MIs, and thromboembolic events (eg, stroke, systemic embolization) post-MI.  
**  
Warfarin’s Target**  
Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1  
  
**Monitor:** PT and INR  
_Factor 7 is the first factor depleted, which is why the PT is affected before the aPTT._  
NOTE: In theory, response to Warfarin requires approximately 5 days and depletion of functional factors II and X to achieve effective anticoagulation. Factor VII (has shortest half-life) is in the extrinsic pathway and inhibition and inhibition does NOT provide effective anticoagulation despite causing early INR elevation (Managing Anticoagulated Patients in the Hospital. P134)  
  
**Mechanism of action  
**Warfarin inhibits vitamin K reductase, resulting in depletion of the reduced form of vitamin K (vitamin KH2). The reduced vitamin K will inhibit the synthesis of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and anticoagulant proteins C and S. This results in decreased prothrombin levels and decreases in the amount of thrombin generated and bound to fibrin. This reduces the thrombogenicity of clots.  
  
**Doses:** 5 mg daily for healthy individuals.  
2.5 mg daily for individuals with concomitant factors.  
  
**Absorption:  
**Completely absorbed after oral administration, with peak concentration generally attained within the first 4 hours.  
An anticoagulation effect generally occurs within 24 hours after warfarin administration. However, peak anticoagulant effect may be delayed 72 to 96 hours.  
  
**Metabolism:** CYP2C9 hepatic.  
99% bound to plasma proteins (albumin).  
  
**T1/2:** 25–60 hours (mean 40 hours). It takes 3-7 days for the INR to normalize depending on the dose, age, drug interactions and cardiac function.  
  
Enzyme induction of hepatic enzymes including CYP2C9 can increase metabolic clearance.  
  
**Protein bound:** 99% (albumin).  
**Excretion:** Minimally active metabolites excreted mainly in urine and lesser extent in bile.  
  
**Warfarin and Vitamin K Dependent Factors and Correlation  
**The INR can drop or approach normal levels 1–3 days following warfarin discontinuation. This reflects the increase of factor VII activity.  
However, inadequate hemostasis remains possible despite a decreased INR because factors-II has a longer _T_ 1/2 still <40% activity.  
  
Therefore, adequate levels of II, VII, IX, and X (≥40% activity) should be present reflecting adequate INR within reference limits.  
  
**Elimination half-lives of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors/proteins**  
(literature varies)  
Factor II – 42-60 hours.  
Factor VII - 4 to 6 hours.  
Factor IX – 21 to 30 hours.  
Factor X – 27-48.  
Proteins C- 8 hours.  
Protein S - 60 hours.  
  
**Warfarin and Neuraxial or Deep Regional Block**

| 5 days and when INR is within normal limits.  
If initial dose was given more than 24 hours prior to surgery:  
Check INR | Low dose:  
Yes, when INR is < 3.0.  
When INR > 3,  
hold or reduce dosage. | No delay if INR is < 3.0  
When INR > 3, hold or reduce dosage  
with indwelling catheters. | No delay. |

**Restart medication after procedure:** No recommendation. But maintain INR  
< 1.5 if an indwelling catheter is still in place.  
**Remove catheter after administration:** When INR < 1.5  
With an INR >1.5 but < 3, use caution when removing indwelling catheters.  
  
Always review medication records for concomitant therapy that influences hemostasis without affecting INR (NSAIDs, heparin). Neurologic assessment of sensory and motor function should be monitored.  
  
**Catheter manipulation:** Only manipulate any deep catheter when INR < 1.5  
  
**Warfarin Associated with Major Bleed**

Risk for allergic reaction and infection.  
Additional 5-10mg of Vitamin K IV slow infusion. |

  
**Disadvantages of Warfarin**  
Delayed optimal anticoagulant effect  
Has no effect on available clotting factors.  
No anticoagulant effect until these decay  
5-7 days until clotting factors are at a minimal level  
Warfarin half-life of 36 to 48 hours  
Persistent anticoagulant effect after warfarin is discontinued  
  
**Warfarin has a narrow therapeutic index drug (NTI).**  
When the INR falls below 2.0 thrombosis risk increases and when the INR rises above 4.0 serious bleeding risk increases.  
  
**Target INR ranges:  
Disease** **INR Range**  
DVT/PE 2.0-3.0  
Atrial Fibrillation 2.0-3.0  
Myocardial Infarction 2.0-3.0  
Mechanical Heart Valves 2.5-3.5  
  
**More Notes  
**Vitamin K usually corrects a Vitamin K dependent coagulopathy in 6 - 12 hours.  
  
If PT is less than twice normal, it may be safer to operate than to risk the thrombosis that the patient has been placed on coumarin to prevent.  
  
For emergency surgery, or when vitamin K is contraindicated (e.g. artificial valvular prosthesis) administer 25–50 U/kg four-factor PCC then check PT.  
  
**Fresh frozen plasma produces suboptimal anticoagulation reversal and should only be used if PCC is not available**  
  
**Anticoagulation reversal for non-major bleeding should be with 1–3 mg intravenous vitamin K.**  
  
For surgery that requires reversal of warfarin and that can be delayed 6–12 h, the INR can be corrected by giving intravenous vitamin K. For surgery that requires reversal of warfarin and which cannot be delayed for vitamin K to have time to take effect, the INR can be corrected by giving PCC and intravenous vitamin K. PCC should not be used to enable elective or non-urgent surgery.
