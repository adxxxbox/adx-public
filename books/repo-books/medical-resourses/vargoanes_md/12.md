### Let the lungs down (deflate) while chest saw is being used

With incision, give more fentanyl because opening the chest is very stimulating. In case you missed the skin incision, the loud noise of the surgeon testing the sternotomy saw will alert you. Immediately disconnect the patient from the ventilator or just turn off the ventilator and open APL valve-until the saw stops cutting. You don’t want expanded lungs while he is cutting. Some just disconnect the inspiratory tubing from the ventilator. DON’T FORGET TO RECONNECT THE VENTILATOR WHEN SAW IS TURNED OFF!
