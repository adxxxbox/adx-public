Myringotomy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Myringotomy

A tiny incision is made in the tympanic membrane. Any fluid, usually thickened secretions will be removed. In most situations, a tympanostomy tube is inserted to keep the middle ear aerated for a prolonged period of time. These ventilating tubes will eventually fall out.  
**Common Diagnosis**: Chronic Otitis media  
Anesthetic: General for Peds and uncooperative adults.  
Peds with NO IV: Mask induction/ventilation with 8% Sevoflurane.  
Anesthetic topical eardrops are for cooperative adults.  
Positioning: Supine, head turned away from surgeon.

**Duration**: 5-15 minutes.  
IV Access: If it’s a child, we usually don’t insert one, but have an IV set up on stand-by.  
EBL: Minimal  

**Procedure Notes**:  
For pediatrics, these myringotomy or BMT or Bilateral myringotomy Tubes cases are usually stacked, multiple cases, requiring fast turnovers. So arrive early and have all your back up airway equipment and emergency meds readily available.  
These are fast cases so pre-chart as much information as you can in the pre-op.  
Mask induce with 8% Sevo. Some CRNAs still use 7:3 (N2O/O2) along with Sevo. Once the patient is adequately anesthetized, you can titrate the Sevo down to 2%.  
Don’t turn the kid’s head away from the MD until you are ready or the surgeon might  
proceed without you! It is easier to assist ventilation than to forcefully, manually ventilate the patient. The biggest challenge is to simultaneously hold the child’s head motionless while you chart.  
The MD will likely do the right ear first, so turn the child’s head away from the surgeon.  
When the MD puts drops in the right ear, turn the Sevoflurane down to 1% and turn the child’s head to the right. The surgeon will walk around the table and proceed with the left ear. When the surgeon puts drops in the left ear, turn the Sevoflurane off and try to get the patient to recovery room safely before he/she wakes up.
