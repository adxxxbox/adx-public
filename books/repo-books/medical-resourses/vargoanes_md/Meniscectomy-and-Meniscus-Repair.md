### Meniscectomy and Meniscus Repair

  
Usually part of an orthopedic arthroscopic procedure. Half the time you are not aware the procedure was performed until the surgeon states it was done at the end of the case.

**  
Meniscectomy and Meniscus Repair**: Is the surgical removal or repair of either of two C-shaped bands of cartilage in the knee joint. The meniscus forms a buffer between the leg bones (the tibia, fibula, and femur); it serves as a shock absorber; it assists in lubrication of the joint; and it also limits the joint's flexion, extension, and rotation.
