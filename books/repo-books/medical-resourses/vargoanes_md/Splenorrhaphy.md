Splenorrhaphy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Splenorrhaphy

**Definition:** “Suturing a ruptured spleen.”

The surgical repair of a traumatized spleen rather than removing the entire organ by splenectomy. There is usually more blood lost trying to repair it.

If a blood transfusion becomes a necessary adjunct for successful splenorrhaphy, then splenectomy without transfusion is the safer treatment.
