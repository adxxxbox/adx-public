### Urgent warfarin reversal for a mild bleed

Stop warfarin.  
If procedure can be delayed 6-24 hours, administer vitamin K 1.25-10mg PO or low-dose vitamin K 1-2mg IV.  
  
**Higher doses of vitamin K.**  
5-10 mg IV may be needed depending on initial INR results and post-reversal INR which is checked 24 hours after dose.  
  
Higher doses of vitamin K may increase need to and duration of bridging therapy (e.g. enoxaparin, IV heparin) if warfarin is to be restarted.  
  
Consider 1-2 units of FFP for INR greater than 4.9.  
  
Repeat every 6-12 hours until 2 successive INR results are at desired target.  
  
Consult cardiology if patient has mechanical heart valve (high risk of thrombosis).
