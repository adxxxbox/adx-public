# Potassium Chloride

**Potassium Chloride (KCl)**  
**Class:** Electrolyte  
**Serum Potassium** (3.5-5.0 meq/L)  
**Anesthesia concern with KCl levels:** Arrhythmias  
**Serum Potassium** **3.5 - 5.0** mEq/L (We tend to run levels higher)  
**Doses:**  
10-20 mEq IV over 30 minutes  
**Max:** 200 mEq/day  
**Peds:** 0.5-1 mEq/kg/dose  
**Peds Max:** 1mEq/kg/hr  
**Do Not Infuse Rapidly**  
**Caution With Renal Patients**  
With renal insufficiency, administration of KCl may cause potassium intoxication and life-threatening hyperkalemia.  
**Hyperkalemia - Possible Causes:** Cardioplegia  
Metabolic Acidosis/hypoventilation.  
PRBC administration  
**Hypokalemia Possible Causes:**  
Lasix  
Beta-adrenergic stimuli enhances potassium entry into cells.  
Alkalosis/hypeventilation.  
The serum potassium level is difficult to replenish if the serum magnesium level is also low. Look to replace both.  
**Hypokalemia Treatment**  
Give 10-20 mEq of Kcl through the central live (do not bolus).  
**Hyperkalemia Treatment**  
Treat if serum K > 6 or in the presence of EKG changes.  
1 gram CaCl  
Or  
Lasix 10-20 mg  
Or  
10 units Humilin R insulin with 1 amp of D50W.  
  
Albuterol Treatments can be added. They also decrease K but just transiently.  
There was a study that showed that a glucose - potassium insulin infusion may improve cardiac function both with patients with and without diabetes by providing an energy substrate.  
  
**CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY**  
Potassium is the chief cation of body cells and is concerned with the maintenance of body fluid composition and electrolyte balance.  
Potassium participates in carbohydrate utilization and protein synthesis, and is critical in the regulation of nerve conduction and muscle contraction, particularly in the heart.  
Chloride, the major extracellular anion, closely follows the metabolism of sodium, and changes in the acid-base of the body are reflected by changes in the chloride concentration.  
Normally about 80 to 90% of the potassium intake is excreted in the urine, the remainder in the stools and to a small extent, in the perspiration. The kidney does not conserve potassium well so that during fasting, or in patients on a potassium free diet, potassium loss from the body continues resulting in potassium depletion. A deficiency of either potassium or chloride will lead to a deficit of the other.
