### Aspiration Risks with Pregnancy

Almost 50% of airway deaths in GA for Cesarean section were due to pulmonary aspiration.  
Prior to 1990, the most common cause of anesthesia related maternal death was aspiration. Due to the aggressive aspiration prophylaxis we use today, this value is declining.  
  
**Maternal mortality of aspiration has drastically decreased over the past 3 decades to negligible levels from the following:  
**Greater use of neuraxial anesthesia.  
Prophylactic administration of Reglan, Pepcid and Bicitra.  
RSI with general anesthesia  
NPO policies  
Improved training of anesthesia providers  
  
**Statistics**(Olsson et al)  
1 in 2,131 overall incidences of aspiration undergoing anesthesia  
1 in 661 with C-sections  
It has been noted that obesity is a significant risk factor.  
**Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES) and Reflux  
**The gravid uterus may encroach on the stomach, increase intragastric pressure and decrease the effectiveness of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES).  
Literature also states that an increased level of progesterone relaxes the LES smooth muscle permitting reflux.  
**Mendelson's Syndrome:**  
Acid aspiration leading to an inflammatory response of the lung parenchyma causing a chemical pneumonia. This is also declining.  
Increased rate of difficult airway and increased risks of aspiration is why regional anesthesia is highly preferred for C-sections.  
The safest and most effective way of aspiration prophylaxis is utilizing regional anesthesia.  
**Aspiration Prophylaxis Starts at 16 Weeks Gestation**  
After 16 weeks gestational age, Pepcid and Bicitra for premedication should be considered. Histamine H2-receptor antagonists (Pepcid) in combination with sodium citrate (Bicitra) increase the mean pH and decrease the percentage of patients with a gastric pH <2.5 required to cause a chemical pneumonitis. This decreases the prevalence of Mendelson's Syndrome.
