### Prilocaine

**Prilocaine (Citanest, Prilocanium)**  
Amide-type local anesthetic  
**pKa:** 7.9  
  
**Nonionized:** 24% at pH 7.40 (76% ionized)  
  
**Relative Potency (CNS toxicity):** 1.2 out of 4  
  
Mostly used in dental for infiltration.  
Lidocaine and Prilocaine are mixed to create EMLA.  
Has a similar clinical profile to lidocaine and its use for infiltration, peripheral nerve blocks and spinal and epidural anesthesia is similar.  
Higher doses may result in methemoglobinemia-major deterrent.  
Has a high clearance with the lowest systemic toxicity rate of all the amide local anesthetics.  
Potentially useful for IV regional anesthesia.  
  
**Possible drug interactions:** Effects may be increased when the patient is on dapsone (anti-mycobacterial agent).

Epinephrine does not significantly affect the peak plasma levels of prilocaine or bupivacaine.

**Methemoglobinemia and prilocaine**  
Higher doses of > 500-600 mg or (8mg/kg) may result in methemoglobinemia but does not have significant consequences in healthy patients.  
Treat methemoglobinemia with 1-2mg/kg of methylene blue over 5 minutes.  
The risk of methemoglobinemia limits FDA approval for wider use.  
An effect of metabolism of the aromatic ring to o-toluidine increases its propensity to cause methemoglobinemia.  
  
**Symptoms of methemoglobinemia  
**Patient exhibits a cyanotic appearance that does not respond to the administration of 100% oxygen.  
When methemoglobin levels are low, cyanosis can become apparent, but symptoms of nausea, sedation, seizures, and even coma may result when levels are very high (Wilburn-Goo, 1999).  
The clinical sign of cyanosis is observed as blood concentrations of methemoglobin reach 10% to 20%, whereas dyspnea and tachycardia emerge as methemoglobinemia concentrations reach 35% to 40%.  
Most reports of methemoglobinemia with prilocaine and benzocaine are associated with excessive doses (Moore, 1999).  
  
**Metabolism:** Liver  
**Protein bound** : 50%  
**Renal excretion:** < 3%  
**Plasma half-life:** 1-2 hours  
  
**Contraindications:  
**Hypersensitivity  
Methemoglobinemia  
AnemiaPrilocaine is rarely used in peripheral nerve blocks.
