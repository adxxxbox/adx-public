Sleep Apnea Notes (Apnea of Prematurity)   

### Sleep Apnea Notes (Apnea of Prematurity)

Lasts 20 seconds and results in bradycardia and cyanosis

Surgery will make this problem worse due to metabolic and pharmacologic problems

Greatest risk is premature infants with PCA (post conceptional age) of less than 44 weeks, children less than 60 wks PCA are hospitalized after surgery

Postpone elective surgery if possible

Titrate opioids carefully

Use regional if possible

Combine the immature respiratory neuro control with the respiratory type II muscles (easily fatigued) , this may be responsible for much of the post op apnea- especially with the preterm infants with gestational age <44weeks.

Prematurely born infants <44 weeks post conception, especially those with a history of apnea, are at high risk (20-40%) of developing post op apnea.

Caffeine and theophylline reduce apnea, strengthen muscle contractility, strengthen muscle contractility, prevent fatigue, and are respiratory stimulants.
