### Epidural Dosing for Height and Age

**Epidural Dosing and Height**  
The shorter the patient, the less local anesthetic volume required.  
  
A patient who is only 5’3” may require 1 ml per dermatome while someone who is 6’3” may require the full 2 ml per dermatome  
  
Some anesthesia providers dose the same volume regardless of height and assess the patient after incremental doses.  
  
**Epidural Dosing with Age**  
As age increases the amount of local anesthetic to achieve the same level of anesthesia DECREASES.  
  
A 20-year-old is not the same as an 80-year-old. This is due to changes in the size and compliance of the epidural space.
