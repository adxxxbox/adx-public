Ruptured Ectopic Pregnancy    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Ruptured Ectopic Pregnancy

Ectopic refers to “out of place.”  
Intrauterine pregnancy: IUP  
Intrauterine device: IUD  
Ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized ovum implants outside of the uterine cavity.  
  
_These may result in an emergency surgical procedure because a ruptured ectopic pregnancy can result in life-threatening intraperitoneal hemorrhage.  
_  
Refer to “Ectopic Pregnancy” and “Ectopic Pregnancy Ruptured” in Case Tips of the Mega App for anesthesia and surgical concerns.  
**Subtypes of ectopic pregnancy (by location):  
Tubal:** Most common (96%) any portion of the fallopian tube  
55–80% in the ampulla  
12–25% in the isthmus  
5–17% in the fimbriae

**Abdominal (intra-abdominally):** Usually after tubal abortion or rupture of tubal ectopic pregnancy.  
**Heterotopic:** Implanted intrauterine and a separate pregnancy implanted outside uterine cavity**Ovarian** : Implantation of pregnancy in ovarian tissue**Cervical:** Within the cervix**Intraligamentary:** Within the broad ligament  
**  
Ectopic pregnancy in the ampulla of the fallopian tube:  
**Eventually the fetal growth runs out of space.  
Slowly the ectopic pregnancy stretches the nerve fibers within the wall of the fallopian tube, resulting in lower abdominal pain.  
Eventually, the expansion causes damage to the wall of the ampulla, potentially rupturing  
the fallopian tube.  
As mentioned above, a ruptured ectopic can also lead to massive hemorrhaging into the abdominal cavity.  
The blood can irritate the peritoneum which can cause referred pain to the shoulder.  
**  
Statistics and facts:**  
US prevalence is estimated to be 1% to 2%, but this may be an underestimate because this condition is often treated in the office.  
33% recurrence rate if there was a prior ectopic pregnancy  
Mortality rate has steadily declined over the past three decades.  
Accounted for 2.7% of pregnancy related deaths in 2011 to 2013.  
Frequently associated with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which may lead to stenosis of the fallopian tubes.  
  
**Risk factors:**  
PID (may cause fallopian tube stenosis)  
Endometritis  
A ciliary motility disorder of the fallopian tubes (e.g., endometriosis, Kartagener).  
Current gonorrhea/chlamydia infection  
Conception by in-vitro fertilization  
Previous ectopic pregnancy  
History of tubal ligation (~33% of pregnancies after tubal ligation are ectopic)  
Previous gynecologic surgery  
Previous ectopic pregnancy  
Tobacco use  
  
**Ectopic pregnancy and IUD:**  
Ectopic pregnancy occurs in about 1% of patients using an implanted IUD.  
This is below the national average.  
However, in the rare case that a woman does become pregnant while she has an IUD, the prevalence of ectopic pregnancy is as high as 53%.  
There is no difference in ectopic pregnancy rates between copper or progestin-releasing IUDs.  
  
**Possible symptoms and presentation:  
**Amenorrhea, or a missed menstrual period  
Pelvic pain  
Abdominal tenderness with or without rebound tenderness from peritoneal irritation.  
Shoulder pain: Referred pain from the perineum.  
Vaginal bleeding  
Palpable mass on pelvic exam  
Cervical motion tenderness  
In cervical cases, an hourglass-shaped cervix may be seen.  
  
**Ruptured:**  
With a rupture, there will be signs of significant intraperitoneal bleeding.  
Signs of shock such as pallor, tachycardia, and hypotension may be present.  
  
**Differential diagnosis:  
**Missed abortion (miscarriage)Molar pregnancyAcute appendicitisSalpingitis  
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)Ruptured corpus luteum or hemorrhagic cyst  
Ovarian tumor or torsion  
Cervical polyp  
Cancer  
Trauma  
Cervicitis  
  
_Early detection and treatment of ectopic pregnancy is key to avoiding morbidity and mortality._**  
  
Diagnosis:  
**The pregnancy must first be confirmed via Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (B-hCG) test  
**  
Serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels:**  
Serum hCG have a 99% accuracy rate for pregnancy.  
An increase in serum hCG of less than 53% in 48 hours in early pregnancy (when serum hCG is less than 2,000) confirms an abnormal pregnancy.  
**Note:** With pregnancy, serum hCG levels normally increase by at least 53% every 48 hours.  
  
**hCG discriminatory level: (>1,500 to 2,000 IU/L):**  
A serum hCG above the discriminatory level suggests an abnormal pregnancy of unknown location (PUL).  
**Note:** A serum hCG level of 3,500 IU/L is associated with a 99% probability of detecting a normal intrauterine gestational sac in clinical practice.  
However, serum hCG levels above the discriminatory zone should be used with caution; serial ultrasound is more useful in this group.  
  
**Serum progesterone level:**  
A serum progesterone <5ng/ml has a specificity of 100% for an abnormal pregnancy.  
\>20 ng/ml typically indicates a normal intrauterine pregnancy.  
  
**Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS):** The gold standard  
A TVUS is used to determine location and fetal heartbeat.  
Transvaginal US (TVUS) is used to identify and locate the gestational sac (yolk sac, fetal pole)  
in the adnexa or have findings suspicious for an ectopic, such as pelvic free fluid or a complex adnexal mass.  
**Note:** Both an ectopic pregnancy and corpus luteum are vascular structures that can present as a “ring of fire” in the adnexa.**  
TVUS notes:  
**A gestational sac is TYPICALLY seen by 24 days after conception (5+3 weeks)  
A yolk sac by 5+5 weeks  
Fetal pole by 6 weeks on TVUS.  
**  
Normal hCG and negative TVUS with suspecting ectopic pregnancy:  
**Serial serum hCG levels and transvaginal ultrasonography (TVU) should be performed until a symptomatic early pregnancy can be determined to be a viable IUP, non‐viable IUP or ectopic pregnancy.  
If the beta-hCG level is below the discriminatory zone and TUVS is unremarkable, patients may have an early intrauterine pregnancy or an ectopic pregnancy.  
Serial hCG levels are drawn.  
As mentioned earlier, serum hCG levels normally increase by at least 53% every 48 hours._  
Impression of acute abdomen and/or intraperitoneal bleeding concurrent with a positive hCG level is indicative of ectopic pregnancy until proven otherwise.  
__This is considered a medical emergency._  
**Treatment:**  
**If the patient is hemodynamically stable and has no signs of bleeding:**  
Administration of IM methotrexate (MTX)  
The overall success rate of IM MTX in properly selected patients is nearly 90 percent.  
  
**MTX is indicated for:  
**Unruptured tubal pregnancies are < 3 cm in diameter.  
No fetal heart activity is detected.  
The beta-hCG level is < 5,000 mIU/ml (milli-international units per ml) ideally, but up to 15,000 mIU/ml.  
  
**MTX mechanism of action:** Inhibits DNA synthesis via folic acid antagonism by inactivating dihydrofolate reductase.  
This stops fetal or embryonic cell division (growth) and ends the pregnancy.  
The pregnancy then is absorbed by the body over 4–6 weeks.  
The goal is not to require surgery and/or removal of a fallopian tube.  
  
**Standard IM methotrexate single dose:** (50 mg/m2)  
Note: Rupture of ectopic pregnancy during MTX treatment ranges from 7% to 14%.  
  
**A standard MTX dosing protocol:  
**_Always refer to your institution protocol.  
_Single-dose regimen  
Two-dose regimen  
Multi-dose regimen  
**  
Single dose regimen:**  
**Day 1:** MTX 50mg/m2 intramuscular injection  
**Day 4 & Day 7:** Measure hCG level, a rise may be seen on Day 4 compared to baseline day 1.  
**If hCG has a ≥15% drop from Day 4 to Day 7:**  
Continue to follow weekly until hCG <5 mIU/ml.  
**  
If hCG has a <15% drop from Day 4 to Day 7:**  
Repeat MTX 50mg/m2 and repeat serum hCG Day 4 & 7  
  
**Two‐dose regimen of TXA:**  
**Day 1:** MTX 50mg/m2 IM injection  
**Day 4** : MTX 50mg/m2 IM injection and serum hCG level  
**Day 7:** Check serum hCG level  
**  
If hCG has a ≥15% drop from Day 4 to Day 7:**  
Continue to follow weekly until hCG <5 mIU/ml  
**  
If hCG has <15% drop from Day 4 to Day 7:  
**Repeat MTX 50mg/m2 and check hCG on day 11.  
**  
If hCG has a ≥15% drop from Day 7 to Day 11:**  
Continue to follow weekly until hCG <5 mIU/ml  
**  
If hCG has a <15% drop from Day 7 to Day 11:**  
Repeat MTX 50mg/m2 and check hCG on day 14.  
  
**If hCG has ≥15% drop from Day 11 to Day 14:**  
Continue to follow weekly until hCG <5 mIU/ml.  
**  
Multi dose regimen:  
**MTX 1mg/kg IM Days 1, 3, 5, 7.  
Alternate with folinic acid 0.1mg/kg IM days 2, 4, 6, 8.Measure serum hCG on MTX dose days; continue dosing until hCG decreases 15% from previous measurement.Follow hCG levels until <5 mIU/ml**  
  
Dosing notes and facts:  
**There is presently no study that compares single-dose and two-dose regimens head-to-head.  
**A Two-dose regimen** should be considered if medical management is planned despite relative contraindications (eg. hCG >5000 mIU/ml, + ectopic cardiac activity).  
**Multi-dose regimen** should be reserved for extreme cases (e.g. cervical ectopic, hCG>10,000 in poor surgical candidate); other interventions such as an u/s‐guided KCl injection should also be considered.  
**  
Other treatment guidelines:  
**RhoGAM if Rh negativeAdvise patient to discontinue folic acid supplementation during MTX treatmentAvoid pelvic exams and pelvic intercourse during treatmentCaution patients re: GI side‐effects, to avoid alcohol and NSAIDs, and sun‐sensitivityAvoid new conception until serum hCG is undetectable  
  
**Signs and symptoms of ruptures ectopic pregnancy:  
**Sudden and severe lower abdominal pain (acute abdomen)  
Signs of hemorrhagic shock (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension, syncope)  
Tachycardia  
  
**Hemorrhage may also lead to bradycardia.**  
The theory is that the activation of mechanoreceptors in the left ventricle triggers a vagally mediated reflex.  
Another suggested cause for bradycardia is a vagally mediated parasympathetic reflex that is activated by blood in the peritoneum.  
**  
Surgical treatment:  
**Exploratory laparoscopy is the first line surgical management.  
  
**Common surgical procedures:  
**Salpingectomy  
Partial Salpingectomy

**Laparoscopic salpingectomy** **(fallopian tube removal) is indicated for:**  
Uncontrolled bleeding  
Recurrent ectopic pregnancy  
Severely damaged fallopian tube  
Large gestational sac  
Patients desire for sterilization  
  
**Possible complications:  
**Hemorrhage  
Ureteral injury/stenosis  
Post-op shoulder and chest pain from unabsorbed gas peritoneal irritation  
Post-op infection  
Thrombophlebitis
