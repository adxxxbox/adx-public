### Cauda Equina Syndrome

(more common with spinals)  
_Daniel D. Moos CRNA_

Cauda equina syndrome is a relatively rare but serious condition that describes compression of nerves in the lumbar spine (cauda equina) and a narrowing of the spinal canal.  
  
If patients with cauda equina syndrome do not seek immediate treatment to relieve the pressure, it can result in permanent paralysis, impaired bladder and/or bowel control, loss of sexual sensation, and other problems. Even with immediate treatment, some patients may not recover complete function.  
  
**Common causes of Cauda Equina Syndrome  
**A severe ruptured disk in the lumbar area (the most common cause)Narrowing of the spinal canal (stenosis)A spinal lesion or malignant tumorA spinal infection, inflammation, hemorrhage, or fractureA-V malformation  
  
**Symptoms of Cauda Equina Syndrome**  
It may be hard to diagnose cauda equina syndrome. Symptoms vary and may come on slowly.  
Paraplegia  
Weakness of urinary and fecal sphincters  
Severe low back pain  
Pain, numbness, or weakness in one or both legs  
Urine retention or incontinence.  
Sexual dysfunction  
  
**Diagnosis**  
MRI or Myelogram  
  
Cauda Equina syndrome can be caused by anything that interferes with the functioning of the cauda equina. The most common cause is herniation of the nucleus pulposus in lower lumbar regions directly backwards; another is metastasis.  
  
**Intrathecal Med Errors  
**Nerve roots (especially the sacral) within the subarachnoid space are highly vulnerable to chemical damage. Intrathecal potassium can kill.  
  
**Irritant solutions may cause neurotoxicity  
**Irritant solutions may cause neurotoxicity and arachnoiditis. Neurotoxicity may manifest as cauda equina syndrome.  
  
**More Notes  
**Cauda equina syndrome has been associated with continuous spinal catheter techniques and 5% lidocaine. Cauda equina syndrome is permanent and associated with sphincter dysfunction, sensory/motor deficits, and paresis. Sensory deficits generally occur in a peripheral nerve pattern due to the maldistribution of hyperbaric lidocaine and subsequent neurotoxicity.  
**Concerning neurotoxicity of local anesthetics:** lidocaine = tetracaine > bupivacaine > ropivacaine. The patient will experience pain similar to nerve root compression. Cauda equina syndrome has been reported after single shot spinal anesthetics as well as spinal catheter techniques. Cauda equina syndrome can rarely occur after epidural anesthesia.
