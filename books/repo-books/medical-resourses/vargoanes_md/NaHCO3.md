### NaHCO3 - Adjuvant to Neuraxial Anesthesia

**Doses of NaHCO3  
Epidural  
**2 mEq of NaHCO3 may be added to either 2% plain Lidocaine (no epi) or 3% Chloroprocaine for urgent C-sections for patients with a previously placed epidural.  
  
**Rule of thumb  
**One (1) mEq of bicarbonate is added to every 10 ml of local anesthetic.  
  
**Bicarbonate** 8.4% (1 mEq/ml in 50 ml prefilled syringe).  
  
**Spinals:** N/AIn OB Regional Anesthesia, NaHCO3 is indicated for reducing the latency (onset) of the local anesthetic per epidural for urgent C-sections. The reduction of latency varies from 1.5 minutes to 10 minutes. Literature varies.  
  
Realistically, it is rarely administered because we waste precious time retrieving, drawing it up, and mixing it with the local anesthetic. It is easier for us to immediately go to the patient’s labor room and start administering 2% plain Lidocaine or 3% Chloroprocaine.  
  
**Sodium Bicarbonate  
**Every Obstetric Anesthesia book tells you over and over that 2 mEq of NaHCO3  
added to 20mLs of 3% Chloroprocaine is the fastest acting epidural cocktail for emergency C-sections. That is probably true, but we rarely waste our time drawing NaHCO3 up for the above reason.  
  
**Benefits of adding Sodium Bicarbonate**  
Increases the amount of free base (non-ionized form of local anesthetic)  
Speeds onset  
Improve quality of the block  
Prolongs the duration of blockade  
Decreased pain associated with subcutaneous infiltration  
  
**Method of Action**  
As you know, local anesthetics are weak bases with a pKa higher than physiologic pH. The addition of bicarb increases the unionized form (free base) of the local anesthetic that is available to penetrate the nerve membrane. This accelerates the onset of the block and decreases the minimum concentration required for a conduction blockade.  
  
**Example  
**Lidocaine exists as a weak base.  
In solution there is equilibrium between the ionized and unionized fraction, which is dependent on the pka and the pH of the solution.  
Only the unionized form is lipid soluble and can easily diffuse across the lipid phase of the neural membrane.  
The more alkaline the solution, the greater the unionized fraction of lidocaine.  
The addition of bicarb to lidocaine increases the pH, thereby increasing the unionized fraction.  
This allows a greater proportion of local anesthetic to diffuse across the neural membrane. There is a limit to the amount of sodium bicarbonate that can be added to local anesthetics, because high pH causes precipitation.  
There are actually guidelines for adding sodium bicarbonate to the various local anesthetics.  
As stated at the top of the page, the rule of thumb is One (1) mEq of bicarbonate is added to every 10 ml of local anesthetic.
