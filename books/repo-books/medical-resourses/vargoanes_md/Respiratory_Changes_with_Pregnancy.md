### Respiratory Changes with Pregnancy

Dyspnea is a common complaint in pregnancy affecting over half of women at some stage.Minute Ventilation ↑ 45%  
Alveolar Ventilation↑ 70%  
Tidal Volume ↑ 45%  
Total O2 Consumption ↑ 20%  
RR ↑ 10%  
FRC ↓ 20%

Lung Volumes between pregnant and nonpregnant women

**Pre oxygenation with RSI**  
Pre oxygenation is essential due to rapid de-saturation owing to an increased O2 consumption and a reduction in _FRC._**  
  
Intubating a full term patient may be more difficult due to:**  
Increased breast size  
Increased airway mucosal edema (especially with preeclampsia)An ETT one size smaller is recommended (6.5-7.0 mm).  
Avoid nasal intubations due to vascular engorgement.  
Mallampati scores increase one grade higher in 33% of women after labor.  
In pregnant women, the internal diameter of the trachea is reduced due to the mucosal capillary engorgement.A preeclamptic patient may have worsened pharyngeal and subglottic edema.  
  
**Mean Airway Pressures May Be Increased**Reduced compliance necessitating higher airway pressures to maintain adequate ventilation.  
  
**O2 Requirements and CO2 Production**  
O2 requirements and the production of CO2 increase 60% during pregnancy to meet the elevated metabolic demands of mother and fetus. The body safely adjusts for these changes.  
There is an increase in tidal volume and thus minute ventilation by up to 45% by the second trimester to meet the above demands.  
  
**Hyperventilation** Hyperventilation occurs which is due both to an increase in tidal volume (40%) and a lesser increase in respiratory rate (10-15%).  
This results in slight decrease in PaCO2 (32mmHg) resulting in a mild respiratory alkalosis (pH 7.44).  
The increase in progesterone is the main hormone responsible for the increase in tidal volume and thus minute ventilation. Progesterone decreases the CO2 response threshold of the respiratory center, which enables the mother to blow off the increased CO2 and handle the increased O2 consumption. As mentioned earlier, progesterone functions to relax bronchiolar smooth muscle.  
  
**FRC Reduction  
**As the uterus becomes larger, it pushes the diaphragm more cephalad decreasing the functional residual capacity (FRC) by 20% in the upright position and up to 30% in the supine position. This is one reason why preoxygentaion prior to induction is required to prevent rapid desaturation/decreased SaO2.
