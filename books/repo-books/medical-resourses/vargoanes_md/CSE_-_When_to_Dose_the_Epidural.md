### CSE - When to Dose the Epidural

  
CSE:(Combined Spinal Epidural)

**When to Dose the Epidural Catheter after you have administered the spinal dose  
**When placing a CSE, one should not dose the catheter with a large bolus of local anesthetic soon afterwards (less than five minutes), as a high spinal may result.  
The reason for this is not from the diffusion of the local anesthetic through the dural puncture hole created by the spinal needle, as some believed previously, but simply because a large bolus increases the pressure in the epidural space, and that pressure is transmitted to the subarachnoid space, pushing up the level.  
It should not be necessary to dose an epidural catheter at all after CSE, assuming the appropriate spinal dose has been administered.  
Also note that the incidence of intrathecal placement or migration of an epidural catheter is not increased in CSE.  
Studies have shown that the catheter doesn’t work its’ way through the tiny “dural rent” (puncture hole) of the CSE.
