Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH)   

### Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH)

Often a life threatening occurrence; occurs every 1: 2,000-3,000 births, depending on your reference source.  
Described by Bochdalek in 1848.

Around 90% are posterolateral in location.  
Around 80% are left sided.  
2% occur with familial association.  
Around 40% have associated congenital anomalies.

80-90% herniate through the left posterior diaphragm via the foramen of Bochdalek. This is called a Foramen of Bochdalek Hernia.  
  
Hernias through the foramen of Bochdalek that occur early in fetal life usually cause respiratory failure immediately after birth because of pulmonary hypoplasia.  
  
CDHs patients are mostly male; most are born full term and over 3Kg.  
  
The complete closure of the diaphragm occurs at 10-12 weeks gestation. If the diaphragm is incompletely formed, the bowel follows the path of least resistance and enters the thorax. The bowel compresses the affected lung and inhibits full lung development, resulting in pulmonary hypoplasia. A mediastinal shift to the contralateral side could happen, causing compression to the other lung.  
  
**At Birth:**  
Avoid distension of the stomach by bag mask ventilation.  
Pass an orogastric tube (OGT) or nasogastric tube (NGT) to decompress the intestines occupying the chest.  
  
**Signs and Symptoms:**  
Respiratory distress and cyanosis in the first minutes or hours of life.

Scaphoid abdomen.

Barrel-shaped chest.

Respiratory distress (retractions, cyanosis, grunting respirations)

In left-sided posterolateral hernia: Poor air entry on the left with a shift of cardiac sounds over the right chest. In patients with severe defects, signs of pneumothorax (poor air entry, poor perfusion) may also be found.

Associated anomalies: Dysmorphisms such as craniofacial abnormalities, extremity abnormalities, or spinal dysraphism may suggest syndromic congenital diaphragmatic hernia.

Most of these patients have pulmonary hypertension (PHT). If the PHT is not controlled, everything just gets worse. It could cause shunting of blood from right to left through the ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale, known as persistent fetal circulation. We know that persistent fetal circulation (PFC) exacerbates hypoxia, hypercarbia and causes metabolic acidosis.

**Early Diagnosis:  
**Today routine ultrasound scans of pregnant women in the second trimester (around 24 weeks) have increased the early detection rate of CDH.  

**Note:** Studies of the administration of prenatal steroids to improve development of the aplastic lung have been inconclusive.

After diagnosis is made, the mother will be requested to make plans to deliver at the closest tertiary hospital that can care for neonates with diaphragmatic hernias. Most of these neonates are delivered close to or at full term and usually weigh > 3kg.

In the past, these neonates were immediately rushed to the operating room.

Today, these neonates are transferred to the NICU to be stabilized for surgery. The goal is to prevent PHT and barotrauma with all related complications at the same time.  
  
Gentle ventilation is attempted to decrease any barotrauma through High Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation (HFOV). If barotrauma occurs, requiring chest tubes, the neonate may sometimes be placed on ECMO (Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation).

If pulmonary hypertension (PHT) is severe, it may be treated with Inhaled Nitrous Oxide, or iNO.

**More Notes**  
**Prognosis for CDH is poor when:  
**Associated with cardiac deformities.  
Preoperative alveolar-to-arterial oxygen gradient is greater than 500 mm Hg.  
Severe hypercarbia exists despite aggressive ventilation.

  
Prognosis is correlated with pulmonary compliance and chest x-ray.

Ipsilateral lung growth, on the same side as the hernia, is further impaired at a later stage of gestation by mechanical compression induced by the presence of abdominal organs in the thoracic cavity. This interferes with fetal breathing movements and reduction in the secretion of fetal lung fluid.

**Pathophysiology:  
**The affected lung is abnormal at all stages of lung development. Lungs from fetuses and children with CDH have underdeveloped airways, abnormal differentiation of type II pneumocytes, and a reduced number of pulmonary arterioles per unit lung volume.

The intrapulmonary arteries become excessively muscularized during gestation. These pulmonary vessels display an abnormal response to vasoactive substances and this all can contribute to PHT.

**While in the NICU:**  
There have recently been great improvements in the survival rate of infants with CDH.

Ventilatory support is the most important aspect of the postnatal management of infants with CDH. The goal is to utilize methods for improving oxygenation while avoiding injury to the hypoplastic lung.

In the past, barotrauma occurred, usually multiple pneumothoraces, by aggressively hyperventilating the neonate to induce alkalosis in an attempt to reverse or eliminate right to left ductal shunting in infants with PHT.

Studies showed that pulmonary barotrauma and damage to the hypoplastic lung might have contributed to the high mortality rate.

Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is a gaseous pulmonary vasodilator that has been shown to improve oxygenation in infants with persistent PHT of the newborn. It may also improve the function of a failing right ventricle.

**Management of pulmonary vascular tone:  
**All infants with CDH have an abnormally high pulmonary vascular resistance. An echocardiogram should be done to estimate the severity of PHT.  
**  
Typical Echocardiogram with CHD associated with PHT:**  
Flattening of the intraventricular septum.  
Tricuspid regurgitation.  
Right-to-left or bidirectional shunt at the ductus arteriosus.  
  

**Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO)  
**ECMO has been used both as a rescue therapy in those with severe hypoxia after surgical repair and in the stabilization of infants before and during surgery. There are conflicting studies of the benefits of ECMO with CDH.  
The surgical repair of CDH can be done while the patient is on ECMO.  

**Surgical repair**  
Up until the 1980s, CDHs were immediately repaired after delivery. Despite the urgent repair, there were really NO improvement in gas exchange, and thoracic compliance and PaCO2 commonly deteriorated postoperatively.

Today, most centers now delay surgery for at least 24–48 hours after delivery in attempt to stabilize the neonate and decrease the pulmonary vascular resistance. Surgery may be delayed further if the PHT is not adequately controlled. However, there is still no evidence that timing of surgery affects outcome.

**CDH and Related Cardiac Anomalies occur up to 52% of the time.**  
Patent ductus arteriosus

Aortic arch hypoplasia

**Musculoskeletal anomalies occur up to 20% of the time.  
**Hypodactyly

**CNS Anomalies occur up to 11% of the time.**

Microcephaly  
Cerebral palsy  
  
**Genitourinary anomalies occur around 5% of the time.**  
Hypospadias  
Renal dysplasia
