Choledochal Cyst Anesthesia   

### Choledochal Cyst Anesthesia

Today, complete excision of the cyst and biliary bypass have become the treatment of choice. This procedure can be open or laparoscopic.

In either one, the surgical treatment is to completely excise the choledochal cysts followed by reconstruction of the biliary tree with hepaticojejunostomy in a Roux-en-Y fashion.

This is basically a long belly case.  
The anesthesia for this procedure is similar to a Kasai procedure.

**Labs:** CBC, T & C, Coags (PT, PTT), BUN, Cr, LFTs.**Is blood available?** PRBCs, FFP, parent donor?

Try to correct any coagulation issues before surgery.  
Is the liver compromised?

**Heat the room up:** This may be an open belly case and a large surface of the liver is often exposed to the cold operating room. A Fluid warmer and underbody warming blanket is recommended to maintain normothermia.

**Anesthesia:** General/ETT  
Epidural to supplement if coags are normal.  
**Induction:** Mask inhalation if no IV access.  
**Nitrous:** Avoid due to bowel distention.  
**Inhalation Agent:** Isoflurane is the gas of choice if the liver is compromised.  
**Position:** Supine  
**Duration:** 4-6 hours.  
**IV Access:** 22g x 2. May be a difficult IV stick due to previous attempts. 2 saphenous IVs or a central line is common.  
**Age range:** 1-4 months.  
**EBL:** Minimal, but we usually have blood available.  
**Hydration: 4:2:1** (below is just a common reference)Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

  
**Blood sugar levels:** Check every hour. Some literature states these patients should be on a dextrose containing fluid.

**NG Tube:** Usually.  
**Foley:** Yes  
**A-line:** not always anymore. Only if there is associated sepsis, pneumonia, cholangitis or severe cirrhosis.

**Emergence:** Attempt to extubate unless contraindicated, extended duration of procedure, excess blood loss or fluid shift issues.

**Complications of surgical repair and underlying disease states include:  
**Cholangitis  
Portal hypertension

Fat soluble vitamin deficiency  
Bleeding  
Infection
