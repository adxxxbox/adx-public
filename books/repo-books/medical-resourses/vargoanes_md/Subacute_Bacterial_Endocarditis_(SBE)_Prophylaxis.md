### Subacute Bacterial Endocarditis (SBE) Prophylaxis

**Viridans group streptococcal:** VGS  
**Infective endocarditis:** IE  
**Antibiotic prophylaxis:** AP  
  
**Subacute vs acute bacterial endocarditis**  
**Acute bacterial endocarditis:  
**\- It is a rapidly progressive disease with high fevers, rigors, and sepsis.  
\- Usually caused by staphylococcus aureus  
  
**Subacute bacterial endocarditis:**  
\- Its diagnosis is often delayed and presents with non-specific symptoms such as weight loss, fatigue, and dyspnea over several weeks to months.  
\- Usually caused by penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus viridans (VGS)  
  
**The pathogenesis of infective endocarditis (IE) involves:**  
\- Formation of a small thrombus on an abnormal endothelial surface  
\- Secondary infection of this nidus with transiently circulating bacteria in the bloodstream.  
\- The proliferation of bacteria results in the formation of vegetations on the endothelial surface.  
  
\- AP for a dental procedure targets a limited segment of bacterial endocarditis, specifically VGS IE in patients with the highest risk of adverse outcomes.  
\- The decision to use antibiotics before a dental procedure in hopes of avoiding VGS IE rests with both provider and patient.  
  
It should be emphasized to the patient that there is no proven benefit from AP in preventing IE from a dental procedure, and yet there are risks from the administration of AP.  
  
**Patients at the highest risk** **for SBE**  
\- SBE Prophylaxis is suggested only in the setting of conditions associated with the highest risk of an adverse outcome if IE occurs.  
**These include:**  
\- Prosthetic cardiac valve or material  
\- Presence of cardiac prosthetic valve  
\- Transcatheter implantation of prosthetic valves  
\- Cardiac valve repair with devices, including annuloplasty, rings, or clips  
\- Left ventricular assist devices or implantable heart  
\- Previous, relapse, or recurrent IE  
\- Congenital heart disease  
\- Unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease, including palliative shunts and conduits  
\- Completely repaired congenital heart defect with prosthetic material or device, whether placed by surgery or by transcatheter during the first six months after the procedure  
\- Repaired congenital heart disease with residual defects at the site of or adjacent to the site of a prosthetic patch or prosthetic device  
\- Surgical or transcatheter pulmonary artery valve or conduit placement such as Melody valve and Contegra conduit  
\- Cardiac transplant recipients who develop cardiac valvulopathy.  
  
**Dental procedures are considered to have the highest risk for SBE.****  
Dental procedures that involve:  
**\- Manipulation of gingival tissue or the periapical region of the teeth  
\- Perforation of the oral mucosa  
tooth extractions  
\- Drainage of a dental abscess  
\- Routine dental cleaning  
  
**Dental procedures where SBE antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated:  
**\- Anesthetic injections through noninfected tissue  
\- Taking dental radiographs  
\- Placement or removal of prosthodontic appliances  
\- Adjustment on orthodontic appliances  
\- Placement of orthodontic brackets  
\- Shedding or primary teeth  
\- Bleeding from trauma to the lips or oral mucosa  
  
**SBE antibiotic scheduling:**  
\- Antibiotics should be administered 30 to 60 minutes prior to the procedure.  
\- If SBE antibiotic prophylaxis is inadvertently not administered before a dental procedure, then it may be administered up to 2 hours after the procedure.  
  
**If the patient is already taking a course of antibiotics:**  
\- In patients who are receiving a short course (7–10 days) of oral antibiotic therapy before a dental procedure, it is preferable to select a different class of antibiotic.  
\- If possible, it is preferable to delay an elective dental procedure for at least 10 days after completion of a short course of antibiotic therapy.  
  
\- In patients undergoing multiple sequential dental appointments, if possible, it is preferable to delay the following procedure for ten days after the last dose of antibiotic therapy.  
\- In patients receiving parenteral antimicrobial therapy for IE or other infections and requiring a dental procedure, the same parenteral antibiotic may be continued through the dental procedure.

**Note:** Clindamycin is no longer recommended for antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures due to adverse reactions.  
  
**Respiratory tract procedures:  
**There is no direct evidence that bacteremia associated with respiratory tract procedures causes IE.  
  
**AP is only suggested for procedures involving incision or biopsy of the respiratory tract mucosa; examples** **include:**  
Tonsillectomy  
Adenoidectomy  
Bronchoscopy with biopsy  
The antibiotic should be active against VGS.  
  
**Cardiac surgery with prosthetic material:  
**Patients undergoing surgery to place prosthetic heart valves or prosthetic intravascular or intracardiac materials should receive AP for the prevention of IE and surgical site infection.  
  
**Genitourinary and gastrointestinal tract procedures:  
**\- AP is not recommended due to the low risk for IE.  
\- AP is suggested for patients with high-risk cardiac conditions and ongoing GI or GU tract infection.  
  
**Extra notes:  
**\- VGS IE is much more likely to develop as a result of transient VGS bacteremia attributable to routine daily activities such as chewing food and toothbrushing than from a dental procedure.  
\- If AP for a dental procedure is effective in preventing a very small number of cases of VGS IE, it should be suggested only for those patients with the highest risk of adverse outcomes from VGS IE.  
  
Maintenance of good oral health and regular access to dental care are considered more important to prevent VGS IE than AP for a dental procedure.
