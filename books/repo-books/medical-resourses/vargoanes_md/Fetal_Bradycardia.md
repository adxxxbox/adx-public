### Fetal Bradycardia

  
_By Daniel D. Moss CRNA and Jennifer Garris, CRNA_

Fetal bradycardia may be seen after placement and dosing of an epidural and is thought to be secondary to decreased cardiac output, decreased uterine perfusion, or uterine tetany (hypertonia) caused by maternal hypotension and rapid onset of analgesia.

-   Administer oxygen
-   Treat hypotension - ephedrine and fluids wide open
-   Place mother in left uterine displacement position to avoid aortocaval compression.
-   Nitroglycerin 50-200 mcg IV or 400-800 mcg sublingual can be used to improve the oxygenation and heart rate of the fetus - rarely used anymore.
-   Terbutaline 25 mcg SC can be administered to treat uterine tetany

Notify your team if the bradycardia continues and if there is concern for imminent C/S.  
  
Always have quick accessibility to 20 mLs of 2% Lidocaine or 3% 2‐chloroprocaine in case of an emergency C-section (if time permits to dose the patient).  
  
In the olden days, it was OK to carry around a 20 mL syringe of Lidocaine or 3% Chloroprocaine. With JCOH regulations, we really do not do that anymore.
