Aggrenox (Aspirin/Dipyridamole)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Aggrenox (Aspirin/Dipyridamole)

**COX-1 Inhibitor**  
Each hard gelatin capsule contains 200 mg dipyridamole (persantine) in an extended-release form and 25 mg aspirin. The aspirin dose is too low to irreversibly inhibit all platelets for their life span.  
  
**Indications:**  
Prophylaxis to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with previous history of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attacks due to thrombosis.  
  
**Dipyridamole**  
Dipyridamole is an antiplatelet agent that is no longer prescribed as a stand-alone drug, but now combined with aspirin as Aggrenox.  
  
Dipyridamole is a vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation that is used to decrease the risk of thromboembolic complications and recurrence of stroke in patients known to have atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease.  
  
The typical recommended dose varies by indication, but for adults is generally 150 to 400 mg daily in divided doses.  
  
**Mechanism of Action:**  
Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets. This inhibition results in an increase in local concentrations of adenosine which acts on the platelet A2-receptor thereby stimulating platelet adenylate cyclase and increasing platelet cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. The increased cAMP levels inhibit platelet aggregation at the receptor sites on the surface of the platelets.  
  
**Aspirin** is a platelet inhibitor that works by inhibiting platelet cyclooxygenase, which reduces the production of thromboxane A2.  
  
**Metabolism:** Hepatic for both aspirin and Dipyridamole.  
  
Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma to salicylic acid, with a half-life of 20 minutes. Plasma levels of aspirin are essentially undetectable 2–2.5 hours after dosing and peak salicylic acid concentrations occur 1 hour (range: 0.5–2 hours) after administration of aspirin.  
  
**Specific Antidote:** None  
  
Discontinue drug 2 days prior to procedure – unless being treated for stents or CVD.  
**Monitor:** Platelet factor assay (evaluate platelet function).  
  
**Bleeding or high risk surgery within 6 hours:** Consider platelet transfusion.

| Minimal Time between  
last dose and block | Can it be given with  
epidural catheter in place? | When to restart Aggrenox  
after catheter removal |

**Restart medication after procedure:** ASRA - no recommendation.  
**Remove catheter after administration:** ASRA - no recommendation.
