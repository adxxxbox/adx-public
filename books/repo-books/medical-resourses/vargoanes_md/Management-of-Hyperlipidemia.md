### Hyperlipidemia: Management and Recommendations

The goal of lipid-lowering therapy in CABG is to reduce the LDL cholesterol level to <100 mg/dl. Statins are the most commonly prescribed drugs for achieving this goal.  
  
Studies demonstrated that lowering LDL cholesterol with statins influences post-CABG outcomes, and “aggressive” LDL cholesterol lowering (to 60 to 85 mg/dl) is associated with a reduced rate of graft atherosclerosis and repeat revascularization compared with only “moderate” lowering (130 to 140 mg/dl).  
  
Women undergoing PCI and CABG were on average are older than men and more often have diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and severe noncardiac disease.  
  
Because of this, all patients undergoing CABG should receive statin therapy unless contraindicated.  
  
**Potential Adverse Effects of Perioperative Statin Therapy**  
The most common adverse effects reported with statin use are myopathy and hepatotoxicity. Muscle aches have been reported in about 5% of patients treated with statins.  
The presence of active or chronic liver disease is a contraindication to statin use, and patients initiated on a statin should be monitored for the development of myositis or rhabdomyolysis, either of which would mandate its discontinuation.
