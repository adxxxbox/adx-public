### Aprepitant (Emend)

**Class:** Neurokinin 1 (NK1) Receptor Antagonist.  
  
**Indications:** Prevention of nausea and vomiting.  
**Dosing:** Must be given orally preoperatively, 3 hours prior to induction of anesthesia. Often administered in combination with other PONV treatment such as dexamethasone and ondansetron. The approved dose for PONV prophylaxis is 40mg, however the approved dose for Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) prophylaxis is 100-125mg  
(Hemmings & Egan, 2013).  
**Cost of single dose of the drug:** A single dose costs about 100$ (GoodRx, 2016).  
**Mechanism of action:** NK1 receptors are G-Protein-coupled receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system. They are present in the GI tract in high concentrations and are responsible for the vomiting reflex. NK1 receptor antagonists reduce emesis associated with a range of stimuli of the NK1 receptor. Stimulants of the NK1 receptor include opioids, motion, cisplatin and substance P (Hemmings & Egan, 2013).  
**  
Pharmacokinetics and redosing considerations:**  
Peak time is 3 hours (Merck, 2015).  
Half-life is 9-13 hours (Hemmings & Egan, 2013).  
Emend is not re-dosed for PONV, however, cancer patients typically receive a 125mg CINV (cancer induced nausea and vomiting) prophylaxis dose followed by two days of 80mg (Hemmings & Egan, 2013).  
**Anesthesia** **considerations:** Emend decrease the INR in patients taking coumadin and increases plasma levels of ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, neazodone, ritonavir, nelfinacir, verapamil and quinidine  
(Katzung, Masters & Trevor, 2012).  
  
**Emend and hormonal contraceptives  
**Upon coadministration with Emend, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives during and for 28 days following the last dose of Emend may be reduced.  
Alternative or back-up methods of contraception should be used during treatment with Emend and for 1 month following the last dose of Emend.**Reversal agents:** There are no reversal agents or treatments for emend overdose. Emend is not removed by hemodialysis, it is highly protein bound  
(Merck, 2015).  
**Additional Info:** Emend for injection is also available, called fosaprepitant and is converted to aprepitant within 30 minutes; however, this is only indicated for CINV  
(Katzung, Masters & Trevor, 2012).
