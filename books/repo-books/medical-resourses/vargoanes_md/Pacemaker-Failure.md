### Pacemaker Failure during Surgery

**_Never place a magnet prophylactically on a pacemaker!_**

**_What if the Pacemaker stops pacing?_**  
If your surgeon is using a bovie (electrocautery) and all of the sudden the patient’s HR drops dramatically (maybe asystole), you need to tell the surgeon to stop while you place a magnet directly on the pacemaker.  
  
In this situation you sense that the Pacemaker has sensed an external EMI such as the (electrocautery) and it inhibited the pacing function.  
   
The magnet will or should switch the pacemaker to ON to an ASYNCHRONOUS pacing mode at a programmed AV delay and a fixed magnet rate depending on the manufacturer, device model, and the status of the battery. Now the pacemaker completely ignores the electrocautery. The pacemaker paces at its pre-set rate and the heart beats safely again. The blood pressure returns.  
  
  
**What is asynchronous?**  
This mode delivers stimuli at a fixed rate, independent of any atrial or ventricular activity; this mode is rarely used for chronic pacing.  
  
**Manufacturers Magnet rates:**

Guidant 100 bpm  
Biotronik: 90 bpm  
Boston Scientific: 100 bpm  
Medtronic: 85 bpm  
St. Jude: 98 bpm

**Call for the Crash Cart STAT!**  
While this is happening, you still need to call for the crash cart STAT in case the magnet fails or only temporarily works. The crash cart will have a monitor/defibrillator with external pacer pads so the patient can be externally paced. It would not hurt to place the External Pacing Pads on the patient and hooked up to the monitor for back up.  
  
If there is a delay in response, you need to give Atropine and/or Isuprel for the bradycardia. You should always have them available for all procedures when a patient has a pacemaker.  
  
**More Trouble Shooting. Why did this happen?**  
After the patient is stable you need to check the following:  
Where is the grounding pad? It should NOT be near the pacemaker.  
Is the surgeon using monopolar? Monopolar is optimal. Bipolar is not good for pacemakers.  
  
When the patient becomes stable and the surgeon finishes the case, the patient should never be left in the DOO or VOO modes. The rep should be contacted to reprogram the pacemaker in the recovery room.
