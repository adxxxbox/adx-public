### Local Anesthetic Categories - especially in OB

**In OB, we really only need to know of 4 local anesthetics:  
**Chloroprocaine (Nesacaine)  
Lidocaine (Xylocaine)  
Bupivacaine (Marcaine, Sensorcaine)  
Ropivacaine (Naropin)  
  
In general, local anesthetics can be classified as to potency and duration.  
  
**We tend to use 3 categories:  
****Short Acting** (low potency, short duration - 45-90 minutes).**Intermediate Acting** (intermediate potency and duration - 90-180 minutes).  
**Long Acting** (high potency and long duration - 4-18 hours).  
  
**Short Acting (duration of action: 45-90 minutes)  
Ester:** Only has one “I”.**2% or 3% Chloroprocaine** (Nesacaine) - _Urgent C-sections (per epidural)  
_3% for a faster onset than 2%.Chloroprocaine has a relative potency of 1 on an arbitrary scale of 1 - 6.  
Chloroprocaine is fast in onset in spite of its high pKa, probably because it is usually used in a 3% concentration.  
Procaine is in this category, we do not use it in OB.  
Literature varies on duration.  
  
**Intermediate Acting (duration of action: 90-180 minutes)  
Amide:** has two “I”s.**Lidocaine (Xylocaine) -** _Spinals for Cerclage and urgent and non-urgent C-section (per epidural)_  
All are amide local anesthetics and all have a relatively rapid onset owing to intermediate range pKa’s. Depending on the site and the amount injected, their duration of action ranges from 90 - 240 minutes.  
Other Intermediate Acting are Mepivacaine (Carbocaine) and Prilocaine (Citanest)- _not used in OB.  
  
_**Long Acting: (duration of action: 4-18 hours)  
Amides:** has two “I”s.Bupivacaine (Marcaine, Sensorcaine) _Spinal for C-sections and cerclage, epidural infusion_  
Ropivacaine (Naropin) - _Epidural infusions_  
Ropivacaine, bupivacaine have an intermediate onset but a long duration.Etidocaine (Duranest)- _not used in OB_  
Levobupivacaine - _Not used in OB  
  
Easy way to remember long acting local anesthetics:  
acronym “BREL”or BRELEVO” from the first letter of the listed 4 drugs._
