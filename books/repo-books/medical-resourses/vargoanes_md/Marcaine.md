# Marcaine

**Marcaine (Bupivacaine, Sensorcaine) Amide**  
**Class:** Amide type local anesthetic, long-acting.  
Rapid onset for spinal, but slower for a peripheral nerve block. Popular for its long duration 0.125% - 0.75%.  
Lower concentrations may provide a differential sensory block.  
**Preservative:** Methylparaben, can be supplied without preservative.  
All forms are available with epinephrine.  
**Biggest disadvantage:** Severe cardiotoxicity which may occur with high plasma levels causing a refractory cardiac arrest. The ONE drug we do not want to accidentally give IV.  
  
Not recommended for a peracervical block or in concentrations above 0.5% due to the incidences of intractable cardiac arrest.  
  
**Infiltration:** 0.25%  
**Onset:** Fast  
**Duration:** 120-480 mins  
**Max Dose:** w/o Epi: 175mg (70mLs  
) **Max Dose:** with Epi: 225mg (90mLs)  
  
**Peripheral Nerve Block:** 0.25-0.5%  
**Onset:** Slow  
**Duration:** 240-960 mins  
**Max Dose:** w/o Epi: 175mg  
**Max Dose:** with Epi: 225mg  
**Daily Max:** 400mg  
  
**Epidural: 0.5-0.75%**  
**Onset:** Moderate  
**Duration:** 120-300mins  
**Max Dose:** w/o Epi: 175mg  
**Max Dose:** with Epi: 225mg  
  
**Spinal 0.5% in 8.25% dextrose (most popular)**  
**Onset:** Fast  
**Duration:** 60-240 mins  
**Max Dose:** 4mL  
  
Spinal 0.75% in 8.25% dextrose  
**Onset:** Fast  
**Duration:** 60-240 mins  
**Max Dose:** 2.6mL  
Because of the small doses for an SAB, systemic toxicity is not a problem. Therefore, Bupivacaine remains the most widely and cost-efficient long acting local anesthetic used in spinal anesthesia.  
  
**MOA:** Like other local anesthetics, it binds to the intracellular portion of sodium channels and blocks sodium influx into nerve cells, which prevents depolarization.  
**In Detail:** Prevents transmission of nerve impulses by inhibiting the passage of Na ions through their specific channels. It is speculated that local anesthetics bind to specific sites on the inner portion of the Na channels (internal gate or H gate) near their external openings to maintain those channels in an inactivated state.  
  
**Protein bound:** 95% to Alpha1-acid glycoprotein.  
**Metabolized:** Primarily in the liver via conjugation with glucuronic acid.  
**Excreted:** Kidneys  
**Metabolite:** Pipecoloxylidine  
**Half-life:** 2.7 hours in adults and 8.1 hours in neonates.  
  
**Bupivacaine - Cardiovascular toxicity mediated at the heart:**  
First, Bupivacaine exhibits a much stronger binding affinity to resting and inactivated sodium channels than others.  
Second, local anesthetics bind to sodium channels during systole and dissociate during diastole.  
Bupivacaine inhibits Ca channels, release of calcium from sacroplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial energy metabolism, thus multiple direct effects of Bupivacaine on activity of the cardiac myocyte may enhance the cardiotoxicity of Bupivacaine.  
The multitude of different mechanisms of cardiotoxicity may in part explain the reported difficulties of resuscitation after cardiovascular collapse from Bupivacaine.
