Cryoprecipitate    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Cryoprecipitate ("Cryo")

Cryo is a concentrated blood component made FFP.  
It's really only used as a fibrinogen supplement.  
A unit of cryo contains only 40-50% of the coagulation factors found in a unit of FFP, but those factors are more concentrated in the cryo.  
  
**Cryoprecipitate (cryo) contains a concentrated subset of FFP components including:**  
Fibrinogen  
Factor VIII coagulant  
Factor XIII

VonWillebrand factor  
Fibronectin

**Cryoprecipitate is indicated for:**  
Hypofibrinogenemia  
Von Willebrand's disease  
Situations calling for a "fibrin glue."

**Doses:  
**Standard adult dose: pool of 10 -20 units.  
Peds: 1 unit per 10 kg child.  
Blood bank needs 1 hour to prepare.  
Usually a cloudy yellow color.  
Cryoprecipitate is available in pre-pooled concentrates of six units.

**Literature varies concerning how much fibrinogen is in Cryo bags:**  
6 bags (1pool) can contain 2,000mg Fibrinogen.    
Recovery with transfusion = 75%   
Cryo Adult Dose is 10 bags  
1 bag contains ~350 mg Fibrinogen  
10 units will increase plasma fibrinogen about 1gram/L

**In a 70 kg Patient:**: 6 bags (1pool) of cryo raises Fibrinogen 45 mg/dL.  
1 unit per 10kg child, which should increase fibrinogen by 60 - 100 mg/dL.

**Indicated for Bleeding Associated with:**  
Hemophilia A  
Von Willebrand's disease  
DIC  
Uremic bleeding  
Fibrinogen deficiency

**Disadvantage of Cryo  
**Although blood donors are screened for hepatitis and HIV, cryo is not treated to destroy viruses. This is one of the reasons cryo is not a preferred treatment for bleeding disorders in the U.S.

Another disadvantage of cryo is that it must be kept frozen until it is used. Then it must be defrosted.  
Just like FFP, can be stored frozen for up to 12 months.
