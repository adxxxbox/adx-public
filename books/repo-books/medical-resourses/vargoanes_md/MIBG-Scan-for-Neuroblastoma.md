MIBG Scan for Neuroblastoma   

### MIBG Scan for Neuroblastoma

For anesthesia purposes, this is a gamma ray scan that is usually acceptable with an LMA.

The MIBG scan uses a form of the chemical meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) that contains a small amount of radioactive iodine.  
MIBG is actually similar to norepinephrine (NE). After administered IV, it travels and attaches to neuroblastoma cells anywhere throughout the body.

Prior to the MIBG scan, the patient will receive the radioactive injection several hours prior. This scan is basically a special camera to identify areas that “pick up” the radioactivity. This can inform the oncology team where the neuroblastoma is located and whether it has spread to the bones and/or other parts of the body.

Many consider MIBG the standard test in children with neuroblastoma.  
It can also be repeated after treatment to see if it has been effective.  
It is also good to know if the tumor takes up the MIBG because in some cases, this radioactive molecule can be used at higher doses to treat the neuroblastoma.

A more highly radioactive form of MIBG is also used to treat some children with advanced neuroblastoma, often along with other treatments.

**Indications of the procedure  
**Neuroblastoma  
Efficacy of current treatment for neuroblastoma

**Neuroblastoma: A** type of cancer that starts in certain very early forms of nerve cells found in an embryo or fetus. This type of cancer occurs most often in infants and young children. It is rarely found in children older than 10 years.

Neuroblastomas are cancers that start in early nerve cells (called _neuroblasts_) of the sympathetic nervous system, so they can be found anywhere along this system.

Roughly 1 out of 3 neuroblastomas start in the adrenal glands. About 1 out of 4 begin in sympathetic nerve ganglia in the abdomen. The remainder start in the sympathetic ganglia near the spine, in the chest, neck, or within the pelvis.

Rarely, a neuroblastoma spreads so widely by the time it is found that doctors can’t tell exactly where it started.

**Pre-op and what to prepare. What you need to find out? Ex.** Is there cardiac issues or other defects? Does the patient already have an IV or port accessed?

**Anesthetic:** General**Airway issues:** does the patient have an intrinsic need for ETT, otherwise LMA is appropriate**Regional:** none

**Induction:** mask inhalation or IV, advisable to use Versed as these children have had numerous prior anesthetics (decrease anxiety/traumatic experience)**Nitrous:** personal preference**Muscle Relaxation:** none, unless patient is unstable with a deep anesthetic, the patient must remain still for procedure however there is no stimulus**Position** : supine  
**Duration:** 1 -2 hours  
**EBL:** none  
**Blood Bolus dose:** 10-20cc/kg if needed.  
**IV Access:** Newly diagnosis IV will need to be inserted once asleep, established neuroblastoma patients typically have a port that can be accessed

**Hydration:** replace NPO deficit

**Hydration: 4:2:1** **(below is just a common reference)**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**A-line:** none  
**Age Range: <** 1 yr to 10 yrs**Foley Catheter:** may have to in and out cath to empty bladder , the urine will be radioactive**Emergence:** pull LMA deep and insert oral airway, provide O2 source via mask or nasal cannula transport to recovery with pulse Ox and HR monitor and emergency drugs and airway equipment available**  
  
Possible Complications**  
Mild nausea and vomiting  
Tired and sluggish
