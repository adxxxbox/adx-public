### Cardene (Nicardipine) Pharmacology and Notes

**Infusion dose range:** 5-15 mg/hour  
Some anesthesia providers start at 10-15 mg/hour and then titrates to effect.  
**Small bolus of 50-100** **mcg produces:**  
\- Predictable decreases in the SBP of 32–36 mmHg  
\- Decreases in the MAP of 21–24 mm Hg  
\- The maximum response occurs in 60 seconds after drug administration with a short duration due to the rapid redistribution of the drug from a small central compartment.  
  
**Common prepared mixture:** 0.2 mg/mL (40 mg in a 200 mL bag)  
**Common vial:** 2.5 mg/mL (25 mg/10 mL)  
\- 50 mg of cardene in a 250 mL bag of NS: 0.2 mg/mL  
  
**Coronary artery disease:** CAD  
**CO:** Cardiac output  
**EF:** Ejection fraction  
**LVEDP:** Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure  
  
\- Perioperatively, cardene is becoming more popular than nitroglycerine.  
\- Cardene decreases both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.  
  
**Class:** Second-generation dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker.  
Clevidipine is also a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker.  
  
**Dihydropyridines:** Prevent calcium entry into the smooth vascular cells by extracellular allosteric modulation of the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel blockers.

  
**Simple terms:** It blocks the inward calcium currents in peripheral arteriole vascular smooth muscle, thus decreasing arteriole contraction resulting in arteriole dilation.  
  
**Perioperative indications:**  
\- Hypertension  
\- Induce hypotensive anesthesia  
\- Treatment of angina and coronary spasms  
\- Decrease afterload  
\- To avoid post-emergence hypertension (superior to esmolol)  
\- Post-op vascular procedures (carotid endarterectomy)  
\- Post craniotomies (aneurysm repairs)  
\- Pheochromocytoma-adrenalectomy  
  
**Cardene decreases arteriole contraction resulting in arteriole dilation.  
**↓ SVR  
↓ Systolic BP, diastolic BP and MAP  
**Primary affinity:** Peripheral arterioles  
\- Cardene selectively decreases peripheral arteriole smooth muscle contraction resulting in a decrease in arterial blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner.  
\- It has minimal veno-dilatory effects.  
**  
Cardiac effects and facts with cardene:  
**\- ↑ Cardiac output, stroke volume and left ventricular ejection fraction  
\- ↑ stroke index and cardiac index and improved pulmonary wedge pressure during rest and exercise in patients with congestive heart failure and impaired left ventricular function  
\- Has no/little change in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in patients with CAD and normal or moderately abnormal left ventricular function (including those receiving β blockade)  
\- May cause a mild ↑ HR secondary from reflex sympathetic activation (compensatory effort).  
\- No effect on AV or SA conduction time  
\- ↓ Left ventricular lactate production in patients with angina pectoris  
\- Offers a peak LV diastolic early filling velocity, independent of changes in the heart rate.  
\- No significant effects on PR interval, QRS complex, or the QT intervals.  
  
**Coronary artery effects with cardene:**  
↑ Coronary dilation and blood flow  
↓ Myocardial ischemia during transient occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery  
\- Has a low incidence of no-flow during percutaneous coronary interventions  
\- Cardene has shown significant increases in EF and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease, in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP).  
\- With CAD patients, it also improves left ventricular diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase.  
  
**Cerebrovascular effects with cardene:**  
↓ Cerebral vascular resistance  
Does not increase ICP in patients with a severe head injury.  
↓ Symptomatic and angiographic evidence of vasospasm in patients with recent aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage  
↑ Cerebral blood flow in ischemic areas and the middle cerebral artery  
↑ Cerebral blood flow in the internal carotid artery and local cerebral blood flow during aneurysm clipping  
  
**Renal effects with cardene:**↓ Renal vascular resistance after a bolus dose in healthy volunteers  
Has little change in GFR and renal plasma flow in healthy patients  
↓ Total renal vascular resistance and ↑ GFR and renal blood flow in diabetic patients with hypertension and mild to moderate nephropathy.  
May decrease GFR with renal compromised patients.  
May ↑ Sodium and phosphate excretion  
  
**Endocrine:**  
\- No effect on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion  
\- No effect on follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin, or thyroid-stimulating hormone levels,  
↓ Aldosterone response, but no effect on aldosterone response to angiotensin II  
↑ plasma renin activity in pts with salt-resistant hypertension  
  
**Radial artery grafting:** Antispastic effects in radial artery _in vitro._**Mechanism of action:**  
\- Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle.  
\- The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle depend on the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels.  
\- The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle.  
  
**Cardene with beta-blockers with CAD patients:  
**\- Cardene I.V., administered after beta-blockade, may significantly improve systolic and diastolic left ventricular function.  
\- In patients with CAD, it improves L.V. diastolic distensibility during the early filling phase.  
\- There is little or no effect on the normal myocardium.  
  
**Coronary artery dilatation:  
**\- It increases oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue.\- Coronary dilatation-induced and improves perfusion and aerobic metabolism in areas with chronic ischemia, resulting in reduced lactate production and augmented oxygen consumption.  
  
**Cerebral benefits:  
**\- A selective cerebral vasodilator, but it does not increase ICP.  
\- Acceptable choice in stroke patients  
\- It does not increase ICP with acute cerebral hemorrhage.  
\- A selective cerebral vasodilator, however, decreases cerebral perfusion pressure without increasing ICP in patients with acute cerebral hemorrhage . 9  
  
**Renal:  
**\- It may decrease glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and adequate renal plasma flow (RPF)\- With mild to moderate hypertensive patients with renal impairment.  
  
**Pregnancy:** Category C  
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of nicardipine use in pregnant women. However, limited human data on pregnant women with preeclampsia or pre-term labor are available.  
Cardene I.V. should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.  
  
Hypotension, reflex tachycardia, postpartum hemorrhage, tocolysis, headache, nausea, dizziness, and flushing have been reported in pregnant women treated with intravenous nicardipine for hypertension during pregnancy.  
Fetal safety results ranged from transient fetal heart rate decelerations to no adverse events. Neonatal safety data ranged from hypotension to no adverse events.  
  
**Nursing mothers:** Nicardipine is minimally excreted into human milk.  
  
**Reported adverse events of IV cardene during preterm labor:**  
Pulmonary edema  
Dyspnea  
Hypoxia  
Hypotension  
Tachycardia  
Headache  
Neonatal adverse events include acidosis (pH<7.25)  
  
**Drug interactions:**  
**Beta-blockers:**  
Use with caution for heart failure patients on beta-blockers  
**Cimetidine:** May increase nicardipine plasma concentrations with oral nicardipine  
Data with other histamine-2 antagonists are not available.  
**Cyclosporine:** Cardene has been shown to increase cyclosporine plasma levels.  
  
**Metabolism:** Hepatic  
Less than 1% of the intact drug is detected in the urine.  
**Excretion:** Renal  
**Half-life:** 8.6 hours  
  
**Major limitation of Cardene:  
**Longer half-life, which precludes rapid titration.  
Discontinuation of infusion is followed by a 50% offset of action in about 30 minutes.  
  
**Use with caution:**  
With CHF patients or substantial left ventricular dysfunction, especially those receiving concomitant Beta-blockers  
Patients with Heart FailurePatients with Impaired Hepatic FunctionPatients with Impaired Renal Function  
**Contraindications:**  
Advanced Aortic Stenosis  
Allergic to Cardene  
Hypotension  
Heart block  
Recent AMI  
Renal failure  
CHF  
  
**Adverse Effects:**  
The usual from expected consequences of vasodilation.
