Cosyntropin for Postdural Puncture Headache (PDPH)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Cosyntropin for Postdural Puncture Headache (PDPH)

**Generic Name:** Cosyntropin**Brand Name:** Cortrosyn**Drug Class:** Diagnostics, Endocrine  
Cosyntropin is typically used as a rapid screen for adrenocortical insufficiency.  
  
**Dose for screening:** 0.25 mg IV/IM over 2 minutes.  
  
**\- Cosyntropin** is also one of the conservative agents used to manage patients with PDPH.  
\- Some studies show the efficacy is similar to that of, but is slower to take effect than, the current gold standard treatment, an epidural blood patch (EPB).  
  
**Cosyntropin is an analog to ACTH.  
**\- It contains the first 24 of 39 amino acids of natural ACTH.  
\- It shows total corticosteroidogenic activity and less antigenicity.  
\- It increases the production of CSF by stimulating the release of aldosterone.  
\- This decreases the amount of traction and can produce mild beta-endorphin effects (Zeger).  
  
**Many anesthesia providers use a multimodal approach and combine some of the following other conservative treatments:**  
Hydration  
NSAIDs  
Caffeine  
Antiemetics  
Bedrest  
Fioricet (a combination of acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine  
  
**Mechanism of action of Cosyntropin:**  
\- It stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and weak androgens.  
\- It activates adenylyl cyclase and increases intracellular cyclic AMP, which is the second messenger for most, if not all, of the effects of ACTH.  
\- Corticosteroids exert several indirect effects on the central nervous system.  
**  
Most patients respond with the following:**  
\- Mood elevation  
\- It lowers the immune responses of lymphocytes, which is essential in the anti-inflammatory actions of glucocorticoids.  
  
**Cosyntropin simplified mechanism of action concerning PDPH:  
\-** Increased aldosterone secretion (fluid and electrolyte retention)  
**\-** Promotion of dural edema→ overlap of the puncture site**\-** Increases CSF production through active Na+ transport**\-** Causes a release of brain B-endorphins  
\- Anti-inflammatory action  
  
**The prophylaxis use of cosyntropin for PDPH:**  
\- An adult study by Hakin demonstrated a reduction of PDPH with the administration of cosyntropin for the prophylaxis treatment of PDPH following an unintentional dural puncture (wet tap).  
\- More studies are warranted to determine precisely the role of synthetic ACTH analogs in treating PDPH.**  
  
Onset:**  
\- A median time for a 50% pain reduction is about 5 hours has been reported.  
\- The median time to discharge after the first dose ai usually 20 hours (range - 2 to 72 hours).  
\- However, some cases have slightly improved, and an EPB is still required.  
  
**Documented dosing:  
Common dose:** 0.5-1 mg for PDPH  
\- Doses of 0.25–0.75 mg have been used in clinical adrenal function studies.\- 5 to 15 mcg/kg (median, 10.4 mcg/kg)  
\- It has been added and administered in 1 liter of Ringer’s lactate over 4-8 hours.  
  
**The risk of cosyntropin administration is low.**  
\- Aside from the rare hypersensitivity reactions, the toxicity of ACTH is primarily limited to the increased secretion of corticosteroids.  
  
**The most common side effects of cosyntropin include the following:**  
\- Minor irritation at the injection site (redness, swelling, or a rash)  
\- Fast or slowed heart rate  
\- High blood pressure, and  
\- Swelling in the arms or legs  
  
**Documented severe side effects from cosyntropin:  
**Hives  
Difficulty breathing  
Swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat  
Itching  
Red, swollen, blistered, or peeling skin with or without fever  
Wheezing  
Tightness in the chest or throat  
Difficulty swallowing or talking  
Unusual hoarseness  
Headache  
Dizziness  
Fainting  
Vision changes  
Fast or slow heartbeats  
Swelling in the arms or legs  
**  
Possible contraindications:  
**\- Cosyntropin may cause hypertension and increased blood glucose.  
\- Patients who would likely not be good candidates include patients with diabetes, those at risk for infection, and those with blood pressure concerns.  
\- Patients allergic to it.  
**Other notes:  
**Invasive treatments for PDPH: (when conservative treatment fails)  
\- Epidural blood patch (EPB): The gold standard for treating PDPH.  
**\- Greater occipital nerve block** interrupts pain transmission to the trigeminal and greater occipital nerves, which are activated by dural stretch in PDPH.  
\- Transnasal sphenopalatine ganglion block  
  
\- Cosyntropin shows the total corticosteroidogenic activity of natural ACTH.  
\- Cosyntropin may be particularly beneficial as an alternative to an EPB, including for patients who have contraindications to blood patches.
