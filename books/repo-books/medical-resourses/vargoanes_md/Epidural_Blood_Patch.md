Epidural Blood Patch (EBP)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Epidural Blood Patch (EBP)

\- EPB is the gold standard for treating moderate to severe post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) with a success rate of 61-98%.\- An EBP is a procedure in which a small volume of autologous blood (up to 20 mLs) is injected into a patient's epidural space to stop a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak.  
\- It is an elective procedure that carries a relatively low degree of risk.  
  
**The average volume of blood to infuse:** 16-20 mLs, 20 mLs is the most common.  
  
**Indication:**  
\- Post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) in people who don't respond to conservative treatment (hydration, analgesics, IV/PO caffeine) and who will not tolerate the 7 to 10 days in which most dural puncture headaches usually resolve.  
**Most common clinical scenario:** A pregnant woman receiving epidural anesthesia for labor.  
  
**Mechanism of action:**  
Decreases or stops further CSF loss by forming a blood clot over the defect in the meninges and a tamponade effect of cephalad displacement of CSF.  
  
**PDPH onset:** Usually within 72 hours after the inadvertent dural puncture.  
For more details, refer to “Post-Dural Puncture Headaches” in this app.  
  
**Contraindications for EBP:**  
\- Anticoagulated patient  
\- Coagulopathy  
\- Infection at the injection site  
\- Patient refusal or lack of cooperation  
  
**Possible complications or side effects:  
**\- A second wet tap  
\- Patch failure (may require a 2nd patch)  
\- Bleeding  
\- Infection  
\- Meningitis  
\- Neurological sequelae  
  
\- EBPs are usually carried out in a maternity theatre or a room at the delivery suite.  
**\-** If the patient receives prophylactic Lovenox, ensure that the last dose was given at least 12 hours before performing an EBP.  
  
**Personnel:** It is much easier with a registered nurse assisting the anesthesia provider-blood draw.  
**  
Procedural and aftercare steps for an EBP:  
**\- Advise the mom to feed her baby and pass urine before the procedure, as she will have to remain flat in bed after the blood patch.\- Obtain a written, informed consent  
\- Establish IV access that blood may be drawn from (usually 18 gauge, AC site).  
\- Make sure blood can easily be aspirated from the IV before starting.  
  
**Patient positioning:** Preferably the lateral position to decrease CSF leakage  
  
**Epidural needle placement:**  
\- The epidural space at or below the level of the previous dural puncture with an aseptic technique  
\- Collect 20 mLs of autologous blood from the IV using a sterile technique.  
\- Slowly inject the 20 mLs (5 ml increments) of collected blood through a Tuohy epidural needle until the patient reports pain, the feeling of discomfort, or fullness in the back, buttocks, or neck, whichever comes first.  
\- Have the patient remain in the recumbent position for 1-2 hours.  
\- 1 liter of crystalloid may help reduce the PDPH until the EPB starts working.  
  
**Patch failure:**  
\- You may repeat the EBP 24 hours if the first one fails.  
\- The 2nd EPB is often successful.  
\- Consider a different diagnosis if the PDHD remains after the 2nd EPB.  
  
**Consider the following discharge instructions:  
**\- Advise the use of over-the-counter analgesics (i.e., acetaminophen, ibuprofen) when necessary for any mild residual discomfort.  
\- Prescribe stool softeners or cough suppressants if indicated.  
\- Avoid lifting, straining, or air travel for 24 hours.  
\- Provide instructions on contacting anesthesia personnel in case relief has not been sufficiently compelling or if symptoms return.
