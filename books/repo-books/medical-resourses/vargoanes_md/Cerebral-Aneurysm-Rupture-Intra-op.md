### Cerebral Aneurysm Rupture Intra-op

  
**Symptoms of a rupture during or after induction:**  
An abrupt increase in BP with or without bradycardia.  
The ICP might also increase as well. 

Some surgeons want you to decrease the BP for a bloodless field as they clip the ruptured aneurysm. Other surgeons may want you to increase the BP to perfuse the other side of the brain.  
  
**In case of rupture, this is what you need to do:**

**Tell the circulator to call for additional anesthesia help.**

**Immediately ask the surgeon where he wants the BP.**  
**Ask the surgeon if he wants Burst Suppression: If he does, bolus the patient with Etomidate.**  

**Then Give Blood ASAP!** We have seen 2L blood loss within 2 minutes and 4 liter blood loss in 5 minutes. If this ever happens during your case, you will learn to respect the Circle of Willis.  
**Then give a full syringe of your NDMR.**  
  
**Then Hyperventilate and use 100% O2. If you have done a good job of hydration, a good anesthetic, and pressure control, then at this point you only have 2 tasks: blood replacement and pressure stabilization.**

**Goals of an Inta-op Ruptured Cerebral Aneurysm:**  
Maintain cerebral perfusion.  
Control ICP.

Reduce bleeding: lower the MAP to 40-50mmHg with Propofol or nitroglycerine (if the surgeon requests a lower BP).

**Cerebral Aneurysm Rupture With Induction**     
Immediately Intubate and secure the ETT. And rotate the OR bed ASAP.  
Giving more Propofol lowers the BP and affords some cerebral protection.  
However, excessive lowering of the BP at this time can be detrimental if it interferes with cerebral perfusion. Surgeon needs to do an immediate craniotomy to accomplish "rescue clipping."  
Alternatively, the ipsilateral carotid artery may be manually compressed for up to 3 minutes to produce a bloodless field.

**Chance of a Rupture in Aneurysm surgery:**  
7% before dissection.  
48% during dissection.  
45% during clip ligation.

  
**Initial Rupture Symptoms:** There is an initial abrupt rise in ICP that produces a severe headache and possibly LOC. Blood in the CSF produces meningism (photophobia, neck stiffness AKA nuchal rigidity, and headache).
