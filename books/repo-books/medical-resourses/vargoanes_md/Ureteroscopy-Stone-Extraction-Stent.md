### Ureteroscopy, Stone Extraction and Insertion of Stent

This procedure is done through a rigid cystoscope, so “Cystoscopy” is part of the procedure.  
 

**NOTE:**  
**Distal Ureteral stone**: You want the patient motionless when the doctor has the ureteroscope inserted 10 inches up the ureter. Sudden movement could cause severe damage. Check with the doctor because he/she may demand relaxation or a spinal.  
  
**Proximal Ureteral Stone:** Usually does not need relaxed. Check with the surgeon.  
  
**Ureteroscopy**  
A cystoscopy must be done in order to thread the ureteroscope into the bladder and then into a ureter. A ureteroscope is utilized for this procedure. It is a special, thin instrument to look directly inside the ureter. It allows visualization of stones in the ureter and/or kidney. Ureteroscopes are generally flexible and resemble long straws.

   
The urologist will be able to see the stone through the ureteroscope and can then remove it with a small basket at the end of a wire fed through the ureteroscope.

Depending on the location, size and composition of the stone, the urologist will sometimes use a laser to break the stone into small pieces that will pass through the urine.

**Anesthesia:**  
**General:** ETT or LMA-depending on location of the stone and if the surgeon  
wants relaxation:  
Spinal-sometimes-rare  
**Duration:** 30-90 minutes  
**IV Access:** 20G  
**EBL:** Minimal

**Stent Placement:**  
A stent may be inserted into the ureter to keep it open for urine drainage.  
  
**Indications for Ureter Stent Placement**  
Ureter edema  
Ureter was dilated  
Infection  
Stone extraction 

A stent will also allow any ureteral post-operative swelling or reaction to subside.  
  
**Possible Complications**  
Perforated ureter: requiring an open procedure to repair it.  
Infection
