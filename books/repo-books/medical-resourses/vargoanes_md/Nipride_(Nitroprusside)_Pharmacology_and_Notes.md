# Nipride (Nitroprusside) Pharmacology and Notes  

Not as popular as it once was.  

Mix 50 mg in 250 ml in NSS or D5W(200mcg/mL).  
Mix 100mg in 250ml in NSS or D5W (400mcg/mL).  
Continious BP monitoring per A-line (manufacturer states to just mix with D5W)  
**Dose:** 0.25-5 mcg/kg/min(some literature has up to 8mcg/kg/min)  
Cyanide levels should be checked every 24 hours  
Antidote for cyanide is sodium thiosulfate

* * *

**Use:** Hypertension, afterload reduction  

* * *

**Class;** Arteriolar and veno vasodilator via Nitric Oxide group donor  

* * *

**Mechanism**: Direct venous and arteriolar dilation  

* * *

**Elimination**\-metabolized to cyanide and then to thiocyanate, which in turn is excreted by the kidney. Risk of severe hypotension in patient who is intravascularly dry.  
Overcomes hypoxic vasoconstriction in the lungs, so initiation can cause increased VQ mismatch and therefore more difficulty in oxygenation.

* * *

**Thiocyanate toxicity symptoms:** Tinnitus, blurred vision (miosis), delirium hyperreflexia) thiocyanate toxicity may not reflect cyanide toxicity  
Thiocyanate is mildly neurotoxic at serum levels of 60 mg/L (1 mmol/L).  
Thiocyanate toxicity is life-threatening when levels are 3 or 4 times higher (200 mg/L).

* * *

**Precautions:** Monitor cyanide levels, especially in the setting of renal failure. **Adverse Effects:** Hypotension, tachycardia, N/V, impaired renal function.

Doses > 3mcg/kg/min > 72 hours may cause thiocynate toxicity, cyanide toxicity.  
Risk of severe hypotension in patient who is intravascularly dry.  
Overcomes hypoxic vasoconstriction in the lungs, so initiation can cause increased VQ mismatch and therefore more difficulty in oxygenation.  
Treatment includes amyl nitrate, Na Nitrite and Na Thiosulfate

* * *

**Contraindications:**  
Compensatory hypertension  
A-V shunt  
Coarctation of the aorta  
Pts with uncorrected anemia  
Hypovolemia  
Known inadequate cerebral circulation  
Liver Disease  
Severe renal disease  
Hypothyroidism  
(Since thiocyanate inhibits both the uptake and binding of iodine, caution should be exercised in using nitroprusside in patients with hypothyroidism and patients with severe renal impairment).  
Leber's optic atrophy  
Tobacco amblyopia  
Disease states associated with vitamin B12 deficiency.

**Adverse Reactions:** Fatalities from to cyanide poisoning

Above 2ug/kg/min, nipride can cause cyanide toxicity. At the high end range, infusion should never last more than 10 minutes.  
If BP is not controlled after 10 minutes, stop the infusion.  
Measure Thiocynate levels daily - do not exceed 100 mg/L.  
Peritoneal dialysis can be helpful to reduce high levels of thiocyanate.  
High rates of Nipride can be fatal. ABGs displaying metabolic acidosis is evidence of cyanide toxicity.  
Infusion rates > 2mcg/kg/min generate cyanide ions (CN faster than the body can normally rid of it.  
Antidote sodium thiosulfate increases the body's capacity to eliminate it.  
Methemoglobin normally present in the body can buffer a certain amount of cyanide but it is limited.

* * *

**Pregnancy**: The safety during pregnancy has not been established; Should be given only when the potential benefits have been weighed against possible hazard to mother and child.

Nipride is photosensitive, so the bag should be covered (shielded from light) should not be kept or used longer than 12 hours.  
Irritation of the injection site may occur.

* * *

**Symptoms of overdose:**  
Excessive hypotension or cyanide toxicity or as thiocyanate toxicity.  
Dyspnea, headache, vomiting, dizziness, ataxia and loss of consciousness.  
  
**Massive overdosage produces:**  
Coma  
Absent reflexes  
Widely dilated pupils  
Pink color  
Distant heart sounds  
Hyperkalemia  
Metabolic acidosis

**The treatment of cyanide toxicity:**  
D/C Nipride  
Provide a buffer for cyanide by using sodium nitrite to convert as much hemoglobin into methemoglobin as the patient can safely tolerate, then infuse sodium thiosulfate in sufficient quantities to convert the cyanide into thiocyanate. A cyanide antidote kit with specific directions is available from Eli Lilly Canada Inc.
