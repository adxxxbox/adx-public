### Organ Donor Anesthesia and Notes

The donor patient is usually already in the ICU with the appropriate lines, drips and is ventilated.  A member of the organ procurement team (usually an RN) will inform you where to keep the patient’s BP, what drips to run and what needs maintained. They will even supply you with new drip IV bags so you won’t have to mix or call pharmacy if any drip is almost empty. They will pretty much tell you everything you will need to know. It is their job. They are your source of info and your best friend during this case. Hopefully you will get a good coordinator who communicates well, is calm in a storm, and has some experience. It is OK to use them for medical advice because the surgeon is rightly very focused on the procedure; so let the procurement coordinator guide you along.  In many institutions, the anesthesiologists do not do these cases because of reimbursement issues. CRNAs are flying solo in these cases.   

There could be up to 5 transplant teams in the operating room at once (2-3 people per team).

Anesthesia is only needed until the aorta is cross-clamped. However, if the lungs are to be taken, you will have to stay until they are retrieved.

If the patient has a Swan Ganz catheter, you shouldn’t have to worry about cardiac outputs. You will just need to be expected to monitor the CVP. 

Keep the patient warm because these patients have a nonfunctional Hypothalamus. Warm the operating room, use a lower body-warming blanket and warm the IV fluids. Use Pavulon, Vecuronium or Atracurium. You don't have to use an inhalation agent, but some CRNAs still prefer to. Before the case starts, make sure you have a fast flowing IV. Have Mannitol, Hespan, Heparin, Lasix and Dopamine available.

  
Maintain 100% FiO2; the patient may need PEEP on ventilator settings.Keep SBP > 90-100 mmHg. Stay within 20-25% of baseline.The patient may require vigorous volume replacement-check with Transplant RN.

UOP: Maintain at > 2cc/kg/hr. Always! Give Lasix or Mannitol if requested.REMEMBER: Once cross-clamped, you are done unless the surgeons are taking the lungs!A lung surgeon may invade your space by performing a bronchoscopy to assess the patient’s lungs.  Prior to cross- clamping the aorta, the surgeon may ask you to administer around 30k units of Heparin. Ask about Heparin if the surgeon does not mention it.Record cross clamp time on your anesthesia record. The heart and lungs are removed 1st.

**Organ Removal in order:**

Heart >lungs > pancreas > liver > kidneysTissue will come out after anesthesia is done!

Don't do anything outside of guidelines from MD request or Transplant RN Coordinator.
