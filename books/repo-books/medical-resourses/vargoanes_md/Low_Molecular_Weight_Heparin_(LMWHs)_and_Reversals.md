### Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWHs) and Reversals

**LMWHs:  
**Dalteparin (Fragmin): half-life is 2.2 hours.  
Enoxaparin (Lovenox): half-life is 4.5 hours.  
Tinzaparin (Innohep): half-life is 3.9 hours.  
  
Subcutaneous injection: half-life is prolonged.  
  
**Quick Notes  
Low Molecular Weight Heparin Reversal of Bleeding.  
**Protamine sulfate may be used as a partial reversal agent (neutralizes approximately 60% of LMWH’s anti‐factor Xa activity).  
  
**LMWH -** major bleeding occurs in 1-4% depending on dose and underlying condition.  
  
**Lab Monitoring:  
**LMWHs are not routinely monitored.  
  
**AntiXa Activity (LMWH) assay:** Most reliable.  
**Optional Labs:** PTT, ACT, or TEG  
**APTT:** Only slightly affected.  
  
**AntiXa Activity (LMWXA) monitoring with LMWH (when needed).**  
If measuring is desired, check peak antiXa level 3-4 hours after dose.  
Observed peak AntiXa levels for Q12h dosing of LMWHs = 0.5-1 units/mL.  
Observed peak antiXa levels for Q24h dosing of LMWHs = 1-2 units per mL.  
  
You can also check trough antiXa levels prior to the next dose = < 0.5 units/mL.  
  
Elevated troughs suggest impaired clearance.  
  
aPTT displays a linear dose-response to LMWH, but there is still variation.  
  
**LMWH Therapeutic Ranges (target anti-Xa levels measured 4 hours after dosing):**  
**Enoxaparin (Lovenox)**  
Therapeutic bid dosing 0.6-1.0  
Therapeutic qDay dosing >1.0  
  
**Tinzaparin (Innohep):**  
Therapeutic qDay dosing 0.85.  
  
**Dalteparin (Fragmin):**  
Therapeutic qDay dosing 1.05.  
  
**Specific antidote:** Protamine  
  
**Protamine Facts**  
Maximum single dose is 50mg.  
Never bolus: may result in profound HYPOtension.  
  
**Protamine Allergy**  
Increased risk of hypersensitivity reaction, including anaphylaxis, in patients with a fish allergy or prior exposure to protamine.  
Premedicate with corticosteroids and antihistamines if at risk for protamine allergy.  
  
**Non-urgent**  
Hold LMWH the day of procedure  
**Once-daily regimens:** May consider ½ dose day prior to procedure.  
  
**Twice-daily regimens:** Hold evening dose day prior and morning of procedure.  
  
**Urgent: No major bleeding  
**Wait 12-24 hours if possible.  
Consider protamine sulfate if a delay not possible for procedures associated with high risk for bleeding.  
  
**Life-Threatening Bleed  
**Hematology/Coagulation consult is recommended.  
Protamine sulfate  
Additional products may be needed to obtain hemostasis PCCs.  
  
rVIIa: no proven role.  
FFP: no proven role.  
  
**Enoxaparin (Lovenox) and Protamine Doses**  
**Last enoxaparin dose given within 8 hours:** 1mg protamine per 1mg enoxaparin given.  
**Last enoxaparin** **dose given within 8-12 hours:** 0.5mg protamine per 1mg enoxaparin given.  
  
Repeat dose 0.5 mg protamine for every 1 mg of 1mg enoxaparin given if bleeding continues or elevated anti‐factor Xa activity level after 2‐4 hours.  
If bleeding persists in an imminent life threatening event, FEIBA 8 to 25 units/kg can be considered.  
  
**Tinzaparin (Innohep) and Protamine Doses  
Last tinzaparin dose given within 8 hours:** 1mg protamine per 100 units of tinzaparin.**Last tinzaparin dose given within 8-12 hours:** 0.5 mg protamine per 100 units of tinzaparin.  
  
Repeat dose 0.5 mg protamine for every 1 mg (or 100 units) of LMWH if bleeding continues or elevated anti‐factor Xa activity level after 2‐4 hours.  
  
If bleeding persists in an eminent life-threatening event, FEIBA 8 to 25 units/kg can be considered.  
  
**Dalteparin** **(Fragmin) and Protamine Doses**  
**Dose within 8 hours:** 1mg protamine per 100 units of dalteparin  
**Dose administered between 12-24 hours:** 0.5 mg protamine per 100 units of dalteparin.  
  
If bleeding persists in an imminent life-threatening event, FEIBA 8 to 25 units/kg can be considered.  
  
Repeat dose 0.5 mg protamine for every 1 mg (or 100 units) of LMWH if bleeding continues or elevated anti‐factor Xa activity level after 2‐4 hours.
