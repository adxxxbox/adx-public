### CAD and Anesthesia

All CAD patients should be on a beta blocker protocol.

Simply said: Keep the HR slow and BP (diastolic) mildly high.  
Remember, the coronary arteries are perfused during diastole, and the better the diastolic pressure, the better the perfusion.  
 

Metoprolol and a Neosynephrine Drip are your 2 most popular drugs. Remember, Neosynephrine does not constrict the coronary arteries.

All CAD patients (who see a doctor) will usually be on a beta blocker. If they aren’t, we usually give 5mg of Metoprolol as long as it’s not contraindicated sometime before induction.

The patient should already have an EF or Cath lab study. A low EF will indicate Etomidate for induction.

Check to see if the patient has stents. Find out when the patient received them and what kind they are (See Cardiac Stents and Surgery). If they have stents, keep the pressure adequate (at least systolic 120s) and well hydrated.

HR - slow, slow, slow 45-70 bpm.  
Never induce an elective CAD patient case if patient is tachycardic. Give Metoprolol first. Just using a Neosynephrine drip helps keep the rate slow.
