Thrombin Time (TT)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Thrombin Time (TT)

**_Also known as thrombin clotting time (TCT)_**  
  
Measures the **time** it takes for a clot to form in the plasma of a blood sample containing anticoagulant after an excess of **thrombin** has been added.  
**The reference range:** < 20 seconds (i.e., 15-19 seconds), but this depends on the test kit/instrumentation used in the laboratory. Healthy infants up to age 6 months may have a thrombin time prolonged by 2-3 seconds.  
  
Thrombin time (TT) directly assesses the activity of thrombin. This test is useful in patients receiving dabigatran (Pradaxa). A normal TT excludes dabigatran activity; the degree of elevation of the TT is not a direct correlate of serum levels.  
  
Thrombin time is a screening coagulation test designed to assess fibrin formation from fibrinogen in plasma.  
  
**Anticoagulants that prolonged thrombin time:**  
Heparins  
**  
Direct Thrombin IIa Inhibitors (DTIs)**  
Argabatran (Acova, Argatra).  
Desiruden (Revask, Iprivask, Hirudin).  
Dibigatran (Pradaxa, Pradax, Prazaxa).  
Lepirudin (Refludan).  
  
**Interpretation**  
A normal thrombin time excludes abnormalities in the fibrin formation process of the coagulation cascade.  
  
**Shortened thrombin time:**  
Rare; is observed in patients treated with dextran or hydroxyethyl starch or in individuals with certain forms of hereditary dysfibrinogenemia.  
  
**Prolonged thrombin time**  
Indicates a fibrinogen abnormality, impairment of fibrin formation, and/or a thrombin inhibitory effect.  
  
**Fibrinogen abnormalities include:**  
Severe hypofibrinogenemia (fibrinogen level < 0.7-1 g/L).  
Afibrinogenemia (congenital or acquired).  
  
Congenital or acquired dysfibrinogenemia  
Extreme hyperfibrinogenemia (fibrinogen >14 g/L), but not mild fibrinogen elevation due to the acute phase response.  
  
**Impairments of fibrin formation include the following:**  
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (presence of fibrin degradation products, d-dimer).  
  
Abnormal circulating proteins due to amyloidosis or multiple myeloma.  
  
**Thrombin inhibitory effects include the following:**  
Heparin, hirudin, and direct thrombin inhibitors.  
  
Circulating antibodies to thrombin.
