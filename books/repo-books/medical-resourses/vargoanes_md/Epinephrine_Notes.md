### Epinephrine Notes

Strong sympathomimetic affecting Alpha and Beta-1 and Beta-2 receptors. Comes in 1:1,000 and 1:10,000 concentration.  
For Infusion, use 1:1,000 (1mg/ml) in 1ml ampule and add 1-4 ampules (1-4 mg) into a 250ml bag of NS or D5W.  
  
Infusion rate may be calculated in **mcg/min** or **mcg/kg/min**  
  
**Common** dilutions:  
Dilute 1mg in 250ml = 4mcg/ml (1mcg/min = 15ml/hr)  
Dilute 2mg in 250ml = 8mcg/ml (1mcg/min =7.5ml/hr)  
Dilute 4mg in 250ml = 16mcg/ml (1mcg/min = 3.8ml/hr)  
Dilute 8mg in 250ml = 32mcg/ml (1mcg/min = 1.9ml/hr) (Rarely used; requires 8 vials)  
  
**Dose range** 1-16mcg/min  
Administer at an initial rate of 1 mcg/minute and increase to desired effects; at 20 mcg/minute, pure alpha effects occur.  
**Equation for mcg/min:** Infusion rate (ml/hr) = desired dose / (mcg/cc x 60).  
  
**Cardiovascular Responses**  
Increased heart rate via beta-1 agonism.  
Increased myocardial contractile force and cardiac output via beta-1 agonism.  
Increased systemic vascular resistance via alpha-1 agonism.  
Increased arterial blood pressure via alpha-1and Beta-1 agonism.  
Increased myocardial oxygen consumption.  
Increased automaticity and irritability of heart.  
Bronchodilation via Beta-2 agonism.  
Pupillary dilatation.  
  
**Precautions:** Should be protected from light. Can be deactivated by alkaline solutions.  
  
**Side Effects:** Palpitations, anxiety, tremulousness, nausea and vomiting.  
  
**Administration:** Always use large IV-preferably a central line to avoid infiltration, which causes extravasation necrosis. Extravasation necrosis may be treated with phentolamine.
