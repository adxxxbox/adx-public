# Rocuronium Bromide (Zemuron)

Rocuronium is a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent with a rapid to intermediate onset depending on dose and intermediate duration

* * *

**Class:** Aminosteroid

* * *

**Onset**: 1-2 minutes

* * *

**Peak**: 1-3 mins  

* * *

**Duration**:30-40 mins

* * *

**Recovery time**: 31-67 minutes

* * *

**Elimination**: Renal/Hepatic  

* * *

**Pregnancy Category B**

**Histamine Release**: in 0.8% of the patients

* * *

**Indications:**  
Adjunct to general anesthesia  
To facilitate endotracheal intubation  
To provide good skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation

* * *

**Drug Interactions:**  
Select antibiotics (aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, piperacillin, polymixin B):- may increase or prolong neuromuscular blockade.  
Magnesium salts:- may increase or prolong neuromuscular blockade.  
Ketamine:- may increase or prolong neuromuscular blockade.  
Inhalation anesthetics (halothane, enflurane,isoflurane):- may increase or prolong neuromuscular blockade.  
Quinine derivatives:- may increase or prolong neuromuscular blockade.  
Furosemide, phenytoin, theophylline, and carbamezpine:- may decrease neuromuscular blockade.

* * *

**Warnings:**  
Small doses may have profound effects on patients with MYASTENIA GRAVIS or Eaton-Lambert Syndrome.  
Patients with cirrhosis or cholestasis have prolonged recovery time.  
Can be is associated with increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Thus,the drug should be used with caution in pulmonary hypertension

* * *

**Adverse Reactions:**

Prolonged Muscle Relaxation  
Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, abnormal electrocardiogram, tachycardia  
Digestive: nausea, vomiting  
Respiratory: asthma (bronchospasm, wheezing, or rhonchi), hiccup Skin and Appendages: rash, injection site edema, pruritus Strength-very fast onset like sucs, except with a loger duration 0.6-1.2 mg/kg will provide excellent or good intubating conditions in most patients in less than 2 minutes  
Careful when redosing because it can last much longer as compared to redosing with Norcuron. You can get burned at the end of your case still waiting for twitches.  
Some redose Rocoronium with Norcuron. They are both Aminosteroids so it is not a problem.

* * *

**Clearance:** 50% unchanged in bile, 30% urine (duration may be increased with chronic renal failure) (Renal/Hepatic)

* * *

**Other:** Slightly vagolytic. Relaxation not as profound as succinycholine. Vd and duration increased with liver disease.
