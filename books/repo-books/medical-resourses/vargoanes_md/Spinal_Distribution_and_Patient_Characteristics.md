### Spinal Distribution and Patient Characteristics

**Patient characteristics that affect the spread of a local anesthetic include:**  
Age  
Height  
Intra-abdominal pressure  
Anatomic configuration of the spinal cord  
Patient position during and immediately after injection.  
  
**Age**  
Age plays a negligible role in block height  
As we age there are anatomical changes in the subarachnoid area which may increase block height- not very predictive.  
  
**Height**  
Height plays a minor role. However, for the very short the dose of local anesthetic should be decreased, and for the very tall it may need to be increased-not overly predictive.  
  
**Intra-abdominal pressure -** plays a role in relation to engorgement of epidural veins, decreasing CSF volume, resulting in a higher subarachnoid block. Conditions that increase intra-abdominal pressure include: pregnancy, obesity, ascites, large abdominal tumors, etc.  
  
**Anatomic configuration of the spinal cord** \- natural lordosis and thoracic kyphosis influences spread of the local anesthetic solution. Medications injected above L3, with the patient in a supine position after injection, will spread cephalad reaching the thoracic curvature at T4. Abnormal anatomic changes that affect CSF can impact the level of blockade. Conditions such as severe kyphosis or kyphoscoliosis can result in decreased CSF volume and higher than expected blockade.  
  
**Patient position** \- patient position during blockade is one of the most important factors along with local anesthetic dose and baricity that can affect the spread of local anesthetic and subsequent block height. This is a function of baricity and position of the patient. For example, a hyperbaric solution administered in the sitting position will result in a higher concentration of local anesthetic in the lower lumbar and sacral areas. A hyperbaric solution in the lateral position will result in a greater concentration of local anesthetic in the dependent portion of the patient. A hypobaric solution administered in the prone/jack knife position will result in blockade of the lower lumbar and sacral areas. Patient position is especially helpful after administering a hyperbaric solution. If the patient is left sitting up, the sacral and lower lumbar distribution will have a dense block. If the patient is supine, in a Trendelenburg position, hyperbaric solution will spread further reaching thoracic dermatomes.
