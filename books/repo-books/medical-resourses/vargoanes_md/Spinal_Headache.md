### Spinal Headache

**(Post-Dural Puncture Headache, post spinal Headache, post lumbar headache)

**Causes** :

1.  **Dural Rent** \- Leakage of Spinal fluid through the dural hole (usually created by the passage of a needle through the Dura) This Leakage causes an overall decrease in Cerebrospinal fluid volume within the cranial vault. Though the brain itself has no pain receptors **,** there are pain receptors in the meninges that line and cover the **brain. The** brain is attached to the skull via the meninges (specifically the Dura Mater) **.** When the volume of CSF decreases **,** it causes the brain to sink within the cranial vault **,** thus causing tension to develop at the points of attachment with the skull **.** This stimulates the pain receptors in the Dura Mater, leading to a headache.  
      
    
2.  **Pneumocephalus** \- When air is introduced into CSF it rises and if it collects in the ventricles (Cerebral) **,** it causes severe irritation. This most commonly occurs when using air vs. saline in a loss of resistance technique when placing an Epidural.

**Symptoms:  
**The typical presentation of a spinal headache is an extreme and excruciating headache that is improved by placing the patient supine, and is worsened by sitting the patient up. With a Pneumocephalus the symptoms are typically very similar. However, the primary difference is a quick onset particularly if the patient is sitting up as this allows the air to rise quickly into the ventricles. With a Spinal headache due to a dural rent **,** the onset is usually not as fast, requiring time for the CSF to leak and the brain to drop in the cranial vault.

**Treatment:**

1.  Caffeine - Is a conservative treatment for a spinal headache, albeit an off-label one. When I have used it has been as a delaying tactic until an epidural blood patch can be performed. I have yet to see it resolve the headache alone, but the caveat of that is that most spinal headaches will disappear on their own within two weeks and without intervention.

    | Caffeine Doses | Oral - 300mg | IV 500 mg in a 1000cc bag of NS infused over 1 hr.  
    Second dose can be given in 5 hrs. |

2.  Epidural Blood Patch - By far the gold standard for treatment of Spinal Headache. The Epidural blood patch works in two different ways. First, the blood is thought to replace the volume of CSF lost, and second to seal the hole by forming a clot at the dural rent.  
      
    
3.  Sphenopalatine ganglion block has a high success rate in treating post dural puncture headaches.
