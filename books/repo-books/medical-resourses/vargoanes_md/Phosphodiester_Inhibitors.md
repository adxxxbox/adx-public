### Phosphodiester Inhibitors

**Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors  
**  
Exact mechanism is unknown.  
  
Cilostazol and its metabolites probably inhibits PDE III activity, thereby suppressing cAMP degradation (decreasing ADP levels). ADP is needed for GPIIb/IIIa receptors on the surface of the platelets to bind with fibrinogen for platelet aggregation.  
  
Phosphodiesterase is a ubiquitous enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds. It is responsible for the hydrolysis of cyclic 3,5 adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and 3,5 cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).
