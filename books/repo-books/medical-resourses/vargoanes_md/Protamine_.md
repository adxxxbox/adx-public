### Protamine

**Protamine and Heparin  
Heparin Antidote:** Protamine Sulfate.  
No more than 50 mg of Protamine should be administered (unless needed to reverse large doses of heparin during heart surgery).  
**Never bolus.  
  
Common Doses:** 1-1.3 mg of protamine for every 100 units of heparin administered.  
The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Assume that the half-life of Protamine is about 30 minutes after intravenous injection.  
  
**Other Protamine Doses:**  
CABGs: 300-400u/kg  
Vascular: 3-10,000u  
Thromboembolic prophylaxis: 5,000 SQ  
  
**Protamine doses for Heparin infusion:**  
For reversal from a continuous IV infusion of heparin at 1,250 units/hour, 30 mg of protamine sulfate can be administered.  
If the Heparin infusion has been held > 60 minutes, administer 0.5 mg protamine/100 units of heparin.  
If the Heparin infusion has been held > 2 hours, administer 0.25 mg protamine/100 units of heparin.  
**Note:** Because the half-life of IV heparin is relatively short, with effects dissipating rapidly after stopping the IV infusion, consider calculating a lower dose of protamine from the amount of heparin administered within the preceding few hours.  
  
**If aPTT remains elevated:** Repeat administration of protamine 0.5mg/100 units heparin can be considered.  
  
**Possible Side Effects:** Severe hypotension, flash pulmonary edema and allergic reactions may occur with rapid administration.**Onset: < 5 minutes  
Half-life of Heparin:** 60-90 minutes  
  
**Rebound Anticoagulation effect with Subcutaneous Heparin**  
Duration is irreversible and dose dependent.  
Rebound of anticoagulation risk with subcutaneous heparin can occur. Additional protamine may be indicated 2-4 hours after initial dose.  
  
**Low Molecular Weight Heparins (LMWHs) and Protamine  
_Warning:_** _Despite some literature, protamine only partially reverses LMWHs.  
Protamine is recommended for reversal but only partially reverses the anti-Xa activity and there are very limited data on clinical effectiveness._  
  
**Enoxaparin (Lovenox, Clexane) reversal with protamine.  
Last enoxaparin dose within 8 hours:** 1mg protamine per 1mg enoxaparin given.  
It will only partially (~60%) reverse effects of enoxaparin.  
**Last enoxaparin dose 8-12 hours earlier:** 0.5mg protamine per 1mg enoxaparin given.  
  
Duration is irreversible and dose dependent.  
  
**Rebound Anticoagulation effect with Subcutaneous Enoxaparin  
**Duration is irreversible and dose dependent.  
Rebound of anticoagulation risk with subcutaneous heparin can occur.  
Additional protamine may be indicated 2-4 hours after initial dose.
