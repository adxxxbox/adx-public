**EKOS - (Ultrasound Accelerated Catheter (Directed Thrombolysis)**

**Catheter Directed Thrombolysis (CDT) with Ultra Sonic Component or**

**(Pulmonary Angiogram for Lysis of Pulmonary Embolism) or**

**Percutaneous Angiogram with Initiation of EKOS**

**Short Story:**  
This is usually an emergency procedure for a PE or DVT.  
A catheter with multiple holes at the distal end is immediately inserted via groin or IJ to penetrate the thrombus.  
The delivery catheter is designed to deliver a thrombolytic drug uniformly into the thrombus (usually TPA at 0.25-1mg/hour).  
Multiple ultrasound transducers that are inserted into the drug delivery catheter will enhance the TPA penetration into the thrombus.  
The patient is then transported back to the ICU on a TPA and heparin drip.  
The patient will return in 1-2 days for the catheter to be pulled.

**Indications:**  
Phlegmasia cerulean dolens, which is a painful blue edema from severe DVT.  
Acute or subacute IVC thrombosis  
Acute iliofemoral (proximal) DVT  
Acute femoral-popliteal DVT  
Subacute or chronic iliofemoral DVT  
Acute or subacute pulmonary embolism

**Pre-op:**  
What is the patient’s pulmonary status?  
If the patient you will be receiving is having the procedure done for a pulmonary embolus, be prepared for a poorly oxygenated, dyspneic patient.

For a pulmonary embolism, a pulmonary angiogram will be performed and the patient’s face will be turned to the side and covered, so inform the patient.

**Pressure Transducer**: You will need one available to connect to the arterial line and zeroed. It is a male to female connection and you may need a 3-way stop cock added to the transducer.

**Anesthesia**: MAC with ETCO2

**Position:** Supine and arms tucked. Bed rotated 90 degrees.  
Make sure your IV flows well when the IV arm is tucked.  
The surgeon may request Trendelenburg or Reverse Trendelenburg.  
For a pulmonary angiogram, the doctor may utilize the right IJ to access the pulmonary vasculature.  
The patient’s head will need turned to their left. Consider placing a nonrebreather mask (or appropriate oxygen therapy based on the oxygenation saturation) before the patient’s neck is prepped and covered.

**Sedation level:** Do not over-sedate the patient.  
The doctor will want the patient to take deep breaths with the dye injection, like an aortogram.

**C-arm:** Yes. You will need a lead apron.

**A-line:** Usually not

**EBL:** Minimal; from line placement

**Foley Catheter:** Yes

**Duration:** 1-2 hours

**Contraindications to Thrombolytics:**  
Intracranial neoplasm  
Recent (<6 weeks) major surgery or trauma.  
Active bleeding  
Uncontrolled hypertension

**More Notes:**  
A pulmonary angiogram is performed via a pulmonary catheter.  
If a PE is located, a special ultrasound catheter is threaded and advanced into the pulmonary thrombus.

The purpose of the EKOS EndoWave Infusion Catheter System is to enhance the catheter-directed thrombolysis by accelerating the fibrinolytic process with the application of ultrasound.

Improving the efficiency of the thrombolytic process reduces the treatment time and total lytic dose delivered, thereby lowering the overall cost of therapy and the risk of an associated bleeding complication.

**Thrombolytics:**  
tPA  
Alteplase (Cathflo, Activase)  
Reteplase  
Tenacteplase  
Urokinase

**More Notes**:  
The EKOS is a multi-sideholed catheter with ultrasound transducers.  
Ultrasound enhances the penetration of the thrombolytic agent into the clot and may shorten the duration of thrombolytics therapy.

Frame Catheter:  
most popular  
2 sizes exist an 8F & 6F.  
The treatment length is at 15cm or 30 cm.

This catheter has occlusion balloons spaced at intervals to concentrate thrombolytic delivery and minimize systemic circulation.An The proximal and distal balloons are to isolate the clot.  
A sinusoid dispersion wire is inserted into the catheter and rotates at 3,000 rpms.
