Hemicolectomy - Right or Left     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Hemicolectomy - Right or Left

**Right Hemicolectomy**  
Part or all of the ASCENDING colon and cecum are removed. The colon is then reconnected to the small intestine.

**Left Hemicolectomy**  
Part or the entire DESCENDING colon is removed. The transverse colon is then reconnected to the rectum.

**Indications:** Usually to treat tumors, bleeding trauma and inflammation.

These procedures are mostly laparoscopic, sometimes open. If the case is laparoscopic, you won’t have to hydrate the patient as much because it is not an open belly case, thus less insensible water loss.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
Usually RSI if the abdomen is distended.  
**Nitrous Oxide:** No  
**Thoracic Epidural:** Sometimes, not as common anymore. Helps for post op pain.  
**Duration:** 1-3 hours  
**IV Access:** 1 18G for a lap, and 2 for an open procedure.  
**Typed and Screened**: Yes  
**OG Tube:** Yes, unless the surgeon wants an NG tube. NG tubes are becoming more rare.  
**A-Line:** Not indicated.  
**EBL:** 50-200 mLs; depends on the surgeon.  
**Position:** Supine and steep Trendelenburg.  
**Bowel Prep:** Usually not because the surgery focuses on the ascending colon.   
**Fluid Deficit:** Usually not**.** Depends if the patient received a bowel prep and how long the patient has been NPO. 

**Possible Complications**  
Incisional hernia  
Ileus  
Small bowel obstruction  
Abdominal abscess  
Anastomotic leak  
Wound infection
