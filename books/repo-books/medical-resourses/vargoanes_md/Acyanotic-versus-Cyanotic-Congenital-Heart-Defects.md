Acyanotic versus Cyanotic Congenital Heart Defects   

## Acyanotic versus Cyanotic Congenital Heart Defects

Cyanosis is noticeable when >5 g/dL of deoxygenated hemoglobin is present. It may be difficult to detect unless the SaO2 is ≤ 85%. Cyanosis is best seen in the tongue and oral mucosa.  
  
**Cyanotic Heart Defects:** Are a result of right to left shunting. This is when unoxygenated blood mixes with oxygenated blood and LOWERS the overall concentration enough to cause cyanosis.  
  
**Cyanotic heart defects includes  
**Tetralogy of FallotTransposition of the great vesselsPulmonary atresiaTotal anomalous pulmonary venous returnTruncus ArteriosusHypoplastic left heart syndromeTricuspid valve abnormalities .

**What are acyanotic heart defects?**

Acyanotic heart defects usually do not cause cyanosis. However, cyanosis can occur during activities and exertion.

**Acyanotic congenital heart defects include:  
**Ventricular septal defect (VSD)Atrial septal defect (ASD)Atrioventricular septal defectPatent ductus arteriosus (PDA)Pulmonary valve stenosisAortic valve stenosis  
Coarctation of the aorta  
  

**Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO)**

PFO is not considered a heart defect. It happens in many healthy people and most of the time it does need treatment.
