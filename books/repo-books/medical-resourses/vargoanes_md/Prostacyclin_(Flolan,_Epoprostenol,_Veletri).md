### Prostacyclin (Flolan, Epoprostenol, Veletri)

**Classes:** PAH, Prostacyclin Analogs  
  
Naturally produced by the blood vessel wall and is the most potent known inhibitor of platelet aggregation induced by such stimuli as ADP and thrombin.  
  
A metabolite of arachidonic acid, is a naturally occurring prostaglandin with potent vasodilatory activity and inhibitory activity of platelet aggregation.  
  
**Epoprostenol has 2 major pharmacological actions:**  
Direct vasodilation of pulmonary and systemic arterial vascular beds  
Inhibition of platelet aggregation.  
**Indications:** Treat severe pulmonary hypertension patients and prevent thrombosis.  
  
**IV Administration:** Continuous through a central line (very short half-life).  
  
**Mechanisms of Action:**  
It binds to a specific platelet receptors and activates adenylate cyclase, raising the cyclic AMP level in platelets. The lack of ADP inhibits the mobilization of specific platelet receptors for fibrinogen on platelets and that this effect parallels the inhibition of ADP- or thrombin-induced aggregation.  
  
**Doses:  
Pulmonary Hypertension:** Initial: 2 ng/kg/min IV infusion pump over 24-48 hours, then titrate by 1-2 ng/kg/min q15min or longer, until desired effect or dose-limiting pharmacologic effects occur.  
  
**Units:** nanograms  
1,000,000 = 1 nanogram (ng)  
  
IV Administration: Continuous through a central line.  
  
**Monitoring:** Little literature available.  
This drug is an antiplatelet medication so platelet function assay would an option.  
  
**Metabolism:**  
Prostacyclin is metabolized by arachidonic acid through the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway, is a potent vasodilator and one of the most effective drugs for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  
  
**Metabolites:** 6-keto-PGF1α and 6,15-diketo-13,14-dihydro-PGF1α **.  
**Fourteen additional minor metabolites have been isolated from urine.  
  
**Half-life:** 3-6 minutes  
  
**Excretion:** Urine (84%); feces (4%)  
  
**Adverse Effects:**  
Hemorrhage  
Hypotension  
Flushing  
Headache  
Nausea  
Vomiting  
Diarrhea
