Up to 12 percent of parturients meet the criteria for the diagnosis of thrombocytopenia.In general, patients with thrombocytopenia have an increased risk of spinal/epidural hematoma with neuraxial procedures.

_Based on the patient’s platelet count, there is no set arbitrary threshold determining to perform a neuraxial procedure._

It is a common for the anesthesia provider to further investigate and decide whether to proceed with a neuraxial procedure with thrombocytopenic patients.

**General Data**

-   In a 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis of papers published between 1947 and 2018
-   Reviewing 7,509 neuraxial procedures in a cohort of heterogeneous patients with thrombocytopenia
-   Most spinal epidural hematomas occurred in patients with lumbar punctures and platelet counts <50,000 × 106/L.6
-   14 occurred within ranges of 1,000–25,000 × 106/L
-   6 occurred within ranges of 26,000–50,000 × 106/L
-   5 occurred within ranges of 44,000 and 91,000 × 106/L (2 after epidural and 3 after spinal procedures)
-   9 occurred within ranges of 51,000– 75,000 × 106/L
-   4 occurred within ranges of 76,000–99,000 × 106/L

**Neuraxial procedures defined**

-   Spinal
-   Epidural
-   Combined spinal epidural
-   Dural puncture epidural
-   Epidural catheter removal

**Thrombocytopenia and neuraxial anesthesia**

_The decision to proceed with neuraxial anesthesia depends on the downward trend of platelet count and clinical signs of bleeding or coexisting coagulopathy rather than an arbitrary threshold value._

_Most practitioners recommend against catheter placement if the platelet count is less than 75,000_

-   It is necessary to check a screening platelet count on patients with pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders, (e.g., pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome)
-   Thrombocytopenia is considered a relative contraindication to neuraxial analgesia because of the unknown risk of hematoma
-   However, there is no general agreement on the platelet count threshold for withholding neuraxial anesthesia
-   Preoperative platelet transfusion should be strongly considered when platelet count is low. 
-   Other causes of coagulopathy must be ruled out
-   A TEG (Thromboelastogram) can be performed to assess a detailed assessment of coagulopathy

-   Furthermore, a TEG-guided strategy has been associated with a reduction of blood product transfusion to correct coagulopathy

-   Bleeding time has not been shown to be a helpful parameter in assessing patients for coagulopathy, as it often doesn’t correlate well with clinical bleeding

**Thromboelastography (TEG) and Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM)**

-   Are dynamic tests that may be performed at the point of care to evaluate the viscoelastic properties of blood clots in whole blood subjected to rotational forces
-   There have been studies reporting the use of ROTEM or TEG with normal parameters before neuraxial procedures in obstetric patients with thrombocytopenia without spinal epidural hematoma formation
-   Other studies in oncologic patients with thrombocytopenia have reported no correlation between TEG and ROTEM parameters and clinical bleeding except at very low platelet counts

**Whether to proceed with neuraxial anesthesia in the thrombocytopenic obstetric patient can be divided into 2 categories**

-   Patient with a known thrombocytopenia etiology
    -   Patients with a known diagnosis of ITP should have a hematology workup prior to pregnancy
-   Patient without a known thrombocytopenia etiology
    -   Patients with gestational thrombocytopenia will have had a normal platelet count before pregnancy or early pregnancy and had a decline during pregnancy to ≥70,000 × 106/L

_Additionally, in some centers, expert hematologic consultation is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; at others, it is rarely or never available_
