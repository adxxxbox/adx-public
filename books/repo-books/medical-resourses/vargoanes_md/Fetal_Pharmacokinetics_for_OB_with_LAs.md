### Fetal Pharmacokinetics for OB with LAs

**Concentration of a local anesthetic within the maternal uterine artery depends on:**  
Total dose  
Route of administration  
Presence of epinephrine  
Maternal metabolism and excretion  
Maternal protein binding  
Maternal pH and the pKa of the drug  
  
**Concentration of local anesthetic within the fetal umbilical artery depend on:** Umbilical vein concentration (input)  
Fetal pH  
Fetal protein binding  
Fetal tissue uptake  
Non-placental elimination (fetal hepatic metabolism and renal excretion).  
  
The transfer of LA from the mother to fetus takes place via the placenta in the intervillous space.  
  
It is the unbound (free) drug that crosses the placenta. Unbound local anesthetics can travel either way across the placenta.  
  
LA bound to plasma proteins will not cross the placenta to the fetus.  
Thus, the more protein-bound the local anesthetic, the less local anesthetic enters the fetal circulation. Bupivacaine is an example of a local anesthetic that is highly protein-bound.  
  
Alpha-1-acid glycoproteins (AAG) have high affinity for local anesthetics but are small in number compared to albumin. AAG will saturate with local anesthetics first.  
  
Albumin has a low affinity for local anesthetics and is abundant.  
  
Fetal blood has 60% the albumin content of maternal plasma.  
  
AAG concentration is 20-30%.  
  
The remaining 10% consists of various other proteins.  
  
If a local anesthetic is 75% bound to maternal plasma protein, one out of four molecules are free and can cross the placenta.  
  
If the local anesthetic concentration in fetal blood is 75% of that in maternal blood (the fetal-maternal drug ratio = 0.75).  
  
With fetal acidemia, there is more cation trapping thus increasing the ratio.  
  
**When Free Lidocaine Crosses the Placenta**  
When free lidocaine crosses the placenta, it is converted and charged in the acidotic fetus and it can’t exit fetal tissue by diffusion. The lidocaine becomes trapped in the fetus. When the fetal pH is corrected, the ratio reverses making free lidocaine available to passively diffuse back to the mother down a concentration gradient restoring the lidocaine concentration.  
  
_Increased concentrations of a local anesthetic (such as those given intravascularly) can transfer to the fetus and result in decreased neonatal neuromuscular tone similar to that seen with magnesium_
