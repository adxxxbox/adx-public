### Harvesting BIMAs (Bilateral Internal Mammary Arteries)

Numerous observational studies have demonstrated improved morbidity and mortality rates when both IMAs are used.  
However, there is some controversy on harvesting both internal thoracic arteries due to compromising blood flow to the anterior chest. Postoperative complications observed in diabetic and obese (BMI>30 kg/m2) individuals included sternal dehiscence, phrenic nerve palsy and increased incidence of sternal wound infections. Some surgeons harvest the LIMA and partial RIMA for that reason.  
However, most surgeons spare the RIMA, harvesting only the LIMA and saphenous vein.
