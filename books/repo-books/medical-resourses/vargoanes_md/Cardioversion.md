### Cardioversion - Elective

_Edited by Betsy Majma CRNA_  
  
Electrical cardioversion of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is commonly performed to relieve symptoms and return the patient's heart to a sinus rhythm.  
  
**Indication:** Patients who have failed drug therapy (chemical cardioversion) to reverse a new onset of dysrhythmia.  
  
**Possible locations for cardioversions include:**  
**Pre-op or PACU:** This is convenient and safer for the patient because there are monitors, resuscitation equipment, suction, and available staff with adequate airway experience.  
  
**Cardiac station or ICU:** You have many ICU staff available, and most of the nurses appear to have adequate experience  
Not as compromising as a hospital floor.  
  
**Hospital floor room:  
\-** You should have all medications and airway equipment readily available.  
\- If the patient crashes, you are on your own until help arrives.  
\- When airway problems occur, they can deteriorate rapidly to hypoxia and cardiac arrest if not dealt with quickly.  
\- Two pairs of hands trained in airway skills are often needed to retrieve patient viability in such a situation.  
  
**\- Note:** If you are out in the periphery on a hospital floor and feel the patient looks unstable or too compromised to tolerate elective cardioversion safely, request that the patient be cardioverted in or near the operating room.  
\- The operating room area has sufficient anesthesia colleagues to assist if something goes wrong readily.  
**  
Possible Diagnosis (indications):**  
Atrial fibrillation-most common  
Atrial flutter  
Other supraventricular tachyarrhythmias  
Ventricular tachyarrhythmias  
  
**Contraindications:**  
A Full stomach.  
Digitalis toxicity > 3  
Inadequate anticoagulation  
  
**Goal:** Restoring sinus rhythm.  
External cardioversion is a short, painful procedure with stimulus intensity similar to a surgical incision.  
  
**The Anesthetic Goals are:**  
Prevent recall of an unpleasant experience  
Deep sedation with rapid onset and offset  
Maintaining hemodynamic stability  
Maintain a patent airway  
Limit apnea  
  
There are many agents and cocktails utilized today.  
Unfortunately, the ideal pharmacological agent to produce all of the above for elective cardioversion does not exist. So, we tend to compromise.  
  
Many can argue that it is safer to risk a patient experiencing a degree of recall than having respiratory depression or airway obstruction with hemodynamic instability.  
  
**Pre-op History:**  
**AF frequently accompanies:**  
Hypertension  
Chronic heart failure  
Valvular or ischemic heart disease  
Strokes or mini-strokes due to emboli  
All AF patients should be on ASA &/or another agent to prevent this.  
  
Check for a history of CHF, CAD/MI and valvular problems.  
What is the SaO2 on an NC?  
Is the patient dyspneic?  
Mottled?  
Is the patient exhibiting air hunger?  
Labs: Electrolytes and coags  
**  
Goals:  
**PT- 1.5-2 x baseline.  
INR < 3  
K+ is equal to or greater than 3.  
Look at their most recent magnesium and calcium levels.  
**  
Patient airway (Especially out in the periphery away from OR/ICU/CCU):**  
\- If the patient has a huge neck and appears to have a challenging airway, you may consider calling for backup.  
\- You and I know how difficult it is to manage an obstructed difficult airway with a jaw thrust and expect to administer meds if necessary at the same time.  
\- With experience, you can just look at some patients and know you would have difficulty mask ventilating them alone.  
  
**Are they Anticoagulated?**  
\- All Patients undergoing cardioversion are treated conventionally with therapeutic anticoagulation for three weeks before and four weeks after cardioversion to decrease the risk of thromboembolism.  
\- If the patient has a new onset of AF lasting LESS THAN 24 hours, they MAY be able to be cardioverted right away without anticoagulation.  
\- AF longer than 24 hours usually requires anticoagulation therapy.  
  
**Thrombolytic Strokes with AF:**  
\- AF is associated with significant mortality and morbidity, particularly from thromboembolic stroke.  
\- Most strokes associated with AF are presumed to be from thrombi formed in the fibrillating left atrial appendage.  
\- There is a 15-fold embolic stroke rate if the patient has a history of rheumatic heart disease.  
\- With chronic AF, they will require lifelong ASA/anticoagulation.  
  
**TEE before Elective Cardioversion:**  
\- A TEE/ECHO should be able to detect a left atrial appendage thrombus.  
\- If a left atrial thrombus is identified, the cardioversion will be CANCELED!  
\- Electrical cardioversion could dislodge the thrombus, causing an embolic stroke and possibly death.  
\- If the patient does not have a thrombus, the cardioversion will be performed immediately while the patient is still sedated.  
\- The patient will require more propofol with a combined TEE/cardioversion.  
\- Once the TEE tube is advanced into the esophagus, it is not very stimulating.  
  
**Pre-procedure:**  
\- Make sure you have the patient’s consent and warn them of the possibility of recall and all other risks.  
\- Ensure that the patient did NOT receive any p.o. KCL to correct deficiencies prior to cardioversion.  
\- “NPO” to a floor nurse often does not necessarily include medications, and frequently this population has potassium deficiencies.  
  
**Preparation:**  
**Emergency Equipment at the Bedside:  
**Appropriately sized oral airways/tongue depressors within arms reach.  
An Ambu Bag/Mask **out of the bag**  
Suction set up and turned on  
ETT/stylet  
Laryngoscope  
Flush Syringes  
Patent IV  
  
**Standby emergency medications:**  
Ephedrine  
Norepinephrine or epinephrine  
Atropine  
Anectine  
Many beta-blocked patients respond better to epinephrine than ephedrine.  
  
\- An Ambu Bag/Mask **out of the bag** and on the patient’s bed, ready for use.  
\- A crash cart and monitor will already be in the room.  
  
**Patient’s Bed Positioning:  
**\- There needs to be adequate space between the head of the bed and the wall if you need to position yourself there for necessary aggressive airway management.  
\- However, we all know that needing to intubate for cardioversion is extremely rare.  
\- However, if you ever lose the airway, the last thing you want is to lose time trying to get to the head of the bed to intubate or manage the airway.  
  
**Pre-oxygenate:  
**\- Having the patient take deep breaths through their nose to build up their FRC can make a big difference during periods of apnea.  
\- A nasal cannula with 3-4 LPM is the most popular.  
\- A simple mask or nonrebreather can be used for compromised patients.  
  
**ETCO2:** It should be monitored, but it is commonly not.  
Most areas do not have an ETCOs measuring device at the bedside.  
  
\- OPTIMIZE the head/pillow position and tilt their head back.  
\- This enhances a patent airway.  
\- Many anesthesia providers will remove the patient’s pillow and have them extend their head back just before the cardioversion to enhance a patent airway.  
  
**Drug Cocktails:  
Most popular:** Propofol and lidocaine  
**Propofol:** 30 to 50 mg (most common dose upon anesthesia providers)  
50+ mg of propofol for TEE/cardioversion double procedures  
**Lidocaine:** 50-100 mg IV to blunt the gag reflex prior to the TEE is common.  
  
**Other cocktails (very rare):**  
\- A low dose of **Fentanyl** and **Versed** (or both) permits a lower dose of Propofol.  
However, it may delay the wake-up and contribute to post-cardioversion bradycardia.  
**Brevital:** (rarely given) 40-50 mg for initial shock, then 20-30 mg for all subsequent shocks.  
A standard dose calculation is to subtract the patient’s age in years from 100.  
  
**Remifentanil:** (rarely given)\- 1-2mcg/kg IV push  
\- It lacks amnestic effects and may contribute to a short period of post-cardioversion bradycardia.  
If the first cardioversion fails to convert the AF back to sinus, be prepared to quickly administer more sedation for a second or third attempt.  
\- It is common for the cardiologist to increase the voltage for the second cardioversion.  
  
**Bradycardia following Cardioversion:**  
\- Bradycardia is common and often quite profound for the first 1-2 minutes post-shock.  
\- It is usually temporary immediately following the cardioversion.  
\- It usually does NOT require treatment- be patient.  
\- Low dose Atropine or Robinul may be given if the patient is symptomatic and the bradycardia does not resolve.  
\- Your job is done when the patient is converted to sinus and is awake and responsive.  
  
**Possible Complications:  
**\- Loss of airway  
\- MI or myocardial ischemia from increased BP (catecholamine surge).\- Severe bradycardia –give atropine 0.4mg/kg.  
\- Recall  
\- Hypotension  
\- Decreased CO and/or CHF from inadequate atrial contractility following cardioversion.  
\- New dysrhythmia.  
\- Stroke from emboli during conversion to SR-This is why you check neuro status.  
  
**More Notes:**  
\- A biphasic waveform energy charge for the cardioversion is more efficient, requiring only 20–170 J.  
\- The monophasic waveform requires 50–360 J.  
\- The shock is delivered using two external paddles placed in one of the standard positions: anterior-posterior (A-P), basilar-apical, or apical-posterior.  
\- The charge is delivered synchronously to the QRS to avoid inducing tachyarrhythmias.  
\- The shock to treat ventricular fibrillation is asynchronously given (defibrillation).  
  
**Settings for A-Fib:** R-wave synchronized biphasic DC at 120 joules.  
If ineffective, it may be increased to 150 and 200 joules.  
  
**Settings for A-Flutter:** R-wave synchronized biphasic DC at 50 joules.  
  
**Fire precautions:**  
\- Remove any nitroglycerine ointment or TTS patches away from the electrodes before the cardioversion.  
\- For highly hairy men, consider trimming down the hair or finding a non-hairy spot…or use a LOT of gel!  
\- The pads won’t work well through hair.
