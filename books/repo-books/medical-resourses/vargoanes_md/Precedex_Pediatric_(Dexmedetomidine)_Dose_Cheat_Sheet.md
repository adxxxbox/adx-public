Intranasal | 1 mcg/kg  
0.5-2 mcg/kg |

followed by an infusion of 0.5-3 mcg/kg/hour |

epileptic seizure | IV | 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg/hour |
| Cardiac surgery | IV | 0.5 mcg/kg/hour followed by  
1 mcg/kg/hour |
| Applications to benefit the  
recovery period  
Adenotonsillectomy | IV | 0.5-1 mcg/kg/hour |

agitation | IV | 0.2-1 mcg/kg x 1 |

  
Obtunds airway reflexes while maintaining stable hemodynamic and respiratory profiles in spontaneously ventilating children and adults.  
Provides sedative properties paralleling natural sleep.**Peds emergence:** Dilute 25mcg in a 5mL syringe (5mcg/mL) and titrate (manually) to effects for a smooth emergence.  
It may delay wake-up time.  
  
**Pediatric outpatient procedures:**  
Many experienced pediatric anesthesia providers prefer to administer around 0.4 mcg/kg after induction.  
Administering DEX any later in the procedure may prolong emergence and postoperative time.  
  
**Total body weight TBW) vs Ideal body weight (IBW) is controversial.  
**An article posted in 2015 stated that DEX dosing regimens should be based on IBW rather than TBW because obese patients have a larger volume of distribution of the drug than normal-weight patients.  
It was found that plasma concentrations of DEX were higher, and elimination half-time was longer in morbidly obese patients than in non-obese patients. However, other literature often refutes this.
