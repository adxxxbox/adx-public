Breast Reconstruction - Stage II     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Breast Reconstruction - Stage II

This is replacing tissue expander(s) with breast implant(s). Once the tissue expander \[placed into a breast cavity or pocket in a prior procedure\] has been expanded to the desired size, the patient is taken back to surgery for the next stage of her breast reconstruction. The tissue expander(s) is deflated, removed and replaced with implant(s).

During the procedure, the plastic surgeon will occasionally want to elevate the head of the bed up almost 90 degrees for unilateral comparisons of the implants.  Make sure you have slack with the ventilator tubing and monitor cords while you are sitting the patient up. Also determine the position of the patient’s head during a “sit up”. Keep an eye or a hand on the ETT.

**Anesthetic:** General/LMA or ETT, usually LMA.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Not required except by some surgeons. One surgeon in our facility will take the tissue expander out, then do a capsulotomy requiring neuromuscular blockade before he inserts the permanent breast implants.  
**Position:** Supine with arms out.  
**BP cuff:** Opposite of the involved Axillary Node or on a leg.  
**Duration:** 90mins -3 hours  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable. Opposite side of the involved Axillary Node. It’s OK to place an IV in the foot when bilateral axillary nodes were previously removed.   
**EBL:** 1-200mLs  
**Antibiotics:** Ancef if not contraindicated.  
Remember: Ancef is redosed every 4 hrs.  
**Emergence:** Besides the cancer, most of these patients are healthy with a pretty good airway. Deep extubations are common.
