### BKA (Below the Knee Amputation

**Note:** Many of these patients have had extremity bypass grafts in the past.

**Common Comorbidities**  
Peripheral vascular occlusive disease.

Possible CAD.  
HTN, DM and ESRD.  
Extremity ischemia.

Peripheral neuropathy.  
Gangrene

Many have poor compliance and still smoke.

Many have scaly dry skin, and non-healing and/or infected sores on their legs or feet.

**Anesthetic:**  
General or Regional. However, I have rarely seen a regional done just for an amputation.  
Many patients are diabetic with aspiration risks, so we usually intubate. An LMA is more convenient if the patient is not an aspiration risk.

Have a Neosynephrine drip ready, because you are treating these patients like a CAD patient.  
**Duration:** 60-90 minutes  
**Position:** Supine with arms out.  
**EBL:** 50-200mLs; the surgeon should be using a tourniquet.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable. Many of these patients have difficult IV access.    
**Tourniquet:** Usually  
  
**Possible Complications:**  
Intra-op cement fracture.  
DVT  
UTI from the Foley.  
Urinary retention if a urinary catheter is not used.  
Wound Infection.  
Hematoma  
Post-op subluxation fracture.  
Femoral/Sciatic nerve damage.  
 

**Possible Regionals**  
Femoral/Sciatic

Spinal

Popliteal/Saphenous

  
Surgeons preserve as much length in thigh amputations as is medically feasible because longer stumps provide better control over the prosthesis.

**Amputation Facts:**  
 90% of patients with BKAs will successfully use a prosthesis. 

AKAs have only a 25% success rate. 

For amputations with ischemic disease, the level of amputation is chosen based on the blood supply and therefore the best chance for successful healing.

Patients with diabetes have 10-fold increased risk for lower extremity amputation compared with those who do not have diabetes.
