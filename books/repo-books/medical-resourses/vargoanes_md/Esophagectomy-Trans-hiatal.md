Esophagectomy-Trans-Hiatal (THE)     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Esophagectomy-Transhiatal

The removal of at least two thirds to the entire esophagus. This usually involves a general and thoracic surgeon. The patient is supine and usually does not require a DLT. It is the most common form of esophagectomy.  

**Indications:** Esophageal CA or Barrett’s Esophagitis  

**Procedure:**  
Two incisions are made, one on the left side of the neck and the other on the abdomen. The proximal part of the stomach and esophagus is dissected free from the surrounding tissue. The diseased part of the esophagus is removed. The stomach is stapled in a way to create a tubular shape. The stomach is pulled up through the chest (under the heart) so it can be anastomosed to upper remaining esophagus. The thoracic surgeon has his/her hand in the left neck incision and pulls the new tubular shaped stomach upwards and reconnects it to the remaining upper esophagus.  If it does not reach, a piece of colon will be removed and utilized to make it reach. This new connection is an Esophagogastric Anastomosis. Lymph nodes in the neck and chest may also be removed and staged. Incisions are closed and a feeding tube is inserted.

**Anesthetic: General with a Regular ETT**  
Thoracic Epidural at T7-T8 unless contraindicated.  
**Induction:** RSI: many patients have a poorly functional Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES) tone and are prone to aspiration.  
**Position:** Supine the entire case. Left arm is tucked and right arm is out. Head is turned to the patient’s right to better expose the left neck. You will eventually have to move the IV pole and IV tubing out of the way so the thoracic surgeon has extra room near the area of the left neck. Protect the airway and really SECURE the ETT. You cannot get to the airway when the surgeon is working over the neck area. Also lubricate, tape and protect the patient’s eyes.  
**IV Access:** 2 large bore IVs. Central line for a CVP is optional (not as common as it used to be).  
**A-Line:** Yes. Consider using the right arm, because the left arm will be tucked.  
**Bowel Prep:** Usually, in case they have to use part of the colon. So the patient may be volume depleted.  
**EBL:** Depends on the surgeon, usually 300-700mLs.  
**NG Tube:** Yes  
**Sudden BP drops:** Seen most often when the general surgeon is advancing the stomach towards the thoracic surgeon. During this manipulation, the bottom portion of the heart is usually compressed and the pressure tends to drop.  
**Duration:** 3-8 hours, depending on the surgeon.  
**EKG leads:** Make sure the left leads are underneath the patient.  
**Warming blanket:** Yes; use a lower body warmer.  
**Fluid warmer:** Yes, the belly is open and you may be giving blood.  
**Neosynephrine Drip:** Yes.  
**Extubation:** Sometimes we prefer to wait until the patient is in the ICU while others may prefer to extubate ASAP. Remember there are fluid shifts, etc. The goal is to extubate within hours.

**Quick note:** Many surgeons will try to spare the vagus nerve branches so there is still acid production and digestive functions.  
   
**Possible Complications**  
Hemorrhage  
Damage to vagus nerve branches.  
Damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.
