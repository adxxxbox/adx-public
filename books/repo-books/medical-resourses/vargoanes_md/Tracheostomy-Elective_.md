Pediatric Tracheostomy (elective)   

## Pediatric Tracheostomy (elective)

**_Edited by Rachel Gray, CRNA, MSN, New York Presbyterian, Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital._**

**Indications:** prolonged mechanical ventilation or upper airway obstruction (tracheal web, subglottic stenosis)

**What information you need from PICU with transfer of care:**  
Specifics you need to know should include:

ETT size, depth @ lip, volume of air in the cuff, blade used & ease/grade view of DL if known.

IV access & fluid status.  
Vasoactive drips & stability of patient.  
Weight.  
Allergies.

Antibiotic coverage & schedule - anything due? If so, send with the patient?

Current vent settings.

How is patient sedated: Infusion(s) or timed IV bolus? Any neuromuscular blockade?

**Transport to/from PICU:**

Depending on your facility, you will either meet the PICU staff just outside the OR with the patient in a unit bed or you will be required to pick up the patient yourself in the unit.  

**If you are required to transport, here is a checklist of elements to transport safely:**

EKG, BP, pulse ox and transport monitor.  
**  
Airway Equipment:  
**Ambu bag & mask w/ full O2 tank.  
Laryngoscope/appropriate blade.  
Oral airway, current size ETT + ½ size down (in case of edema).  
Tape.  
  
**Meds you should also bring with you:**  
Primed “anesthesia” IV tubing.  
Bolus Medications including emergency meds (pressors), propofol or etomidate,  
Flush syringes.  
Neuromuscular blocker.  
Versed and fentanyl.  
  
**Personnel:** Adequate staff to safely transport the patient: usually 3 people: at best it is someone from Anesthesia, Nursing services, and a care tech or OR attendant.

**Additional Transport Information**  
Most of the time, these patients are already intubated on a ventilator with some sort of sedation infusion protocol in place (Versed or fentanyl, Precedex, propofol, and possibly rocuronium).  
Depending on the facility’s policies regarding the transfer of a controlled substance infusion, it can be simpler to continue the existing infusions. You may decide, however, to discontinue everything; it’s your choice. I usually discontinue everything and administer my own. It easier to leave all the controlled substances drips back in the ICU and not worry about them.  
I always administer Versed & a muscle NDMR when I assume care of the patient.  
  
Also, when transporting an intubated pediatric patient, always be very cognizant of ETT depth and ascertain that ETT is well secured. Pinch the base of the ETT between your 1st finger & thumb and gently stabilize your hand against the patient’s head as you transport. Usually it is best for one person at the head to manage the airway and a 2nd person pushes the bed & IV pole.

**When you arrive to the operating room with the patient:**

**Position:** Supine with the arms tucked, so be confident in your IV access. You may want a small lumen extension line to reduce dead space for boluses in these tiny patients. Consider a shoulder roll if the surgeon prefers one. Always be mindful of ETT position with head/neck extension in tiny patients and place EKG leads on the patient’s back away from the surgical area.

**Important:** Make sure you can quickly gain access to the ETT tape and pilot balloon when it’s time to withdraw the ETT in mid-procedure.

**Anesthesia:** General with either TIVA or inhalation.

**Duration:** 30-60 minutes.  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** Patient already has one. Flush and check the IV line patency before you leave the NICU/PICU with the patient if you are involved in the transportation to the O.R.  
You don't need a large bore IV, just functional.  
PICC line is acceptable for most cases unless you know the patient needs a rapid transfusion.  
PIV, a 24g is passable for infants/small children and a 22g for most other pediatric patients.

**Hydration: 4:2:1 (below is just a common reference)  
**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**A-line:** Not needed  
**Foley:** Not needed

**Procedure:** After skin prep/timeout, the surgeon will take a few minutes for careful dissection down to the trachea.  
**Age Range:** Any  
  
**Ventilation:** As long as there is no leak (for an example, if your Peak Inspiratory Pressure is 20 but the ETT leaks at 15mmHg, you can safely use a higher FiO2 to start. Make sure you are standing vigilant at the drapes and that the surgeon lets you know when he/she gets close to the trachea. That is when you will decrease the FiO2 to 30% or less to avoid the potential of an airway fire.

Once the trachea is incised, you will have a large leak. Hand ventilate the patient now.  
Shortly thereafter, surgeon will ask you to slowly withdraw the ETT to allow space to insert the trach tube distal to the tip of the ETT. Once the trach tube is in place, you will disconnect the anesthesia circuit from the ETT and quickly hand it to the surgeon over the drapes to connect to the new trach. Immediately check for ETCO­2 on the monitor to verify proper trach position and air exchange.

The surgeon will then secure the trach with sutures and a trach collar. Your case is now over!

**Possible Complications:**  
Airway fire.  
Prolonged desaturation.  
Bleeding.

**For post-op transport back to PICU:**

Ensure adequate Versed for amnesia and a NDMR before you turn your inhalation agent off. Also have the trach obturator and a back-up trach available with your transport.

It is always safe to transport the patient back to PICU with all the meds and safety airway equipment you originally brought with you to pick up the patient. It never hurts to be safe.
