Laryngoscopy –Direct and Microlaryngoscopy (Rigid Laryngeal Endoscopy)     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Laryngoscopy –Direct and Microlaryngoscopy (Rigid Laryngeal Endoscopy)

**Common anesthesia (always check with the surgeon (pre-op).**  
Position monitor cords and circuit for easy bed rotation.  
Usually, 6.0 MLT ETT  
Muscle relaxation for > 20 minutes, reverse with sugammadex.  
Rotate bed  
Low FiO2 when using a laser.  

This procedure is an endoscopic examination of the pharynx, hypopharynx and larynx by a rigid, lighted laryngoscope. This is a usually a very stimulating short procedure.  
However, it usually involves another procedure besides just viewing the glottis.   
**Indications:** To have a better visualization of the larynx to discover the cause of a hoarseness of voice that cannot be done in the office. Also treatment of the following:  
Removal of foreign bodies.  
Biopsy, removal of benign lesions of larynx, e.g. papilloma, fibroma, vocal nodule, polyp or cyst.  
Injection of Teflon paste in the vocal cords in cases of vocal cord palsy.  
Dilation of subglottic stenosis.  
Insertion of laryngeal stent.  
Arytenoidectomy in cases of abductor cord palsy.

  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT (4.0- 6.0mm).  
Standard ETTs of 4.0-6.0mm tend to be too short for the adult trachea, with a low-volume cuff that will exert high pressure against it.   
However, a 4.0- 6.0-mm microlaryngeal tracheal (MLT) tube (Mallinckrodt Critical Care) is the same length as an adult tube. It has a disproportionately large high-volume low-pressure cuff, and is stiffer and less prone to compression than a regular ETT.  
6.0mm ETT is the most popular for this procedure.  
  
**What if the surgeon requests NO ETT?**  
Pre-oxygenate well with a mask. Have O2 tubing available to connect to the surgeon’s rigid scope to oxygenate the patient once the laryngoscopy begins. Many CRNAs administer 30mg of Ketamine with some Propofol when the surgeon is ready. You must be careful here. The patient will possibly be apneic during the exam. Ask the surgeon to do a chin lift during his or her exam and laryngoscopy. Don’t overload the patient with narcotics and Propofol. Ketamine works very well to keep the patient breathing if you can work in .25 mcgs/kg early in the induction.

**Nitrous Oxide:** If using an electrocautery**,** then avoid because NO supports combustion.  
**Muscle Relaxant:** Ask the surgeon. Sometimes yes, because profound muscle paralysis is needed for introduction of the suspension laryngoscope and to create an immobile surgical field.  
**Succinylcholine Drip:** Very rare. It was once popular, but not anymore because it induces diffuse myalgia and elevated K levels. I still hear of some CRNAs using this drip. A Succinylcholine Drip has the potential of developing a phase II block during unexpectedly long procedures.

**Sux Drip Rate:** 2.5-4.3mg / min.    
**Mouth guard or gauze pads:** yes, the teeth need to be protected. Ask the surgeon what size ETT size he/she wants.  
**LTA Kit:** Recommended; it makes a huge difference in diminishing the gag reflex.  
**Anti-sialagogue:** Yes, Robinul 0.1-0.2 mg IV pre-emergence or 0.2-0.3mg IM 1h pre-op.    
**Decadron:** Yes, 4-12mg.

**Tape ETT:** Usually in the middle and not extremely secure because sometimes the surgeon untapes the ETT and will move the ETT from side to side in the mouth during  the case. Make sure cuff has sufficient volume. For a 10cc cuff volume, at least 5 ccs of air should be placed. Most people will put 2-3 ccs in the cuff and then wonder why the ETT falls out when the surgeon manipulates the head or the ETT.

**Position:**  
The patient is in Boyce position with flexion of the cervical spine and extension of the atlanto-occipital joint. Supine with the bed rotated 90 degrees. Make sure you have circuit tubing slack and your tubing holder is out of the surgeon’s field. It helps to have all your lines already isolated to the appropriate side so you are not scrambling to make adequate circuit tubing longer at the last second.

**FIO2:** Decrease to 0.3 (30%) if an electrocautery is being used, to decrease the risk of airway fire.

**Procedure:** First the surgeon inserts a mouth guard. Then he/she inserts a large rigid laryngoscope (Jako or Dedo). Sometimes the surgeon uses a self-retaining laryngoscope holder to free up his/her hands. This is all very stimulating so be prepared for a hypertensive response.

**Prevent/Treat the Hypertension and Tachycardia:**

BP and HR often fluctuate strikingly during these procedures due to a series of stress-filled laryngoscopies and intubations, separated by varying periods of minimal surgical stimulation. You may have alternating intervals of hypertension and hypotension. Make sure everything you use is very short acting.

Turn your Sevoflurane up.  
Consider 0.5mg/kg Esmolol just prior to direct laryngoscopy.  
Consider small boluses of Propofol.  
Remifentanil would be optimal. Starting at 0.5-1mcg/kg/min at least 8 minutes before the start of the procedure. The easiest way is to just start the drip before induction.

  
**Duration:** 5-40 minutes. Some docs will tell you they just want a quick look and don’t want the patient intubated. You should have your Propofol and an oral airway available in case the procedure takes a little longer. Be careful treating hypertension or tachycardia with fentanyl because the case can be over with quickly.  
**Drops in SaO2:**  
Most of the time the surgeon works around the ETT by displacing it anteriorly and posteriorly with the rigid laryngoscope.  
Sometimes the surgeon may repeatedly extubate and reintubate the patient. You need to inform him when the SaO2 <90%.

It may become more difficult to quickly return the SaO2 back to normal if your FIO2 is 0.3 (30%). You will probably have to aggressively manually ventilate and keep the patient deep at the same time.  
 

**Complications:**  
Damage to lips, tongue, teeth and other surrounding structures.

Damage to cervical spine due to the Boyce position.

Manipulation of the larynx can cause vagal stimulation.

**More Notes**

**Flexible Laryngoscopy**  
This procedure is often done in the office with the patient sitting up and wide awake. The surgeon will use a slender flexible endoscope after spraying some topical anesthetic into and through the nares. Images are usually recorded on video.

**Rigid Laryngoscopy.** Viewing the glottis in "crisp detail." Rigid laryngoscopy provides the clearest magnified view of the glottis.  Images are usually recorded on video.

**Also called:**  
Telescopic Laryngoscopy.  
Transoral Laryngoscopy.
