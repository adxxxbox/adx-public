Bivalirudin (Angiomax)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Bivalirudin (Angiomax)

**Class: Direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI)  
(See direct thrombin inhibitor section)  
_Note: Heparin is an indirect bivalent thrombin inhibitor._  
(See direct thrombin inhibitor section)  
Alternative anticoagulant for HIT.  
  
Bivalent DTIs** (such as desirudin, and lepirudin) block thrombin at 2 sites—the active (catalytic) site and exosite 1 (fibrinogen-binding site).

**Direct Thrombin Inhibitors (DTIs)**  
Bivalirudin (Angiomax)  
Lepirudin (Refludan)  
Argatroban (Acova)  
Dabigatran (Pradaxa)  
  
**Parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors:** argatroban and bivalirudin  
  
**Advantage of bivalirudin over other DTIs:  
**It has a short half-life and partial drug removal with hemofiltration.  
  
Quick onset of action  
Short half-life  
Very predictable  
Does not require reversal  
  
_After stopping infusion, its anticoagulant effects reverse rapidly, with coagulation times approaching baseline within 1 to 2 hours._  
  
**Direct thrombin inhibitor  
Note:** Thrombin is the principal enzyme of hemostasis. It catalyzes the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and activates procoagulant factors V, VIII, XI, and XIII, activation of protein C; and platelet aggregation.  
  
Bivalirudin (Angiomax) is a non-heparin anticoagulant commonly used as an alternative to heparin for certain procedures in those patients for whom heparin is contraindicated, such as patients with heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).  
  
**Bivalirudin (Angiomax)** _replacing heparin as the current standard anticoagulant used in PTCAs._  
_There is no risk for_ _Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia/Heparin Induced Thrombosis-Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (HIT/HITTS) with Angiomax._  
  
**Indications:** For patients undergoing PCI with, or at risk of, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis syndrome (HITTS). For percutaneous coronary intervention (PCIs) with provisional use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor.  
For unstable angina in patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).For the above indications, bivalirudin is intended for use with aspirin (300-325 mg/day)  
  
**Mechanism of Action:  
**Binds to thrombin and prevents the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin during the coagulation cascade. Inhibition of fibrinogen conversion to fibrin inhibits thrombus development. Inhibits both free and clot-bound thrombin and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation.  
  
**Note:** Thrombin is the principal enzyme of hemostasis. It catalyzes the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and activates procoagulant factors V, VIII, XI, and XIII, activation of protein C; and platelet aggregation.  
  
**Bivalirudin (Angiomax)** **inhibits:**  
Both circulating and clot-bound thrombin  
Thrombin-mediated platelet activation  
Platelet aggregation  
  
**Lab Monitoring:** There is no therapeutic drug monitoring widely available for thrombin inhibitors. aPTT can be utilized.  
The **ecarin clotting time,** although not in general clinical use, would be the most appropriate monitoring test.  
  
**Optional monitoring in the hospital setting  
aPTT:** infusion of Argatroban up to 40 mcg/kg/min is well correlated with the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)  
**aPTT:** Commonly monitored with IV administration for titration with HIT patients.  
**ACT:** Commonly monitored in selected cardiac procedures (PCIs).  
**INR and PT:** Prolonged but may not correlate with levels of Bivalirudin.  
**Thrombin Time:** Usually correlates well with thrombin inhibitors though not well studied.  
  
**Bivalirudin’s short half-life**  
Because of its very short half-life (25 minutes), bivalirudin initially stops the thrombin from forming a thrombus, and then allows a rapid return of this function after the procedure, when femoral or other sheaths are to be removed and hemostatic ability is needed.  
  
**Bivalirudin temporarily inhibits the aggregation of platelets, but not their activation.  
  
****Pharmacokinetics  
T1/2:** 25 mins  
**T1/2 with creatinine clearance (CrCl) 10-29 mL/min** ~ 57 minutes**Duration:** ~ 1 hr after infusion discontinued  
**Protein Bound:** Minimal  
**Clearance:** 60-89 mL/min; reduced in severe renal impairment  
**Metabolism:** blood proteases  
**Excretion:** renal  
**Dialyzable:** yes-partially  
  
**Clearance:** by a combination of renal mechanisms and proteolytic cleavage  
Normal renal function (≥ 90 mL/min) = 25 minutes  
Mild renal dysfunction (60–89 mL/min) = 22 minutes  
Moderate renal dysfunction (30-59 mL/min) = 34 minutes  
Severe renal dysfunction (≤ 29 mL/min) = 57 minutes  
Dialysis-dependent = 3.5 hours  
  
Clearance is reduced approximately 20% in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment and by 80% in dialysis-dependent patients.  
  
**Bivalirudin as a heparin replacement**  
Bivalirudin can also be used as a replacement for heparin in cases of HIT and can be administered with GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors during PCI in those cases.  
Heparin prevents the formation of clot by reacting with thrombin.  
However, heparin does not work against clot-bound thrombin.  
An existing thrombus recruits additional platelets to develop more clot.  
Bivalirudin not only works on the thrombin site at the platelet level in the circulation, but also on the thrombin that is bound to an existing clot. The “call for reinforcements” is stopped.  
  
**Bivalirudin’s advantage over heparin.**  
Bivalirudin has a much shorter half-life than heparin and does NOT require reversal.Therefore, once the procedure is over, bivalirudin can be discontinued.  
Sheaths can be removed 2 hours after the infusion is discontinued.  
_This DOES NOT apply to patients with severe renal function or on dialysis._  
**  
Bivalirudin and ACTs  
**aPTT and ACT can be used, but ACT is generally ONLY used to confirm that bivalirudin has been received during interventional cardiology.  
Standard ACT tests have a poor correlation to bivalirudin levels, leading to uncertainty regarding adequate anticoagulation in PCI patients.  
  
**Bivalirudin and aPTT**  
aPTT is known to be more accurate.  
Bivalirudin (Angiomax) appears to be an exception to the rule of thumb that there is usually no therapeutic drug monitoring widely available for DTIs, in contrast with warfarin (INR) and heparin (aPTT).  
  
**Ecarin clotting time:** although not in general clinical use, would be the most appropriate monitoring test.  
The accurate monitoring of bivalirudin levels needs further investigation and development. This also applies to post-procedure results. Studies have shown that sheath removal after 2 hours is safe and effective.  
  
**Route:** parenteral IV in the hospital setting.  
  
**Dosing  
Patients who do not have HIT/HITTS**  
**Bolus:** 0.75 mg/kg IV, and then IMMEDIATELY 1.75 mg/kg/hr IV infusion for duration of PCI/PTCA procedure.  
ACT should be measured 5 minutes after administering the bolus.  
An additional IV bolus of 0.3 mg/kg should be given if needed.  
  
**Patients who have HIT/HITTS**  
**Bolus:** 0.75 mg/kg IV, and then IMMEDIATELY 1.75 mg/kg/hr IV infusion for duration of PCI.  
Ongoing treatment post procedure–may continue infusion following PCI/PTCA for up to 4 hours after the procedure at clinician’s discretion.  
  
**Patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)**  
Consider continuing of the infusion at a rate of 1.75 mg/kg/hr following PCI/PTCA for up to 4 hr post procedure to mitigate risk of stent thrombosis.  
After 4 hours, an additional IV infusion may be initiated at a rate of 0.2 mg/kg/hr, for up to 20 hours, if needed.  
There is no risk for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia/Heparin Induced Thrombosis-Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (HIT/HITTS) with Angiomax.  
  
**Patients with Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia  
****Initial:** 0.15-0.2 mgkg/hr IV; adjust to aPTT to 1.5-2.5 times baseline value  
  
**Dosage modifications**  
**Renal impairment Bolus Dose -** No reduction required for any degree of renal impairmentModerate (CrCl 30-59 mL/min): 1.75 mg/kg/hrSevere (CrCl <30 mL/min): 1 mg/kg/hr Hemodialysis: 0.25 mg/kg/hr.  
  
**Dosing Considerations**  
Safety and effectiveness have not been established in patients with acute coronary syndromes who are not undergoing PTCA or PCI.  
**Renal patients:** Clearance was reduced in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment and in dialysis-dependent patient.  
  
**Hepatic Impairment -** Dose adjustment not necessary.  
  
**Contraindications  
**Active major bleeding  
Hypersensitivity  
  
**Antidote:** None currently available  
rFVIIa (Activated recombinant factor seven)  
25% may be removed by dialysis.  
In a few documented cardiothoracic surgery cases at UCDMC, low dose rFVIIa (1-2 mg) was able to decrease ACT and slow bleeding within the surgical field.  
  
After stopping infusion, its anticoagulant effects reverse rapidly, with coagulation times approaching baseline within 1 to 2 hours.
