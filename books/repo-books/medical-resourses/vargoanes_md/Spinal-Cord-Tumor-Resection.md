Spinal Cord Tumor Resection     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Spinal Cord Tumor Resection

Surgery may include partial or complete tumor resection. An incision is made over the desired vertebrae and the ligaments joining the vertebra. The lamina is removed by laminectomy. This gives the surgeon a clear view of the nerve root and the tumor.

The tumor is excised and the nerve root is pushed back towards the center of the spinal cord. Sometimes the vertebrae have been damaged and a fusion may be required. The incision is closed with the support of the back muscles, which now directly protect the nerve roots.  
**Surgeon’s Goal:** Cause as little damage to the normal spinal cord as possible.

**Pre-op:** Check for neurological deficits: motor, sensory.   
**Anesthetic:** General /ETT

**Duration:** Depends on the tumor location and size; best estimate is 2-4 hours.

**Position:** Usually prone or posterior-lateral.  
**EBL:** Depends on the vascularity of the tumor. Tumor procedures have the potential to bleed a lot.  
**Nerve Monitoring:** Almost always.  
**IV Access:** 2 18G. Make sure the IV site is not an AC site. It may kink when the arms are flexed 90 degrees. This is not an issue if the arms are tucked.  
**A-line:** Sometimes; this depends on how vascular the tumor is.  
**Antibiotics:** Usually Ancef, unless contraindicated.  
**Neuro Monitoring:** Yes.  
**Type and Crossed:** Usually, or Type and Screened.

**Notes and Facts:**

The most common tumors developing from tissues within the spinal cord are known as astrocytomas or ependymomas.  
  
Primary spinal cord tumors are those that originate in the spinal cord itself. These include astrocytomas, glioblastomas, ependymomas and hemangioblastomas.

Tumors may also develop from the supporting tissues of the spinal cord and nerves, such as schwannomas, neurofibromas, or meningiomas. The majority of these tumors are benign, and spread beyond the spinal canal is extremely rare. Due to the compressive effect on the neural elements, however, these lesions can produce significant neurological deficits.

A midline incision is made overlying the tumor. The dura is opened parallel to the long axis of the spine to expose the spinal cord and nerves. Using a microscope, the tumor is dissected free from the surrounding normal structures.

**Metastatic Spinal Tumors:**

These tumors are becoming increasingly common as the number of cancer survivors grow. It is estimated that vertebral masses develop in approximately 40% of cancer patients and 10% to 20% have spinal cord compression. Metastatic spinal tumors can cause fractures, pain, and neurologic dysfunction from spinal cord compression.

**Possible Complications:**

Hematomas  
Hemorrhage  
Neurological Myelopathy
