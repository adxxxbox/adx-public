Gastric Banding - Adjustable Lap Band     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Gastric Banding - Adjustable Lap Band

An adjustable silicone band is placed around the fundus of the stomach. Squeezed by the silicone band, the stomach becomes a pouch with an outlet about an inch wide. The inner lining of the band contains an inflatable balloon that is connected to an access port that is inserted subcutaneously on the patient’s abdomen. The access port can be inflated or deflated, thereby adjusting the stomach size as needed. After banding, the stomach can only hold about an ounce of food.

Besides an elevated BMI, many of these patients also have DM type II (so be thinking about Diabetic Gastroparesis) and OSA.

**Anesthetic:** General with an ETT and RSI with Sellick’s maneuver. Believe it or not, most of these patients are easy intubations. Some CRNAs still insist on inserting blankets under the patient’s shoulders to obtain an optimal sniffing position.   

**Duration:** From 45 minutes to 2 hours. Depends on the surgeon.

**Position:** Supine with a steep reverse Trendelenburg. The patient is securely strapped and a surgical bed attachment called a foot plate is placed on the bed.  
**Ventilation:** When you combine a pneumoperitoneum which decreases respiratory compliance with obesity, you can expect elevated peak pressures. Despite being in reverse Trendelenburg to counter this, the patient may still require PCV mode and you should always add PEEP.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable. Start hydrating early in PACU due to their bowel preps.

**EBL:** Minimal.

**OGT:** Yes; the stomach needs to be emptied.  
**Bowel Prep:** Yes; expect a volume depleted patient.

**Neo Drip:** Usually, reverse Trendelenburg and being dry is not good for blood pressure.  
**Bougie:** Usually not required.  
**Emergence:** Elevate the HOB or keep the patient in a reverse Trendelenburg. Many of these patients still desaturate due to a poor respiratory reserve. Large manual breaths (tidal volumes) with inspiratory holds for pulmonary recruitment will increase the patient’s FRC. These will counteract the desaturations during emergence.   

  
**Possible Complications:** band slippage, pouch dilation, stomach prolapse, obstruction, dysphagia, reflux, band erosion, erosive esophagitis, port leakage, tubing disconnection and malfunction.

The initial mortality is 1% along with 4% incidence of both difficult intubation and postoperative respiratory failure.
