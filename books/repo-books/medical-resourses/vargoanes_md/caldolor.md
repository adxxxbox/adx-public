# Caldolor (Ibuprofen) IV

**Generic Name:** Ibuprofen  
FDA approved 2009  
**Class:** NSAID  
Caldolor is now the 2nd NSAID we can give IV (Toradol being the 1st).  
First injectable Rx for pain and fever approved in the US.  
Has anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties.  
Useful to patients who ca not take oral ibuprofen.  
  
**MOA:** Reversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 and 2 (COX-1 and 2) enzymes, which result in decreased formation of prostaglandin precursors.  
**Cox-1 Inhibition:** Responsible for Renal, GI and bleeding effects.  
**Cox-2 Inhibition:** Achieve analgesia, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties.  
Caldolor inhibits Cox-1 300x LESS than Toradol (300x less bleeding).  
**Bleeding:** Caldolor has had no signals associated with GI bleeding or renal adverse effects.  
  
**Doses:**  
**Analgesia:** 400 or 800mg q6h as needed.  
**Antipyretic:** 400mg followed by 400mg q4-6h or 100 mg to 200 mg q4h as needed.  
**Max Dose:** 3,200mg total daily dose  
**Infusion time:** Recommended over 30mins. However, it was safely infused in healthy volunteers over 5-7 minutes and reached peak plasma concentrations within minutes.  
  
**Dosage Formulation** Caldolor is available as a 400 mg and 800 mg vials.  
**Indications:** Analgesia for mild to moderate pain.  
In adjunct to narcotics for moderate to severe pain.  
Antipyretic - to reduce fever in adults.  
  
**When should it be given:** Pre-induction is optimal  
Pre-, intra and post op  
Clinical findings have demonstrated a 19-22% decrease in morphine doses within the first 24 hours after some surgeries. Studies have also demonstrated effective temperature reductions in febrile patients.  
Caldolor is 20x more expensive than generic IV Toradol.  
  
**Advantages**  
Only IV antipyretic on the market  
Alternate IV NSAID analgesic to Toradol  
Reduction of postoperative opioid use  
Can be used if prolonged NSAID therapy is needed (ketorolac use limited to 5 days)  
  
**Disadvantages**  
Must be diluted and should be given over 30 minutes due to risk of hemolysis.  
Superior efficacy is not supported by published literature.  
Only good for 24h after it is diluted.  
Cannot be administered IM (ketorolac can be given both IM and IV)  
  
**Contraindications:**  
Known hypersensitivity to Ibuprofen or other NSAIDs. Patients who experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. NEVER give during a CABG.  
  
**Adverse Effects:**  
Nausea, flatulence, vomiting, headache, hemorrhage, and dizziness (>5%). The most common reason for discontinuation due to an adverse event in clinical trials of Caldolor pruritus (<1%).  
**Drug Interactions**  
**Aspirin:** When administered with aspirin, the protein binding of ibuprofen is reduced, but the clearance of free ibuprofen is not altered. Concomitant use of Caldolor and aspirin is not generally recommended due to the potential for increased adverse effects (e.g. GI bleeding).  
**ACE inhibitors:** NSAIDs may reduce the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors.  
**Lasix and thiazide:** Ibuprofen can reduce the natriuretic effects of lasix and thiazide in some patients, which has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.  
**Lithium:** NSAIDs have produced elevations of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance of lithium decreased by 20%. This effect has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID.  
**Methotrexate:** NSAIDs may enhance methotrexate toxicity.  
**Official Insert Warning Below:**  
  
**WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR AND GASTROINTESTINAL EVENTS**  
  
**Cardiovascular Risk**  
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal. Risk may increase with duration of use.  
Caldolor is contraindicated for the treatment of peri-operative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.  
  
**Gastrointestinal Risk**  
NSAIDs increase the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including bleeding, ulceration and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. Events can occur at any time without warning symptoms. Elderly patients are at greater risk.
