Solu-Cortef (Hydrocortisone)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Solu-Cortef (Hydrocortisone)

It contains hydrocortisone sodium succinate as the active ingredient.  
**Class:** Corticosteroid and glucocorticoid  
\- Anti-inflammatory/anti-allergic  
\- Membrane stabilizer  
  
Naturally occurring and synthetic glucocorticoids are adrenocortical steroids that are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  
  
Solu-Cortef is often administered as a “stress dose” intraoperatively in patients with a recent history or currently taking steroids by anesthesia providers.  
  
\- Any patients on or have recently been taking steroids should be dosed (stress dose) perioperatively with 100 mg of Solu-Cortef to prevent a possible perioperative shock (cardiovascular collapse) due to secondary corticosteroid insufficiency.  
\- However, the occurrence is <1%.  
  
For Intravenous or Intramuscular Administration  
Most vials consist of 100 mg.  
  
**Doses for Solu-Cortef:  
Common intraoperative stress dose:** 100 mg IV bolus  
**Standard Dose:** 100mg IV bolus  
**Peds:** 1-2mg/kg/dose  
  
**Pediatric patients:  
**\- The initial dose may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated.  
\- The range of initial doses is 0.56 to 8 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (20 to 240mg/m2bsa/day).  
**Geriatric Use:  
**\- Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.  
\- In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardia function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.  
  
**Caution with:**  
**People with diabetes:** Increases blood sugar  
**Infected patients:** Delays wound healing.  
**  
Indications:**  
\- Acute renal insufficiency  
\- Control of severe or incapacitating allergic conditions  
\- Drug hypersensitivity reactions  
\- Replacement for surgery for patients on chronic steroids.  
\- Shock  
\- Status Asthmaticus  
\- Atopic and contact dermatitis  
\- Serum sickness  
\- Transfusion reactions  
\- Inflammatory disorders  
  
**Exogenous steroids and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis:**  
\- Patients with a recent history or currently taking steroids may have a suppressed HPA axis via negative feedback resulting in a tertiary adrenal insufficiency (AI).  
\- With AI, the adrenal cortex cannot secrete a sufficient amount of cortisol in times of stress.  
\- The inability of a suppressed HPA axis to secrete enough cortisol during the stress of surgery can result in cardiovascular collapse.  
\-Therefore, anesthesia providers usually administer a stress dose (supraphysiologic dose) of a glucocorticoid steroid to prevent this dilemma.\- Refer to _“Steroid Stress Dosing-Perioperative Review” for details.  
_**Pregnancy:** Teratogenic Effects  
\- There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on pregnant women.\- Corticosteroids are teratogenic in many species when given in doses equivalent to the human dose.  
\- Animal studies in which corticosteroids have been given to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits have yielded an increased incidence of cleft palate in the offspring.  
\- Corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.  
\- Infants born to mothers who have received corticosteroids during pregnancy should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism.  
  
**Nursing Mothers:  
**\- Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects.  
\- Because of the potential for severe adverse reactions in nursing infants from corticosteroids, a the decision should be made whether to continue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.  
  
**Side effects of excessive steroids:**  
\- Hyperglycemia  
\- Impaired wound healing  
\- Immunosuppression  
\- Wound healing  
\- HTN  
\- Fluid overload  
\- Psychosis and aseptic necrosis of the femoral head.
