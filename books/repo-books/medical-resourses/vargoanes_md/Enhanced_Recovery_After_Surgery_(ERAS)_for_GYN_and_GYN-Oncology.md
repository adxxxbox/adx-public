### Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) for GYN and GYN/Oncology

**Note:** ERAS protocols vary among institutions.  
  
Identify/Confirm case posting for ERAS protocol.**  
  
Room set-up and preparation  
Medications to draw up:  
**Midazolam (Versed®) 2mg IV  
100 mcg FentanylIV acetaminophen (Ofirmev®) (if patient has not received oral acetaminophen pre-op)  
10mg Decadron  
50mg of ketamine (around 0.5mg/kg) with induction, then 10mg Q 1 hour  
Propofol  
Muscle relaxants  
Neosynephrine bag  
Antibiotic prophylaxis per protocol  
  
**Equipment:**  
Non Invasive CO monitor and patient attachments.  
60 mL LR Flush syringe (patient IV tubing will be connected to a pump)  
**  
Equipment for TAP blocks:**  
Ultrasound for TAP blocks (For OPEN cases only)  
4” & 6” block needle and (2) vials 0.25% bupivicaine 1:200K epinephrine (if TAP blocks indicated)  
  
**Ambulatory care unit (ACU) hand-off  
**Review chart to determine if the patient has taken celocoxib (Celebrex®) or acetaminophen (Tylenol®). Avoid acetaminophen (Ofirmev®) and ketorolac (Toradol®) if already taken.  
Standard pre-procedure check-off  
Attach CO noninvasive disposable leads (or do it in the room) to patient  
ERAS post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) prophylaxis (scopolamine)   
ERAS multimodal analgesics (gabapentin)  
Confirm patient received 1,000 mL IV fluid bolus  
Limit pre-op sedation (goal > 2mg midazolam IV)  
Confirm deep venous thrombosis (VTE) /deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis (sequential compression device / subcutaneous heparin if indicated  
Confirm that perioperative glycemic control order set has been activated (if diabetic patient)  
  
**Intraoperative: Prior to incision**  
60 ml syringe of normal saline for flush  
Administer antibiotic  
IV acetaminophen (Ofirmev®) 1 g IV (15 mg/kg) if acetaminophen not administered pre-op  
Administer Ofirmev 1 g IV (15 mg/kg)  
Administer Dexamethasone 10 mg IV   
Administer Ketamine 0.5mg/kg IV and 10mg Q 1 hour  
Follow ERAS fluid protocol 3mL/kg/hour for laparoscopic.  
5ml/kg/hour for open procedure.  
Forced air warming blanket (after prep and drape).  
**Note:** If not contraindicated, consider induction with rocuronium over succinylcholine to avoid belly breathing during TAP blocks.  
  
**4 QUADRANT TAP blocks for OPEN cases only** : 25% bupivacaine w/1:400,000 epi.  
  
**Intraoperative maintenance  
**Follow ERAS fluid protocol 3mL/kg/hour for laparoscopic  
5ml/kg/hour for open procedure  
500 ml crystalloid bolus or 250 mL of 5% albumin if needed as directed by institutional protocol  
**Note:** Many anesthesia providers start the 500 cc bolus using the pump (flow rate 999 ml/hr with 500ml volume to be infused–VTBI) prior to induction.  
**Ventilator:** Pressure controlled ventilation with tidal volume 6ml/kg.  
**Note:** Many anesthesia providers start the 500 cc bolus thru the pump (flow rate 999 mL/hr with 500mL VTBI) prior to induction.  
**Ventilator:** Pressure control ventilation (6ml/kg TV)  
Attempt to avoid or limit Fentanyl (not to exceed 100 mcg fentanyl).  
**Note:** If not contraindicated, consider induction with rocuronium in preference to succinylcholine to avoid abdominal muscle activity during transverse abdominis plane (TAP) blocks.  
  
**Blood Glucose Monitoring:**  
Baseline check 60 minutes after induction or 60 minutes after the last check in ACU (diabetic patients).  
Diabetic patients- continued glycemic control order set), recheck Q 1hour.  
For non-diabetic patients, check blood glucose within 60 minutes after induction.  
Maintain blood glucose between 100-180 mg/dl.  
Check blood glucose Q2hr (“finger stick” or other sampling technique).  
If blood glucose >180, initiate sliding scale.  
  
**Emergence**  
Ondansetron (Zofran®) 4mg IV  
Ketorolac 15 mg-30 mg IV – ask surgeon prior to emergence.  
Awake Extubation in the OR  
  
**Post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) hand-off  
**Inform PACU RN that ERAS protocol was followed  
Report last blood glucose measurement, time and intervention  
Report last antibiotic dose and time  
Report acetaminophen /ketamine dose and time  
SCDs from PACU arrival until discharge–while in bed or chair.
