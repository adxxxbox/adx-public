### Vitrectomy Indications

**Diabetic Retinopathy**  
Can be non-proliferative or proliferative. DR is the growth of new unhealthy, freely floating bleeding blood vessels within the eye (called vitreal hemorrhage), causing thick fibrous scar tissue to grow on the retina, detaching it. If early office laser treatment is unsuccessful, a Vitrectomy is done to clear the blood. Membranectomy removes scar tissue, and an injection of gas or silicon with a scleral buckle may be needed to return sight. 

**Macular Holes** are tiny holes torn in the central retina due to the aging process which causes the normal shrinking of the vitreous.  These holes have a blind spot which blocks sight.

**Macular Pucker** is a formation of a patch of unhealthy tissue in the macula, distorting vision. Also called epiretinal membrane.  After vitrectomy to remove the vitreous gel, a membranectomy is undertaken to peel away the tissue.

**Retinal Detachment** is when the lining of the eye peels loose and floats freely within the interior of the eye. A vitrectomy is first done to clear the inner jelly. A scleral buckle is done to create a support for the reattached retina. A Membranectomy is then done to remove scar tissue. Then the surgeon performs an injection of dense liquids to smooth the retina into place, photocoagulation to bond the retina back against the wall of the eye, and injects a gas or silicone oil to secure the retina in place as it heals.

**Vitreous Floaters** are deposits of various sizes and shapes consistency, floating within the normal transparent vitreous humour, which can obstruct vision.

**Vitreous hemorrhage** is bleeding in the eye from injuries, retinal tears, subarachnoidal bleedings (as with Terson syndrome), or blocked blood vessels. Once blood is removed, photocoagulation with a laser can shrink unhealthy blood vessels or seal retinal holes.
