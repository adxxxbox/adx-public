Shunt Estimates using Flow Ratio (Qp/Qs)   

## Shunt Estimates using Flow Ratio (Qp/Qs)

Estimating intracardiac and extracardiac shunting in the setting of complex congenital heart disease can be simply obtained in the cardiac cath lab by calculating the Qp/Qs ratio.

**Qp/Qs** \= (SaO2 - SmvO2)  
(SpvO2 –SpaO2)

**Qp** \= pulmonary blood flow  
**Qs** = systemic blood flow  
**SmvO2** = mixed venous oxygen saturation  
**SpvO2** = pulmonary venous oxygen saturation  
**SaO2** = systemic arterial oxygen saturation  
**SpaO2** = PA oxygen saturation

You may see Flow Ratio (Qp/Qs) results in your patient’s chart.  
**Below is what you basically need to know:**

**Flow Ratio (Qp/Qs):**  
<1.0 = indicates right-to-left shunt  
< 1.5 = small left-to-right shunt (1.0-1.5)  
\> or equal to 2.0 = large left-to-right shunt
