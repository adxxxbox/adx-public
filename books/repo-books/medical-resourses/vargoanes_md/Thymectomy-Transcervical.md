### Thymectomy-Trancervical for MG

This procedure is less invasive that allows for removal of the entire thymus gland through a small neck incision just above the sternum.  
Instead of having to stay in the hospital for 5-7of days (sternal approach), the transcervical thymectomy allows the patient to leave the hospital the following day. Unfortunately, not many transcervical thyectomies are performed as compared to other methods that involve going through the chest requiring a double lumen tube.

There are some more extensive Transcervical Thymectomies that do require you to drop the right lung with a DLT. These are the These involve Thymus masses.

The surgeon makes a 1 1/2-inch incision at the bottom of the neck, just above the sternum. No bone is divided and only the skin is cut. A special retractor allows the surgeon to lift the sternum upward to see the thymus gland directly from the neck without the need to open the chest.  

Sometimes we are asled to intermittently suspend ventilation for a reasonable period of time to allow better visualization deep into the mediastinum.

**Anesthetic:** General with a single lumen tube.  
If extensive- double lumen tube.  
**Muscle Relaxants: Anectine:** Avoid **NDMR:** Avoid or give 1/10th the dose that you would give a patient of the same weight.  
Some surgeons want to visualize and feel the motion of the diaphragm as the cautery nears the phrenic nerve while they are deep and lateral. So always check with the surgeon.

**Duration:** 2-4 hours  
**EBL**: 50-100mLs  
**Position:** Supine, shoulder roll with head extended back for neck exposure. Make sure the patient can extend their head back pre-op. Arms tucked.  
**IV Access:** 1 or 2 18g  
**A-line:** Not always required but we still mostly insert one. Consider the  
the left arm. A right Arm A-line there may be intermittent compression of the innominate artery throughout the operation may lead to false determinations of a low blood pressure

**Patient candidates:** Thin patients with thymic hyperplasia and NO thymic masses (Thyomas).   
  
**Contraindications:**  
Previous median sternotomy  
Severe neck osteoarthritis  
previous cervical spine surgery

Previous thyroid surgery- may obscure the upper poles and create difficulty in starting the dissection.

**Possible Complications**  
Phrenic Nerve Injury  
Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury  
Pneumothorax  
Hemorrhage

**More Notes**  
Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune neurologic disease that results when the thymus, a normally dormant gland in the chest begins producing antibodies.  
are directed at the acetylcholine receptor in the neuromuscular junction and lead to a functional and numeric decrease in acetylcholine receptors. So it interferes with the muscles' ability to contract. The symptoms may include droopy eyelids; double vision; weakness in the face, neck, arms and legs; and/or difficulty in swallowing.  

Most experts agree that removing the thymus gland improves the course of the disease by reducing or eliminating the symptoms. However, improvement may take months or years.

The standard approach to thymectomy uses a chest incision and requires an average hospital stay of five to seven days, while the transcervical thymectomy allows the patient to leave the hospital the following day.

The strongest association between thymectomy and an improved clinical course has been seen in female myasthenics with systemic weakness.

The thymus generally remains completely encapsulated and is separated without difficulty from the pericardium. Sometimes adhesions make it necessary to remove a portion of pericardium along with the gland at the site of the adhesion

In most cases the thymus gland is removed in the form of a complete gland with both upper poles and both lower poles intact.

**Surgical approaches** to the removal of the thymus gland:  
Transsternal (through the sternum)  
Transcervical (through a small neck incision)  
Transthoracic (through one or both sides of the chest)
