### Common Questions Asked About Malignant Hyperthermia (MH)

  
_Edited by Dan Lovinaria, DNP, MS, MBA, APRN, CRNA_  
  
**What are the triggering agents for MH?**  
Desflurane  
Isoflurane  
Sevoflurane  
Enflurane  
Halothane  
Methoxyflurane  
Succinylcholine  
  
Nitrous Oxide is not a trigger and is the only anesthetic gas considered safe  
  
**What anesthetic agents are considered safe?  
**Nitrous Oxide  
Barbituates  
Benzodiazepines  
Propofol  
Ketamine  
Nondepolarizing Neuromuscular Blockers (NDMBs)  
Opioids  
Local anesthetics

**How should I manage a patient with a family history of MH?  
**Until proven otherwise, manage the patient as if they are MH susceptible with a non-triggering anesthetic technique.

**Can Calcium gluconate or CaCl be used when treating hyperkalemia cardiac toxicity during an MH crises?  
**Yes  
  
**How much Mannitol is in Dantrolene?**  
**Dantrolene (Dantrium/Revento)**  
There are 3 grams of Mannitol in each vial of 20 mg of Dantrolene (0.15 g mannitol/ 1 mg dantrolene).  
**Ryandodex:** There are 0.125 grams of mannitol in each vial of 250 mg of Ryanodex (0.0005 grams mannitol/1 mg dantrolene).  
  

**Should MH patients be pretreated with dantrolene?**  
Dantrolene proplylaxis is not recommended for most MH-susceptible patients. Dantrolene can worsen muscle weakness in patients with muscle disease and should be used with caution. Therefore, dantrolene prophylaxis may be omitted, provided non-trigerring anesthetics are used, there is appropriate monitoring, and an adequate supply of dantrolene is available.  
  
**Why is it recommended that we stock a minimum of 36 vials of Dantrolene, rather than 12 or 24?**  

To treat an MH episode, an initial dose of dantrolene at 2.5 mg/kg is recommended, with a suggested upper limit of 10 mg/kg. If a patient of average weight (approximately 70 kg) were to require dantrolene at the upper dosing limit, then at least 700 mg of dantrolene would be needed. Thirty six (36) vials of dantrolene will allow for initial stabilization and treatment while more vials are being acquired to continue treatment, as needed.

**Can local anesthesia be used for dental work?**

Yes. All MH-susceptible patients can be safely receive any local anesthetic.

**How should I manage a patient with a family history of MH?**

The family should be referred to a Biopsy Center Director or MH expert associated with MHAUS for discussion of testing options to determine MH susceptibility. Until proven otherwise, manage as if MH susceptible with a non-trigerring anesthetic technique.

**How should the anesthesia machine be prepared before surgery for an MH patient?**

Ensure the anesthesia vaporizers are disabled by removing or taping in the “OFF” position. Flow 10L/min 02 through circuit for at least 20 minutes. During this time as disposable, unused breathing bag should be attached to the Y-piece. The expired gas analyzer will indicate absence of volatile agents in the anesthesia circuit. Changing the C02 absorbent (soda lime or baralyme) is not recommended if these procedures are followed. However newer anesthesia machines may require up to 60 minutes of preparation. Check with the manufacturer of the machine for suggested washout procedure.

**How long should MH susceptible patients be monitored after an uneventful anesthesia?**

The patient susceptible to MH undergoing outpatient surgery may be discharged on the day of surgery if the anesthetic has been uneventful. A minimum of 1 hour in PACU monitoring vital signs at least every 15 minutes and an addition 1 hour in phase 2 PACU / step down unit is recommended.
