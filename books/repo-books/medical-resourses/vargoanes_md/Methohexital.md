# Methohexital

**Methohexital (Brevital)**  
**Class:** Barbiturate  
Induction agent of choice for ECTs because it lowers the seizure threshold.  
Extremely basic (like other barbiturates).  
**Induction Dose:** 1-2.5mg/kg  
**Sedation:** 0.25-1mg/kg  
**Common ECT Dose:** 80mg  
**Onset:** 30 secconds  
**Peaks:** 1-2 minutes  
**Duration:** 5-10 minutes  
**Contraindications:**  
Latent or manifest porphyria.  
Hypersensitivity to barbiturates.  
Not as available as Propofol.  
**Precautions:**in patients in status asthmaticus, debilitated patients or in those with impaired function of respiratory, circulatory, renal, hepatic, or endocrine systems.  
**Side effects:**  
**Cardiovascular:** thrombophlebitis, hypotension, tachycardia, peripheral vascular collapse, and convulsions in association with cardiorespiratory arrest. **Respiratory:** Respiratory depression, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, hiccups, and dyspnea.  
**Neurologic:** Skeletal muscle hyperactivity (twitching), injury to nerves adjacent to injection site, and seizures.  
**Psychiatric:** Emergence delirium, restlessness, and anxiety may occur, especially in the presence of postoperative pain.  
**Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, emesis, abdominal pain, and liver function tests abnormal.  
**Allergic:** Erythema, pruritus, urticaria, and cases of anaphylaxis have been reported rarely.  
**Pain on injection:** yes  
**Allergic Reaction:** 1:30,000  
**Site of Action:** GABA receptors  
**Other Notes**  
Methohexital has a methyl radical that contributes to involuntary skeletal muscle movement (myoclonus). This lowers the seizure threshold.  
Myoclonus is dose dependent and can be reduced with the administration of opioids prior to induction.  
Methohexital have a maximal brain uptake in 30 seconds (meaning prompt onset of CNS depression).  
Then due to rapid redistribution, half of the initial peak concentration is gone within 5 minutes.  
**ECT's:**  
There is a prompt awakening with Methohexital because of a large redistribution from the brain to the inactive tissue.  
Methohexital and Propofol in doses of >1mg/kg will decrease the duration of an ECT seizure by 35-45% as compared to Etomidate.  
**Methohexital** is more rapidly metabolized than Thiopental.  
Hepatic clearance is 3-4 times faster.
