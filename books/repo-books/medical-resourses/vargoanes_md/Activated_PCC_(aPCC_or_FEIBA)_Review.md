### Activated PCC (aPCC or FEIBA) Review

_American Society of Hematology's Choosing Wisely® initiative for 2014 warns against overuse of PCCs in the absence of clinical bleeding._  
  
aPCC is available in the U.S.—a freeze-dried sterile human plasma fraction. It is mixed and can be administered immediately.  
  
FEIBA stands for **F**actor **E**ight (VIII) **I**nhibitor **B**ypassing **A**ctivity (FEIBA).  
It is an activated PCC (aPCC).  
**Do NOT** confuse aPPC with other PCCs.  
PCCs DO NOT have activated clotting factors.  
Kcentra is a popular PCC.  
  
FEIBA was originally developed for patients with severe hemophilia A (involves FVIII) and hemophilia B (involves FIX). Up to 30% of severe hemophilic patients develop inhibitors (antibodies) against either FVIII or XIII.  
This makes treatment difficult because these patients have a poor response when receiving exogenous FVIII or FIX.  
FEIBA was created to bypass these inhibitors of FVIII and FIX and to restore proper coagulation by increasing thrombin further down the coagulation cascade.  
However, PCCs are seldom used to treat inhibitor patients. In the 1990s, recombinant activated FVII (rFVIIa) concentrate were introduced for treatment of inhibitor patients. rFVII also bypasses factor VIII.  
aPCC is now gaining a lot of attention for the off-label treatment of severe hemorrhaging patients on the newer anticoagulants.  
FEIBA improves thrombin generation in all plasmas, EXCEPT factor V-deficient plasma.  
  
**Lab Test for Inhibitors**  
The autoantibody inhibitors are measured with the Bethesda assay or its modifications, and titers are expressed in Bethesda units (BU).  
  
**What is in FEIBA? (Factors 2,7,9,10 and protein C)**  
FVII primarily is an activated form (FVIIa).  
Still has trace amounts of the “activated factors II, IX and X".  
Factor VIII coagulant antigen (F VIII C:Ag).  
Trace amounts of kallikrein-kinin system.  
Zymogen forms of the pro-coagulant factors FII, FVII, FIX, FX.  
Anticoagulant protein C in a balanced ratio of 1 U/1 U FEIBA.  
  
**FEIBA and FDA approval**  
FEIBA was approved for spontaneous bleeding episodes or to prevent bleeding with surgical interventions in hemophilia A and B patients who have inhibitors.  
  
_It has NOT been approved to treat bleeding conditions without inhibitors to Factor VIII or Factor IX._  
  
Today, there is an increase off-label usage as an anticoagulant-reversal agent.  
However, the efficacy and safety of FEIBA in off-label uses remain unsubstantiated.  
  
**Indications:  
****For the use in hemophilia A and B patients with inhibitors for:**  
Control and prevention of bleeding episodes.  
Perioperative management.  
Routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes.  
  
**Not Indicated for:  
**Bleeding episodes resulting from coagulation factor deficiencies in the **absence** of inhibitors to factor VIII or factor IX.  
  
**Onset:** 5-15 minutes - Peak thrombin generation at 15 to 30 minutes in an _in vitro_ assay.  
**Duration:** 8 – 12 hours: Thrombin generation returns to baseline value 8 to 12 hours after a single dose of FEIBA.  
Rebound of anticoagulant effect may be seen around 12 hours; this is why it need re-dose FEIBA.  
  
**Possible Complications** (thrombotic complications)Venous thromboembolism.  
DIC.  
MI.  
PE.  
  
When FEIBA is used for its FDA-approved indication (hemophilia), it is associated with 4-9 thrombotic events for every 100,000 infusions.  
  
**Drug Contraindications  
**Antifibrinolytics - Amicar or Tranexamic Acid should not be used for approximately 6 to 12 hours after the administration of FEIBA to reduce possible thromboembolic events.  
History of anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity to FEIBA or constituents.  
DIC.  
Thrombosis.  
  
**More Notes and Facts for FEIBA  
PCCs vs aPCC (FEIBA)  
**PCCs have been shown to be LESS effective than aPCCs (FEIBA) and to show a higher rate of adverse reactions.  
(Sjamsoedin et al 1981; Lusher et al 1983; Negrier et al 1997).  
  
**Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of FEIBA**  
There is no specific equipment available for monitoring FEIBAs effects.  
However, both thromboelastography (TEG) and thrombin generation assay (TGA) may provide some guidance in the treatment of the individual patient.  
Whole blood clotting time (WBCT), and the aPTT may not correlate with clinical improvement.  
  
**FEIBA vs Vitamin K and FFP  
**_You would need over two liters of FFP to approach similar concentrations of 1 dose of FEIBA.  
_During an emergency bleed, you still must wait for FFP to typed-specific or ABO-compatible and thawed before administering.  
  
With vitamin K antagonists (warfarin), the reversal of anticoagulant effects can be achieved by administering vitamin K and fresh-frozen plasma (FFP).  
However, vitamin K has a delayed onset of action in correcting the INR and plays no role in reversing the anticoagulant effects of newer agents, such as the oral direct thrombin inhibitors or the oral direct factor Xa inhibitors.  
The admiration of FFP is slow because it must be ABO-matched to the patient’s blood and requires time for thawing before it is given (FFP does NOT need cross matched).  
The dose of FFP is 15mL/kg and may lead to volume overloading to sensitive cardiac patients.  
FFP may cause other infusion reactions, such as acute lung injury.  
  
Therefore, emergency life threatening treatment for an anicoagulated patient on Direct Oral Anticoagulants is FEIBA.  
  
**aPCC (FEIBA) vs PCC (Kcentra)**  
aPCCs, in contrast to PCCs, contain activated FVII and small amounts of activated FII, FIX and FX. PCCs have been shown to be less effective than aPCCs and to show a higher rate of adverse reactions.  
aPCC also replaces coagulation factors lowered by warfarin, but not the first choice of treatment.  
aPCC does not neutralize the newer oral anticoagulants, but helps during a severe bleeding episodes.  
aPCC improves thrombin generation in all plasmas, except FV-deficient plasma.  
  
**Depending on institution protocols or situation, FEIBA may be the first option for eminent life threatening bleed in patients taking:**  
Rivaroxaban  
Apixaban  
Edoxaban  
Dabigatran  
  
UCDMC (University of California Davis Medical Center) are one of the few medical facilities with established reversal treatments and protocols for a variety of anticoagulants. UCDMC prefers FEIBA over non-activated PCC for Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOAC) reversal.  
FEIBA is currently the only available aPCC that contains clotting factors - II, IX, and X and VII (FVII primarily in an activated form).  
  
**Dose:** Maximum injection or infusion rate must not exceed 2 units per Kg of body weight per minute.  
_FEIBA is available as a lyophilized powder in a single-use vial containing nominally 500, 1,000 or 2,500 units per vial._  
  
**Preparation of FEIBA  
**FEIBA NF has been prepared from Source Plasma and/or Fresh Frozen Plasma.  
Individual donations of human plasma are combined to form plasma pools.  
Prior to being used for manufacture of FEIBA, each plasma pool is tested for the presence of genome sequences of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2), hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Parvovirus B19 (B19V) using PCR.  
  
**LMWH and Fondaparinux  
**Data is still limited, but aPCC can be used to indirectly reverse the effects of LWMH and fondaparinux. FEIBA may be an option in eminent life threatening bleeding when other modalities have not been successful.  
  
**Drug Contraindications  
**Antifibrinolytics- Amicar or Tranexamic Acid should not be used for approximately 6 to 12 hours after the administration of FEIBA to reduce possible thromboembolic events.  
History of anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity to FEIBA or constituents.  
DIC.  
Thrombosis.  
  
**More Notes**  
Prothombin complex concentrates (PCCs) and activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCCs), plasma-derived products containing FII, FVII, FIX, FX and small amounts of FVIII, have been available for the treatment of inhibitor patients for more than 30 years.  
  
Acquired hemophilia developed autoantibodies (inhibitors) directed against plasma coagulation factors, most frequently factor VIII (FVIII). This type of hemophilia develops late in life with a high morbidity and mortality rate. These autoantibody inhibitors are measured with the Bethesda assay or its modifications, and titers are expressed in Bethesda units (BU).
