### Cochlear Implantation

  
Edited by David Andrews, CRNA, MHS from Portland, OR

The implantation of a computerized electronic device designed to help people with auditory nerve deafness who gain little or no benefit from hearing aids. The device converts sound energy to electric impulses that stimulate the auditory nerve directly.

  
A postauricular incision is made. A small seat is created in the mastoid bone to hold the receiver/stimulator and protect it. The surgeon drills through the mastoid bone to the inner ear. An electrode array is then inserted into the cochlea. The receiver/stimulator is secured to the skull, and the incision is closed with stitches. Typically, patients return home the day of surgery.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
**Positioning:** Supine, head turned laterally with the ipsilateral arm tucked.

**Muscle Relaxation:** Depends on facial nerve monitoring. Ask your surgeon.  
**Duration:** 1-2.5 hours; depends on surgeon.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
**Facial Nerve Monitoring:** Check with surgeon.  
**Emergence:** Smooth is the goal.  
**EBL:** Minimal.  
Consider PONV meds.
