### Pediatric Cardiac Anesthesia for Open Heart Surgery

(Standard set up and considerations)**  
  
Setup:**

-   **Monitors**

-   2 pulse oximeters (pre- & post-ductal)

-   Note: It is a good idea to always have two pulse oximeters on the patient in every case.  
    If one fails, it will be difficult to replace the faulty probe.

-   NIBP, 5 lead EKG
-   Defibrillator EKG, also as deemed necessary

Make sure it is charged and functional.

NIRS (Near infrared spectroscopy)  
2 on head (L & R) if patient is big enough (one for neonate) and 1 on back/flank area

-   **Temp monitoring**

-   Foley temp if patient big enough, or rectal temp probe if smaller patient
-   NP temp probe for a second source of temperature for comparison
-   Note: You will notice on rewarming the temperatures will rise at different rates.  
    Some centers average the two core temps and come off pump at 36.5 C or wait till both NP and Bladder/Rectal temps to reach 36.5 C

-   **Triple transducer** (PEDIATRIC SET if available)

-   De-air and zero lines
-   **Note:** Look for air bubbles just prior to attaching lines to the patient as over time, air bubbles will settle and collect especially in injection ports and at stop cocks. Flush through as you tap those sites prior to connecting lines to patients.

-   **IV fluid sets:** Basic guidelines (may vary)

-   No hanging drips for < ~2kg, use push lines
-   Buretrol for less than 2 years old
-   Straight set for > 2 years old
-   **Note:** Although buretrols are used as a safeguard for accidental overdose of fluids in small patients, if volume or products need to be given quickly, you will need a regular macro drip line.

-   **Pacemaker**

-   Make sure it has a battery and it works prior to start of case

-   **TEE probe**

-   Make sure appropriately sized TEE probe is clean and in room
-   May need two sizes if patient is in between sizes (neo, pedi, adult)

-   **Pharmacy**

-   Commonly Ancef
-   Fentanyl
-   Versed
-   Rocuronium/Vecuronium
-   **Heparin** ~400 units/kg (confirm accurate dose with perfusionist)
-   **Amicar** 100 mg/kg x 2-3 syringes

-   Perfusionist may want dose to prime pump with if < 20kg patient
-   1 st dose prior to incision
-   2 nd dose after protamine has been given

-   **TXA** is used in some institutions instead of Amicar

-   30mg/kg bolus (up to 6 grams) after lines are in
-   2mg/kg to pump
-   10mg/kg/hr infusion started after bolus until skin is closed

-   **Epinephrine:** 1 mcg/ml TB syringe & 10 mcg/ml syringe, maybe 100 mcg/ml syringe (depending on patient weight); typical dose has broad therapeutic range = 1-10 mcg/kg
-   +/- Diluted phenylephrine 8 mcg/ml syringe (typical phenylephrine dose has broad therapeutic range = 1-30 mcg/kg)
-   **Calcium chloride** (typical dose 10-20 mg/kg)
-   **Calcium gluconate** is a dilute form that is safe to use in peripheral lines and should be the drug of choice over CaCl if no central access.

-   Typical dose 30mg/kg titrate to calcium level
-   **Note: Calcium gluconate/chloride** is used in conjunction with blood product administration during the surgery to counter act the effects of the citrate in the blood products.

-   +/- **Nitric oxide** in room if concerns for elevated PVR/RV strain post-bypass
-   Blood in room, checked

-   Typically start with PRBCs and FFPs in the room and Platelets and Cryo will be called for during rewarming as needed

-   **Drips**

-   Dextrose carrier (adjust rate for patient size, usually 3-5 ml/hr)
-   All drips are primed and ready to go on standby
-   May include but not limited to epinephrine, milrinone, dexmedetomidine, calcium chloride, vasopressin, nitroglycerin, and/or nicardipine.
-   Typically, we use syringe pumps with all drip lines connecting to a common multi-port adaptor
-   Connect multi-port adaptor to central line after induction and placement

-   **Induction**

-   Inhalation/IV induction  
    Most pediatric patients without CHD will tolerate inhalation induction without adverse events due to intact cardiac reserve.  
    IV induction is preferred in CHD to mitigate risk of destabilization.

-   Apply remaining monitors on patient ASAP, if any didn’t get applied prior to induction (some pediatric patients do not tolerate monitor application well while awake—do what you can and be safe)
-   **Note:** If patient is at risk of destabilization with inhalational induction, consider PO versed 0.5 to 0.75 mg/kg preopoperatively, bring the sedated patient to the OR, apply all monitors, use N2O to stun further, place PIV, then proceed with IV induction.

-   Intubation

-   Consider nasal intubation in neonates if the plan is to remain intubated post procedure.  
    This allows the neonate to be able to suck and be soothed with a pacifier and less stimulating than oral ETT.

-   PIVs, arterial line, CVL

-   Ultrasound guided placement may be helpful/indicated
-   Femoral lines are not commonly first choice, but are better than nothing

-   Draw baseline ACT and ABG as soon as the A-line is in.
-   Pediatric Cardiologist called to room to perform pre-procedural TEE
-   Give antibiotics and Amicar when nearing incision.  
    If using TXA, give the bolus and start the drip once the central line is in and the multiport adapter is connected.

-   **Going on pump**

-   Surgeon requests heparin (typically after the purse strings are in on the aorta before the atrium)

-   Give via central line, if CVL placed/existing
-   Good practice to aspirate line to confirm patency of CVL (blood return)
-   Communicate clearly to team “\_\_\_ units of heparin going in”
-   Communicate clearly to team when heparin is completely in
-   ACT 3 minutes after heparin dose circulates, draw from CVP line as to not disrupt ABP reading (GOAL ACT FOR CPB > ~400-480)
-   **Note:** Studies show 94% of the ACTs were > 400 at 1 minute.  
    With blood volume being significantly smaller in our smaller patients with much higher cardiac output compared to adult CV patients, some institutions draw the ACT with in the first minute after heparin is given.

-   Be vigilant of SBP for aortic cannulation

-   Goal SBP changes based on patient age
-   Too high = increased risk for aortic dissection!

-   Peds cardiac cases usually use 1 aortic and 2 venous cannulae (watch the field)
-   **“RAPing”** by perfusion is **Reverse Autologous Priming** of the CPB circuit

-   For smaller patients when we want to reduce amount of product exposure
-   **Note:** Some programs prime the pump with blood products to reduce the amount of pump priming solution in the very small patients and more so in the more complex surgeries.

-   Communicate clearly with perfusion about when to stop ventilation when they have reached adequate pump flows

-   Look at their cardiac index flows on the pump to see if they are “full flow” or still need our help oxygenating/ventilating
-   look at their Isoflurane to see if they have their volatile agent on

-   Once on pump, measure urine output (as to measure “pump urine” once off pump)
-   If it’s a circulatory arrest case, once surgeon askes to cool the patient, add ice to the patient’s head.  
    No direct contact between skin and ice to prevent injury.

If patient is on a water mattress, set the mattress temp to 4 C. 

-   **Coming off pump**

-   Rewarming period

-   If it is a hypothermic circulatory arrest case, don’t forget to take the ice off the head and set the water mattress to 40 C.
-   Order blood products
-   **Note:** Blood products for coming off pump should have been ordered prior to starting the case.  
    At this point in the surgery, you would be calling for the blood products to be brought to the room that are not already in the room from the start of the case.
-   Products may include **Platelets 10-20 ml/kg,** **Cryoprecipitate 10-20 ml/kg**
-   **Note:** every open-heart case should start with PRBCs and FFPs in the room in a cooler prior to starting the case.

-   **Discuss drips** with team, prepare nitric oxide if anticipated
-   Start drips after aortic cross clamp is removed (if there was one) and core temp is > 35 degrees Celsius

-   **Note:** Some programs start **Dexmedetomidine, Milrinone, TXA,** and **opioid infusions** in the beginning of the case after the central line is in and the multiport adaptor is connected and continue the drips throughout the entire case.  
    In this scenario, once the surgeon starts rewarming, the **epinephrine drip is started at 0.03 mcg/kg/min** and titrated up or down and off accordingly throughout the rewarming/optimizing period to facilitate weaning from the pump and to finalize the surgery.

-   If aortic cross clamp (ACC) was on and need to de-air heart:

-   Head down position, turning left to right at surgeon request
-   Surgeon will tap heart gently to mobilize air
-   Anesthesia will give a few sizable hand-breaths
-   Surgeon may request holding carotids when ACC is removed

-   Cardiologist will take a quick look at surgical repair with TEE
-   When Perfusionist **MUFs** (see below) you will see the pressure drop

-   Communicate clearly with Perfusion about BP change

-   Is it the **MUF** ? Is the change controlled by Perfusion?
-   **MUF** \= **Modified Ultrafiltration is hemofiltration** with the return of intravascular replacement fluids to compensate for losses; reduces levels of proinflammatory cytokines and total interstitial body water after extracorporeal circulation/bypass.
-   **Note:** you will have to give volume during the MUF and some institutions work in the platelets at this time.
-   Keep up with the calcium as products are transfused.

-   Surgeon will request **protamine** after successfully weaning pump flows

-   **Dose typically 1-1.5mg/kg** (Confirm actual dose with Perfusionist)
-   **Note:** Some programs do not have Perfusionist calculate the protamine dose.  
    4mg/kg can be used (1mg of protamine per 100 units of heparin bolused)
-   Announce “\_\_\_mg of protamine is going in”
-   ALWAYS GIVE PROTAMINE SLOWLY, no matter how little the volume
-   Let team know when protamine is halfway in, watch blood pressure and field

-   **Draw ACT and ABG 3** minutes after protamine circulates

-   Arterial line draw
-   **Can draw the ROTEM** sample at this time

-   Ok to give Amicar AFTER PROTAMINE circulates

-   **Note:** DO NOT give **cryoprecipitate** until AFTER Protamine is in.

-   Perfusion will hand over Cell Saver
-   Give Perfusion total urine output volume while on pump
-   **TEG** after all blood products are given, prior to leaving for CVICU

-   1 blue tube for peds (3-4 ml of blood)
-   2 blue tubes & 1 purple tube for adults (~10 ml of blood)

**Post-op:**  
Consider early extubation if appropriate.  
For early extubations, consider: nonopioid adjuncts like dexmedetomidine infusion 0.5- 1.5 mcg/kg/hr IV  
  
Consider continuing dexmedetomidine drip regardless of extubation plan.  
  
Some programs start a dexmedetomidine drip at 1mcg/kg/hr in the beginning of the case once the central line is in and the multiport set is attached to the patient and continued into the CVICU. This method is derived from extensive research by Dr. Chrysostomou et al to decrease incidences of ventricular and supraventricular tachyarrhythmias post CV surgery, without significant adverse effects from the dexmedetomidine.  
  
Consider appropriate methods of sedation and pain control.  
Assess for signs of valvular dysfunction and/or atrial dysrhythmias.  
  
May have atrial and ventricular pacing wires when appropriate  
  
Communicate plan for drips coming off pump, if needed.  
  
Discuss blood products, if needed.  
  
**Possible Complications:**  
Air emboli (VAE)  
Supraventricular dysrhythmias  
Heart block (likely secondary to atriotomy)  
Ventricular dysfunction.  
Pulmonary hypertension in some defects
