### Wet Tap

Even in experienced hands, the epidural needle may be advanced too far and puncture a hole in the dura. When this happens, there is a significant leak of CSF exiting the hub of your epidural needle. As you know, the epidural needle is much larger than a spinal needle, so there is much more greater volume of CSF leakage.  
  
Many experienced anesthesia providers say that if you have never had a “wet tap,” then you have NOT performed enough epidurals!  
  
We tend to cringe when we witness a “wet tap” because of the correlation with postdural puncture headaches (PDPH).  
  
**Note:** Literatures varies-below is one.  
  
In pregnant women, epidural catheter placement for labor analgesia or Cesarean delivery is associated with a 0.6%–1.6% frequency of dural puncture.  
  
A wet tap with a 17 gauge epidural needle results in a 50% (some literature states higher) incidence of postdural puncture headache. So it is wise to stick with a 16g epidural needle.  
In addition, prophylactic epidural blood patches performed less than 24 hours after dural puncture have a 71% failure rate.  
After 24 hours there is a failure rate of 4%.  
  
**After a Wet Tap**  
Remain calm and reassure patient and immediately take a course of action.  
If you use loss of resistance with air, the patient may immediately complain of headache because of a pneumocephalus. Explain to the patient this is normal and they are ok.  
  
**2 Common Options**  
1\. **Thread the catheter** intrathecally and run a continuous spinal infusion.  
2\. **Remove the Tuohy** needle and attempt epidural placement at another level.  
Before you remove the epidural needle, make a mental note of the depth of the needle before you remove it, this will help you avoid another wet tap).  
  
**Run a continuous spinal infusion and Dose**  
If you opt to thread the epidural catheter into the intrathecal space, 2‐5 cm (maximum) should suffice. Confirm backflow of CSF, and dose the intrathecal catheter for a laboring patient per your staff’s preference.  
A common dose is 1/10th the rate of your usual epidural mixture.  
**Example:** You might start with 1 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with fentanyl 15 mcg (as we do with CSEs for laboring patients), followed by a continuous infusion of 1 mL of 0.1% bupivacaine with 2 mcg/mL of fentanyl per hour. Adjust your dose as necessary, but be sure to opt for continuous infusion on the pump settings and to disable the patient‐controlled dosing option.  
  
Tell the patient that her catheter is in the CSF space and that she might be at risk of a headache, explaining that a wet tap with subsequent headache is a not an unusual complication of with epidural placement.  
  
**Label the catheter as “intrathecal”**  
It is imperative that the catheter and epidural pump be labeled “intrathecal” and inform the nurse and all staff involved that it is an “intrathecal catheter.” You can also write it on the board next to the patient’s name.  
If someone changes the rate or delivers an epidural bolus through a spinal catheter there could be disastrous results.  
Many providers leave the catheter in for 24 hours post wet tap in order to decrease the chance of PDPH  
  
**If you Remove the Touhy when you see a wet tap  
**If you opt to remove the Touhy and attempt epidural placement at another level, advise the patient that she might develop a headache.  
  
Also, be aware that dosing the epidural in the setting of a prior frank wet tap might require dosing adjustments. A lower dose than you typically administer is advised.  
  
Dose the epidural prudently and perform frequent assessments and blood pressure measurements; reassess the patient frequently during the course of her labor.  
  
**LABEL LABEL LABEL!** Be sure to label your pump, tubing and even consider a sign over patient’s bed. Stay with patient to confirm level and adjust rate as needed.  
  
Also document that the patient had a wet tap on both the labor record and in a common logbook within your dept. Many of these log books may be kept in your stock room.  
Inform the patient’s nurse and other anesthesia providers who are involved in the patient’s care.  
  
Follow up on these patients for 3‐5 days postpartum, assessing for any signs of postdural puncture headache (PDPH).  
  
On occasion it takes multiple attempts to locate the epidural space, placing the patient at risk for a dural tear even in the absence of a frank wet tap. Please inform the patient and team members who assume care once your shift is over that the patient may be at risk for a headache. Communication is essential in this scenario, as otherwise the patient may go untreated for a PDPH.
