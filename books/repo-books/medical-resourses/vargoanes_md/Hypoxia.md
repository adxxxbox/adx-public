## Hypoxia

**Hypoxia with a non-intubated patient  
**First Confirm - Check for cyanosis, color of gums and pulse ox placement  
Check RR, VT, ETCO2  
Did you just administer propofol or a narcotic?  
_Use chin lift / jaw thrust if using a mask and insert an oral or nasal airway if needed.  
Hand Ventilate with 100% oxygen and high flowrate._  
Are you able to mask ventilate?  
Breath sounds? Wheezing-COPD? (Consider Albuterol puffs)  
Do you have an ETCO2 reading?  
Do you need to intubate?  
Call for anesthesia STAT at anytime, especially if you cannot ventilate or resolve the hypoxia.  
Do you need a crash cart or airway cart?  
**  
Note:** Never stop ventilating or abandon the airway to prepare meds and intubation equipment. The anesthesia help arriving can do that.

**  
Hypoxia with an LMA  
**First Confirm - _Check for cyanosis, color of gums and pulse ox sensor  
Increase Oxygen to 100% with high flows_  
Find and treat the cause  
Try to manually ventilate and assess compliance  
Immediately check LMA placement and ventilator circuit connections.  
Check for breathing circuit disconnection or obstruction.  
Reposition or remove the LMA when in doubt.  
Insert an oral airway and attempt to ventilate after LMA removal.  
Suction if necessary  
Treat laryngospasm if present  
After Hypoxia is resolved, either reinsert the LMA or Intubate.

**Hypoxia with an Intubated patient**  
Increase Oxygen to 100% with high flows.  
Immediately check ETT placement and ventilator circuit connections.  
Take patient off the ventilator and manually ventilate with large tidal volumes.  
Call for Anesthesia Help Stat if you cannot resolve the hypoxia immediately.  
Check compliance and breath sounds.  
Do you have an ETCO2 reading?  
Is the patient light and clamping down?  
Drug induced-Methylene Blue?  
How are the vital sounds?

  
If your patient is hypoxic WITHOUT an ETCO2 reading while manually ventilating, immediately check a pulse and cycle your BP cuff.  
Do not wait for a BP reading to start CPR with the absence of ETCO2 and a pulse.

If unable to ventilate manually, consider urgently passing a suction catheter or emergency bronchoscopy.  
Stat ABG

**Other Notes:**  
**CIRCULATION Issue Suspected**  
Check pulse  
Check blood pressure  
Check ECG  
Blood loss / dehydration / fluid loss? Consider IV fluid replacement

**Drug Induced or Anaphylaxis**  
Did you recently administer any drugs?Opioids

Volatile agent  
Sedatives  
Muscle relaxant  
High spinal?  

Did you administer any IV Dyes (Methylene Blue)?

**EQUIPMENT**  
Check for breathing circuit disconnection  
Quick pressure check your circuit for leaks  
Check for breathing circuit obstruction

**If problem not resolving:**  
Eliminate circuit - use self inflating bag  
_If self inflating bag not available consider:_  
Mouth to mouth / tracheal tube ventilation

**Possible Causes of Hypoxia (Respiratory)  
**Aspiration-see Aspiration  
Bronchospasm-see Bronchospasm  
Atelectasis  
Hypoventilation  
Obesity  
Pneumothorax  
Pulmonary Edema  
Negative Pressure Pulmonary Edema  
Right mainstem intubation  
Inappropriate ventilator settings

**If the airway is patent (air issues are ruled out), consider other etiology  
**Venous Airway Embolus-See VAE  
Amniotic Fluid Embolism –See AFE  
Pulmonary Embolus  
Other Embolus  
  
**Cardiac  
**CHF  
CAD or Ischemia  
Congenital Defect  
Severe Sepsis (associated with hypotension - see Hypotension-Severe)  
  
**Consider Bedside Tests  
**Bronchoscopy  
CXR or use a C-arm  
TEE  
12 Lead EKG
