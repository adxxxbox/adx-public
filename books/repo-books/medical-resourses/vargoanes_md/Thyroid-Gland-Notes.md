### Thyroid Gland Notes and Facts

A healthy thyroid gland is shaped like a butterfly, with right and left lobes connected by a bridge called the thyroid isthmus. Depending on the reason for a thyroidectomy, all or part of the thyroid gland can be removed.

The thyroid gland is regulated by a negative feedback system. The hypothalamus secretes Thyrotropic Releasing Hormone (TRH), which stimulates the anterior pituitary to release thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) into the circulation.

TSH then activates the thyroid gland to produce and release T3 and T4. Iodine is also required to produce thyroid hormone.  
T4 is produced entirely by the thyroid gland while 80% of T3 is produced in the peripheral tissues and the liver through the conversion of T4 to T3.  
The levels T3 and T4 in the circulation provide negative feedback to the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary to inhibit further TRH and TSH release.

Iodine is a critical component of thyroid hormones and composes 65% of T4 weight and 58% of T3 weight.

T3 is the active hormone; it’s 3x more potent and has a shorter 1/2 life than T4.  
T4 is the prohormone, broken down in the tissues to form T3 as needed; it’s bound and stored in thyroid tissue.

A high serum iodine concentration will also suppress the release of thyroid hormones.

**Thyroid Storm (**Thyrotoxic crisis) is an acute, life-threatening, hypermetabolic state induced by excessive release of thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) which increases cellular function systemically.

Only 1-2% of persons with hyperthyroidism will develop thyroid storm.

The mortality rate can be as high as 50-90% if left untreated.  
Thyroid storm occurs most often from Grave’s disease.

T3 and T4 are bound to plasma protein in the circulation.  
The unbound or free thyroid hormones actually regulate the negative feedback system; therefore, evaluating the free hormone levels is important as well as evaluating the total hormone levels.

**Normal Thyroid Function Test:**   
Total thyroxine (T4): 4.5-12.0 µg/dl  
Free T4: 0.7-1.9 ng/dl  
Total triiodothyronine (T3): 80-180ng/dl  
Free T3: 230-619 pg/dl  
TSH 0.5-6 µU/ml
