### Returning to Bypass

In the event of severe hypotension, bleeding, low cardiac output, or other problems, it may be necessary to re-initiate cardiopulmonary bypass.  
  
If anticoagulation with anticoagulation has already been reversed using Protamine, heparin must be re-dosed at 300 units/kg and an ACT determined.  
Ideally, failure to separate from bypass was discovered before removal of the aortic cannula. The cardiac anesthesiologist and the surgical team must be aware of this situation. Resumption of bypass is more readily accomplished if the aortic cannula remains in place.  
  
**At this time, use of the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) may be indicated.** The balloon pump requires an ECG signal and an arterial pressure signal.  
  
It may be possible to obtain the ECG signal from the monitor already present. Alternatively, the perfusionist may arrange a source independent of the monitors in use.  
  
Once the IABP is is functioning and has produced an improvement, further attempts to separate from bypass are undertaken.
