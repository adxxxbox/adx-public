Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

## Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST)

Local Anesthetic Toxicity may occur 1 to 5 minutes after an excessive dose, with rapid absorption, or because of an accidental intravenous injection/  
But onset may range from 30 seconds to as long as 60 minutes.

So always be aware for any of the changes below after a regional block.

**Local Anesthetic Toxicity mostly involves the:**  
Central nervous system (CNS) and/or  
Cardiovascular system.

**Possible Initial Neuro Symptom:  
**Tongue numbness  
Circumoral numbness  
Metallic taste  
Lightheadedness  
Dizziness  
Visual and auditory disturbances (difficulty focusing and tinnitus)  
Disorientation  
Drowsiness

**Advanced Neuro Symptoms (INTERVENTION Necessary)  
**Muscle twitching heralds the onset on tonic-clonic seizures  
Sudden alteration in mental status  
Severe Agitation  
Decreased LOC with or without tonic-clonic convulsions

**Possible Cardiac Symptoms**  
Cardiovascular collapse  
Sinus Bradycardia  
Conduction Blocks  
Asystole  
V-Tachy

**Treatment of Local Anesthetic Toxicity  
**Stop injecting the local anesthetic

**  
Airway Management**  
Ventilate with 100% O2, if necessary-intubate to secure the airway.  
Hyperventilation may help by increasing plasma pH with metabolic acidosis.  
  
**Seizure suppression**: benzodiazepines- versed is preferred.

Benzodiazepines lower the probability of seizures but can mask early signs of toxicity.  
AVOID propofol in patients having signs of cardiovascular instability.

**Management of Cardiac Arrhythmias (if present)**  
\- Give 10% calcium gluconate or 10% calcium chloride to raise the cardiac threshold and prevent dysrhythmias  
\- Utilize ACLS

**AVOID the following drugs**  
Vasopressin  
Calcium channel blockers  
Beta-blockers  
Local anesthetics  
Reduce individual epinephrine doses

**Doses of 20% Intralipids  
**Initial Bolus 1.5ml/kg (lean body mass) over 1 minute  
(Repeat bolus once or twice for persistent cardiovascular collapse  

Then  
  
Infusion rate of 0.25mL/kg/min over 20 minutes

70kg patient = 350mLs over 20 minutes

80kg patient =400mLs over 20 minutes

90kg patient = 450mLs over 20 minutes

100kg patient = 500mLs over 20 minutes

Increase infusion rate up to 0.50 mL/kg/min for refractory hypotension

**  
Continue infusion** for at least 10 minutes after attaining circulatory stability  
Recommended upper limit: Approximately 10 mL/kg lipid emulsion over the first 30 minutes

**Defibrillator Instructions  
**Place electrodes appropriately on chest  
Turn Defibrillator ON  
Dial in Defib mode  
Set on: Biphasic 200J for 70kg patient  
120-150J for < 70kg  
To deliver a shock: press CHARGE then press shock

**More Notes**  
Patients who received versed will have higher seizure threshold, and may not manifest seizure activity before complete CNS depression results.

**Cardiovascular system - How it is affected**  
Local anesthetics may block the fast sodium channels in the fast-conducting tissue of Purkinje fibers and ventricles resulting in a decrease rate of depolarization.  
The effective refractory period and action potential duration are also reduced by local anesthetics. High concentrations can decrease conduction times leading to prolonged PR intervals and widened QRS complexes, and even sinus brady/arrest.

Ventricular arrhythmias and fibrillation are more common with Bupivacaine than lidocaine.  
  
Local anesthetics have a dose-dependent negative inotropic effect.  
  
Patients with acidosis and/or hypoxia are at a greater risk for the cardiac depressant effects of local anesthetics.  
  
Patients under general anesthesia may typically present with cardiotoxicity as the first sign of local anesthetic toxicity.
