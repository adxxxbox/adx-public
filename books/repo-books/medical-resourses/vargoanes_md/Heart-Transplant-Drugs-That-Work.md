### Heart Transplant- Drugs That Work

For patients who have had a heart transplant.

**Anesthetic Goal:**  
Avoid significant vasodilation-------Avoid acute decreases in preload.

A transplanted heart can respond to direct-acting drugs (e.g., sympathomimetics). Epinephrine and norepinephrine have an augmented inotropic effect in heart transplant recipients.

Find out how long ago the patient has had their transplant. There are studies in transplant literature about cardiac nerve re-enervation to the transplanted heart, especially after 15 years.  
Unpredictable re-enervation may occur after heart transplantation.

**Anesthetic Goal:**  
Avoid significant vasodilation  
Avoid acute decreases in preload  
Avoid Bradycardia  
Avoid Infection

**The denervated heart can respond ONLY by increasing stroke volume, not heart rate. Recipients are thus “preload dependent” and must have adequate central volume to meet the demands of stress and of anesthetic techniques that redistribute vascular volume to the periphery.**

**Transplanted heart patients have:**  
An increased SVR  
Increased HR  
Are dependent upon venous return for CO because the HR is usually at a fixed rate.

**Inotropes and Drugs that WILL work on a denervated heart**  
Isuprel-Increases contractility and HR  
Epinephrine: (0.03-0.3 mcg/kg/min) Also increases HR.  
Milrinone (0.375-0.75mcg/kg/min)  
Dopamine: (2-10mcg/kg/min)-Weakest of the 4 Inotropes  
Ephedrine: Works, but has a blunted affect.  
Norepinephrine: Works like Epinephrine.  
Propranolol: Decreases HR and contractility.  
Neostigmine: Can cause severe bradycardia (rare).  
Dobutamine (2.5-20mcg/kg/min) can also increase HR.  
**For Bradycardia:**  
Treat first with Isuprel diluted in a syringe. If Isuprel does not work, the BP will have already dropped and then push 10-20mcg of Epinephrine. Ephedrine also works.

**For Hypotension not related to Bradycardia:**  
Vasopressin 1-2 units; it does NOT increase PVR.  
Give Neosynephrine, then give Epinephrine if needed.  
500-1,000mg CaCl also works.  
  
**Pancuronium** has no hemodynamic effects on the denervated heart, although it has normal systemic effects  
  
**Dopamine** acts predominantly by the release of norepinephrine and, consequently, is a less effective inotrope in the denervated heart, having primarily dopaminergic and α effects.  
  
**Isoproterenol and Dobutamine** have similar effects in both denervated and normal hearts. Therefore, they are both effective inotropes in the denervated heart. They both increase myocardial contractility more than dopamine.  
  
Vagolytic drugs, such as **Atropine,** are ineffective in increasing the HR. But positive chronotropic drugs, e.g., ephedrine and Isuprel will increase the HR on a denervated heart.  
  
**Inhalation Agent:** Avoid Nitrous Oxide because it can increase PVR. Our common inhaled agents have well known myocardial depressant properties, but they are still well tolerated, unless there is significant heart failure.
