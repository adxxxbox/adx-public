**Magnesium**  
  
Administer when the aortic clamp is removed.  
  
2 grams MgSO4 IV is given immediately after cross-clamping the aorta. It may be administered by the perfusionist.  
  
Mg levels are commonly decreased post CPB.  
  
In cardiac surgery, the development of arrhythmias and low output syndrome are potential complications. Mg has been used post aortic cross-clamping, included in cardioplegic solutions and in the postoperative period as an electrolyte replacement.  
  
Magnesium may help stabilize the myocardial membrane by inhibiting a myosin phosphorylase, which protects adenosine triphosphate (ATP) reserves for post-ischemic activity. The protective effects of magnesium and potassium have been shown to be additive.  
  
Magnesium acts as co-factor in more than 300 enzymatic reactions, including nucleic acid synthesis and energy metabolism.  
  
Its beneficial action on ischemic myocardial cells (post myocardial infarction or post reperfusion) is related to cellular protection shifting mitochondrial calcium to sarcoplasmic reticulum and competing to troponin C-Ca binding.
