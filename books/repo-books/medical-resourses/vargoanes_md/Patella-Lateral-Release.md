Lateral Release – Patella     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Lateral Release – Patella

Realigning the kneecap. The kneecap moves up and down in a groove on the end of the femur as the knee bends. When the knee moves laterally (patellar tilt), the lateral retinaculum is too tight and pulls the patella out of alignment and causes pain. This is called patella femoral syndrome. The surgeon will cut through this tight retinaculum, and allow the kneecap to sit properly within its groove.

Patella Femoral Syndrome (PFPS) frequently occurs in teenagers, manual laborers, and athletes.
