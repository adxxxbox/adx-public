Distraction Osteogenesis of the Mandible (DO)   

### Distraction Osteogenesis of the Mandible (DO)

  
**Mandibular Distraction**  
_By JoVanna Eisenbarth CRNA Mason General Hospital_

This is a relatively new surgical technique to help with the reconstruction of the jaw. This process allows the patient to grow bone without receiving bone grafting as well as expanding the tissues around the area. The surgery was originally used in orthopedic surgery to lengthen the limbs.

**Introduction**  
Some babies, for example those with Pierre-Robin, Treacher Collins or Goldenhar syndrome; are born with markedly recessed chins leading to profound breathing problems and sleep apnea. When this pronounced micrognathia causes severe upper airway obstruction, a surgeon may choose to use Mandibular Distractors. This can save these kids from needing a tracheostomy or suffering long-term damage from impaired ventilation.

**Short summary of the procedure:**  
With this surgery, small incisions are made under the mandible, the bone is then cut, and the metal distraction devices are placed on the mandible. The skin is closed around the distractors with the end exposed outside of the skin. Post operatively parents crank the distractors at prescribed intervals, in turn causing the bones to separate from each other and new bone formation occurs; in turn lengthening the lower jaw. The distractors are left in place for a period of time to allow the bone to solidify and then infant returns to the OR for removal of the distractors at a later date.

**Pre-op and what to prepare**  
**Anesthetic:** General anesthesia, normally with oral intubation, although nasal intubation is also an option. Suturing in place is an option.**Airway issues:** Due to their profound micrognathia, anticipate a difficult airway. Discuss degree of airway obstruction with family and note their methods of decreasing obstruction—side positioning etc. If severe impairment, consider awake fiberoptic. Remember your shoulder roll to help open the airway.

**Induction:** Cautious and slow induction is often best, maintaining spontaneous ventilation as long as possible. Consider one person to jaw thrust and a second anesthesia provider to man the fiberoptic. Due to severe micrognathia, two person mask ventilation may be warranted to ensure both a mask seal & successfully ventilate the patient.**Muscle Relaxation:** Post-intubation relaxation can be used, although it’s not entirely necessary**Position** : The patient will be supine with head on a donut or other holder to decrease movement. The bed will often be turned 180 degrees, so have a circuit extension ready and watch where drapes are taped, guard your tube and associated ventilation tubing! Be vigilant and aware if surgeon repositions the head, watch to prevent accidental extubation or tube migration. Don’t let the fiberoptic leave the room!  
**Duration:** 2-3hours  
**EBL:** minimal  
**IV Access:** 1 nice flowing IV is normally enough  
**Hydration: 4:2:1 (below is just a common reference)  
**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**A-line:** not necessary**Age Range:** normally less than 6mo. There is a delicate balance between increased safety and bone thickness with age, versus increased risk in waiting.

**Emergence:** Due to the risk of airway swelling, compounding an already tenous airway, these patients may remain intubated post operatively for 12-24 hours. Don’t let the fiberoptic leave the room until after the baby does.

**How we treat a drop in BP:** fluid boluses, Phenylephrine boluses (1-10mg/kg), treat the cause.**  
  
Possible Complications**  
Difficult intubation  
Accidental Extubation  
Post op hypoventilation—mechanical or central  
Airway swelling
