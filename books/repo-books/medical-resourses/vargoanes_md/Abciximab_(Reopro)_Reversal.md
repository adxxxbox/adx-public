### Abciximab (Reopro®) Reversal

_Currently, there is a lack of specific antidotes for the growing number of new (novel) anticoagulants that are slowly replacing warfarin and heparin. For this reason, there is NO universal standard of care for the treatment of the anticoagulated bleeding patient when there is no specific antidote._

**Consult cardiology for ALL patients with coronary stents.**

**Quick Notes  
**Abciximab is mainly used in cath lab for PCIs.  
The aPTT or ACT should be checked prior to arterial sheath removal. The sheath should not be removed unless aPTT < 50 seconds or ACT < 175 seconds.  
“Irreversible” GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor.  
Inhibits platelet aggregation for the life span of the platelets.  
Platelet aggregation gradually returns to normal about 96 to 120 hours after discontinuation of the drug with development of newly produced unbound platelets.  
  
**Other two GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors:**  
Eptifibatide (Integrilin)  
Tirofiban (Aggrastat): reversible.  
  
**A study:**  
After discontinuation of abciximab infusion, platelet function returns gradually to normal. Bleeding time returned to ≤ 12 minutes within 12 hours following the end of infusion in 15 of 20 patients (75%), and within 24 hours in 18 of 20 patients (90%).  
  
Some GPIIb/IIIa receptors may still be occupied by drug up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of drug infusion. In the event of bleeding, the  antithrombotic effects of abciximab cannot be rapidly reversed by discontinuing therapy, but rather are administering platelets.  
  
_Abciximab is an antiplatelet anticoagulant. It is platelet function we are concerned about._**Specific antidote:** None  
**Initial treatment** Discontinue infusion and hold future doses of abciximab.  
Find out when the last dose of abciximab was taken.  
  
**Consider routine lab tests:** CBC, BMP, liver function tests and DIC.  
If platelet count < 20,000/µl, consider transfusion of 1 unit of platelets.  
  
**Mild Bleed  
**Apply mechanical compression.  
Recommend hematology consult.  
**Pharmacological options for mild bleeding.  
Tranexamic acid (TXA):** Loading dose: 1 gram over 10 minutes followed by maintenance dose of 1 gram over next 8 hours (125 mg/hr). Contraindicated with stents or recent MI.  
**Desmopressin (DDAVP):** 0.3 mcg/kg x 1  
(While DDAVP should dilate the coronary vessels in healthy subjects, it may provoke coronary vasospasm in patients with endothelial dysfunction).  
Consider platelet transfusion-if platelet function assay indicate it.  
  
**Severe Bleed  
**Recommend hematology consult.  
Platelet transfusion: may only partly reverse.  
  
**Life-threatening Bleed**  
Hematology/coagulation consult is recommended.  
Additional products may be needed to obtain hemostasis  
PCCs  
  
**Optional laboratory tests that analyze platelet function.  
**VerifyNow IIb/IIIa test (platelet function assay).  
Multiplate (platelet function assay).  
PRP-Aggregation (Platelet function test).  
Plateletworks assay (platelet function assay).  
Whole blood platelet aggregation (platelet function assay).  
  
**If patient also on aspirin:** consider VerifyNow aspirin test.
