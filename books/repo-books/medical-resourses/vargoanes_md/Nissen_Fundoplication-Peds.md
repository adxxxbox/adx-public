**Indications:** Children with severe GERD, failed medical treatment, recurrent aspiration, intermittent apnea, failure to thrive and Barret esophagitis.  
Neurologically impaired children who require a gastronomy tube for feeding may also require a fundoplication.

**Age:** Usually infants, children and adolescents.

**Clinical Spectrum**  
Can be asymptomatic  
Severe esophagitis  
Esophageal stricture  
Esophageal bleeding-ulcers  
Malnutrition

**Aspiration Risk  
**Respiratory compromise (bronchospasms, chronic aspiration with pneumonitis, RAD, and apnea)  
Failure to thrive  
  
Typically, kids who require a fundoplication have other underlying issues, such as cerebral palsy, inborn error of metabolism, trisomy 21 or other neurological impairments.

**360 - degree fundoplication vs partial wrap of Thai-Nissen  
**Gas bloat syndrome, (aerophagis, gastric distention, inability to belch or vomit) can be associated with a 360-degree fundoplication. To avoid gas boat syndrome, a Thai-Nissen partial wrap is frequently used.

**Surgery (not much different than the adult version)**

The gastric fundus or upper part of the stomach is wrapped, partially wrapped or folded around the lower end of the esophagus and stitched in place, reinforcing the closing function of the lower esophageal sphincter. This prevents the stomach from sliding back up into the chest.

Mortality rate < 1%. Vomiting is almost impossible post operatively. Some patients have said that eructation, also known medically as ructus, or more commonly known as burping or belching is difficult to impossible following a Nissen. This is a big complaint for many, although >90% of patients are highly satisfied on their 8 to 10 year follow-up.

**Laparoscopic or Open Procedure**

**Laparoscopic:** The surgeon stands between the patient's legs while the camera operator stands to the patient's right and the second assistant assumes a position on the patient's left.

**Open procedure**, the surgeon makes a horizontal incision from 5 - 10 cm on the left side of the abdomen. For open procedures, a midthoracic epidural or caudal epidural threaded up to the midthoracic level. It can be placed postoperatively, but it is rare.

**Robotic:** The robot will dock between the patient’s legs in low lithotomy position with the assistants to each side.

**Pre-op  
**Treat as a full stomach because these kids are a high risk for aspiration.

These kids are already on H2 blockers and motility drugs. They should be continued.

**Bougie Insertion**  
During the case, you will be asked to place a large bougie down the esophagus. Make sure you lubricate it. The bougie is to distend the esophagus to maintain a patent esophagus for the wrap.  
**Warning:** DO NOT force the bougie. If there is any resistance, inform the surgeon and let him insert it. CRNAs have been named in malpractice suits for the perforation of the anterior esophagus during resistant insertions, even when the surgeon asked them to keep trying.  
**Laparoscopic:** Usually.  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours, longer if performed robotically.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT and RSI, since these are serious GERD patients.

**Muscle Relaxation:** Yes.  
**Position:** Modified lithotomy position, 1 or 2 arms out and reverse Trendelenburg. Make sure you have easy access to the mouth when it comes time to insert of bougie during the procedure  
**OGT:** Yes to initially decompress the stomach. Then pull it out.  
**IV Access:** 1-2 20g. A second IV is desired if positioning will make it difficult to obtain at a later time.

**Hydration: 4:2:1 (below is just a common reference)  
**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**  
1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**A-line:** Not needed  
**EGD:** Yes, post procedure to evaluation gastric inlet and esophageal trauma.

**EBL:** Minimal

**Fluid Status:** Patient will remain NPO for potentially several days, may start clear liquids day two. Adequate volume resuscitation will aid in decreasing PONV.  
**Antiemetics:** Yes, you need to maximize these to prevent PONV or retching.  
**__Retching and vomiting can damage the healing wrap postoperatively. The patient may need to return to surgery. That is why it is so important to pretreat to prevent nausea.__**  
I know of one surgeon who demands a TIVA for his Nissen procedures. He feels it was the inhalation agent that caused his patient to become nauseated and needed to return to surgery.  
  
**Emergence**

Children with respiratory compromise or neuromuscular disease, waiting to extubate them in the recovery room is a popular option. High narcotic technique may be preferable to allow smooth wake-up in an awake patient decreasing risk of aspiration from deep technique.

**Possible Complications**

Hemorrhage.  
Perforated esophagus.  
Difficulty swallowing because the stomach is wrapped too high on the esophagus or is wrapped too tightly.  
The esophagus sliding out of the wrapped portion of the stomach, so that the LES valve is no longer supported.  
Heartburn that returns.  
Bloating and discomfort from gas buildup because the person is not able to burp.  
Excess gas.  
Risks of anesthesia.  
Infection.

The fundoplication procedure cannot be reversed, and in some cases it may not be possible to relieve the symptoms of these complications, even with a second surgery.

**More Notes**  
With Peds, GERD could be from an immature LES mechanisms that generally resolve by 15 months.

Patients who have survived diaphragmatic hernias, TE Fistula and esophageal atresia repairs appear to be prone to GERD (Barry and Auldist, 1974).

**Seizure Disorders  
**If your patient has a seizure disorder and are on anticonvulsants, oral anticonvulsants generally can’t be administered for 2-3 days post op. Alternative IV meds are usually given.  
  
**Ventricular -Peritoneal shunts and Fundoplications**

Some of these kids may have a VP shunt and are neurologically compromised. The Nissen fundoplication does not increase the infection rate of the VP Shunt.
