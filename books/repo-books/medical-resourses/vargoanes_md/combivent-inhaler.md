# Combivent Inhaler

**Combivent Inhaler (Atrovent and Proventil)**

Combivent is a metered-dose inhaler containing a combination of albuterol and ipratropium (Atrovent). Proventil is a Beta 2 Adrenergic Bronchodilator. Atrovent (Ipratropium bromide) is an anticholinergic bronchodilator. You will rarely see this inhaler unless the patient is already using it and brings it to Holding with them.

Atrovent (Ipratropium) is the main anticholinergic aerosol drug used for bronchodilation. Atrovent is not as potent or quick acting as the Beta 2 agonist Albuterol.

**MOA**  
Due to the antagonism of ACh, the M2 and M3 receptors of the smooth airway muscles are inhibited. This indirectly causes bronchodilation, depending on the preexisting bronchomotor tone.

**Contraindications**  
If are allergic to albuterol (Proventil, Ventolin), ipratropium (Atrovent), or atropine (Atreza, Sal-Tropine). If allergic to soybeans, peanuts, or other food products that contain soya lecithin.  
Combined treatment with ipratropium and b2 adrenergic agonists results in slightly greater and more prolonged bronchodilation than with either agent alone in baseline asthma. In acute bronchoconstriction, the combination of a b2 adrenergic agonist and Ipratropium is more effective than either agent alone and more effective than simply giving more b2 adrenergic agonist.

**Caution**  
There is potential for an additive interaction with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Therefore, avoid co-administration of COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol with other anticholinergic-containing drugs.

**Precautions**  
Effects Seen with Anticholinergic Drugs: COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol contains ipratropium bromide and, therefore, should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hyperplasia, or bladder-neck obstruction.
