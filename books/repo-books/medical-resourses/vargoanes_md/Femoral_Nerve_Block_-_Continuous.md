Femoral Nerve Block - Continuous    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Femoral Nerve Block - Continuous

A continuous femoral nerve block (cFNB)—also termed “perineural local anesthetic infusion” is sometimes used to provide analgesia after major knee surgery.  
  
Recently published data suggest that perineural infusion involving the femoral nerve increases the risk of falling.  
  
**Disadvantage of cFNB:** Muscle weakness  
The femoral nerve innervates the quadriceps femoris muscle required for ambulation, in itself a critical component of postoperative rehabilitation of the knee.**  
  
AKA and TKAs at academic centers:**  
The FNB is more commonly performed at academic centers for below and above-knee amputations.  
Postoperative muscle weakness is not an issue in these situations.  
**Catheter insertion:**The goal of the continuous femoral nerve block is the placement of the catheter within the vicinity of the femoral nerve just deep to the fascia iliaca.  
  
**The procedure consists of five steps:**  
Needle placement  
Injection through the needle to confirm needle placement in the proper tissue plane  
Catheter insertion  
Injection through the catheter to verify a therapeutic position.  
Securing the catheter away from the surgical site  
  
**Common infusion:  
**Ropivacaine 0.2% at an infusion rate of 5 mL/h with a 5 mL/hour patient-controlled bolus.**  
  
Tips:  
**The longer the catheter is positioned within the iliacus muscle, it may prevent dislodgement because the muscle tends to stabilize the catheter more than adipose tissue.This can be enhanced by inserting the catheter more laterally.
