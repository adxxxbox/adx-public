Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Grading Scale     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

#### Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Grading Scale

The Hunt and Hess scale is what we use today for grading SAH aneurysms. It is based on the patient’s clinical condition and is a great predictor for a patient’s prognosis/outcome, with a higher grade correlating to lower survival rate.

**Grades**  
**Grade 1:** Moderate to severe headache, nuchal rigidity, no neurologic deficit other than a cranial nerve palsy.

**Grade 2:** Drowsiness/confusion, a mild focal neurologic deficit.

**Grade 3:** Stupor, moderate to severe hemiparesis.

**Grade 4:** Coma, decerebrate posturing.
