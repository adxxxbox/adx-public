### Midazolam (Versed) Pharmacokinetics

A clear, colorless solution.  
**Vials:** 1, 2 or 5 mg/mL (mand 5 mg/mL are the most popular)  
**Chemical formula:** C18H13CIFN3  
Midazolam is a water-soluble benzodiazepine with an imidazole ring in its structure that accounts for stability in aqueous solutions and rapid metabolism.  
  
**The pK of midazolam:** 6.15, which permits the preparation of water-soluble salts.**  
  
pH-dependent ring phenomena:  
**\- The chemical structure of midazolam is characterized by having a pH-dependent ring phenomenon to become lipid-soluble at a physiologic pH.  
**\- pH < 4:** Ring remains open = water-soluble (packaged this way)  
**\- pH > 4:** Ring closes and becomes lipid soluble  
\- The parenteral solution of midazolam used clinically is buffered to an acidic pH of 3.5.  
\- The high lipid solubility permits it to cross the blood-brain barrier resulting in immediate clinical effects rapidly.  
\- After it is injected into a more basic solution, it becomes lipid soluble.  
**  
Propylene glycol:  
**\- An additive to midazolam and other benzodiazepines for solubilizing the preparation.  
\- Propylene glycol may cause vein irritation with injected IV or interfere with absorption after an IM injection.  
\- However, midazolam causes minimal to no discomfort during or after IV or IM injection.  
  
**Systemic absorption per route:**  
**Oral Absorption:**  
\- It is rapidly absorbed after oral administration.  
\- Oral midazolam is rapidly metabolism by hepatic and small intestine cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4) enzymes to active and inactive metabolites.  
\- Due to first-pass metabolism, only 40-50% of the administered oral dose reaches the circulation.  
\- The absolute bioavailability of midazolam syrup in pediatric patients is about 36%.  
  
**Intramuscular Absorption:**  
\- The mean peak concentration (Cmax) and time to peak (Tmax) following the IM dose was 90 ng/mL (20% CV) and 0.5 hours (50% CV).  
\- The absolute bioavailability, if given intramuscularly (IM), is greater than 90%.  
**  
Rectal administration:**  
After rectal administration, midazolam is absorbed rapidly. Maximum plasma concentration is reached within 30 minutes. The absolute bioavailability is approximately 50%.  
**  
Intranasal Administration:**  
\- Midazolam is absorbed rapidly after intranasal administration. Mean peak plasma concentrations are reached within 10.2 to 12.6 minutes.  
\- The bioavailability is between 55 and 57%.  
  
**Equivalent dose of 0.15 - 0.3 mf of Midazolam:  
**Diazepam: 0.3 - 0.5 mg  
Lorazepam: 0.05 mg  
**Sedation onset:  
\- Volume of distribution (L/kg):** 1.0 - 1.5**\- Protein binding (%):** 96 - 98 mainly albumin.  
\- The metabolite 1-hydroxymidazolam is 89% protein bound.  
**\- Clearance (mL/kg/min):** 6 - 8  
**\- Elimination half-time (hour):** 1 - 4  
  
**Possible causes of an increased volume of distribution:  
**Female gender  
Old age  
Obesity  
  
**Midazolam IV and IM metabolism:**  
\- The short duration of action of a single dose of midazolam is due to its lipid solubility, leading to rapid redistribution from the brain to inactive tissue sites as well as rapid hepatic clearance.  
\- Midazolam, diazepam, and flumazenil are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and by glucuronide conjugation.  
  
**Midazolam metabolism:  
**\- Midazolam is primarily metabolized in the liver and gut (when PO) by a cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP3A4) to its pharmacologic active metabolites.  
\- The primary active metabolite is alpha-hydroxymidazolam (also known as 1-hydroxy-midazolam).  
\- Another metabolite is 4-hydroxymidazolam (which makes up 5% or less of the biotransformation products).  
\- 1-hydroxy-midazolam likely contributes to the pharmacological effects of midazolam.  
\- Midazolam also undergoes N-glucuronidation via UGT1A4 after hepatic oxidation by cytochrome enzymes.  
  
**Midazolam metabolites:  
**1-hydroxymidazolam (also called alpha-hydroxymidazolam) - the main one  
1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide  
4-hydroxymidazolam  
**  
1-hydroxymidazolam:**  
\- The principal metabolite  
\- 1-hydroxymidazolam has half midazolam’s activity and substantial pharmacologic activity when present in high concentrations.  
  
**1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide:  
**\- 1-hydroxymidazolam is rapidly conjugated to 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide and is cleared by the kidneys.  
\- In these patients, the 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide metabolite may also have synergistic sedative effects with the parent compound.  
\- Patients with renal insufficiency may have synergistic sedative effects from 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide.  
  
**4-hydroxymidazolam:**  
\- This active metabolite is not present in detectable concentrations in the plasma following IV administration of midazolam.  
  
**Hepatic clearance and fentanyl:**  
\- Hepatic clearance of midazolam is temporarily inhibited by fentanyl when administered during general anesthesia.  
\- Overall, the hepatic clearance rate of midazolam is five times greater than that of lorazepam and 10 times greater than that of diazepam.  
**  
Metabolism of midazolam is slowed in the presence of the following drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes:**  
Cimetidine  
Erythromycin  
Calcium channel blockers  
Antifungal drugs  
  
Altering the metabolism of midazolam may result in unexpected CNS depression.  
  
**Renal Clearance:  
**Renal failure does not alter elimination half-time, Vd, and renal clearance of midazolam.  
**Overall clearance of midazolam is reduced in association with:**  
\- Old age  
\- Congestive heart failure  
\- Conditions that diminish cardiac output  
\- Liver disease (cirrhosis) and conditions that diminish cardiac output and hepatic blood flow.  
\- Medications that inhibit the P450-3A4 enzyme.  
**Urinary excretion:  
**\- The principal urinary excretion product is 1-hydroxy-midazolam in the form of a glucuronide conjugate.  
\- Smaller amounts of the glucuronide conjugates of 4-hydroxy- and dihydroxy-midazolam are also detected.  
\- The amount of midazolam excreted unchanged in the urine after a single IV dose is less than 0.5% (n=5).  
\- Following a single IV infusion in 5 healthy volunteers, 45% to 57% of the dose was excreted in the urine as 1-hydroxymethyl midazolam conjugate.  
**  
Continuous infusion:**  
\- Midazolam can accumulate in peripheral tissues with long- and short-term continuous infusions.  
\- The effects of accumulation can be reduced by maintaining the lowest midazolam infusion rate that produces satisfactory sedation.  
\- Infrequent hypotensive episodes have occurred during continuous infusion.  
\- However, the occurrence of a hypotensive appears to be unrelated to increased loading doses.  
  
**Pediatric continuous infusion:**  
\- With continuous infusion, the pharmacokinetic properties in pediatric patients are similar to adults.  
\- The terminal elimination half-life of midazolam is prolonged, while the clearance is  
reduced with seriously ill neonates as compared to healthy adults or other groups of pediatric patients.  
  
**Midazolam and obesity:  
**\- A study showed that the mean half-life was greater in the obese group (5.9 hours vs. 2.3 hours) due to an increase in volume distribution when compared to a nonobese patient.  
\- The clearance was not significantly different between groups.  
  
**Geriatrics:  
**\- A study showed that the plasma half-life was approximately doubled in the elderly.  
\- It may be further influenced by obesity, renal, cardiac, or hepatic conditions, and certain drugs  
that inhibit P450-3A4 enzyme.\- The mean volume distribution based on total body weight increased consistently between 15% to 100% in the elderly.  
\- The mean clearance decreased by approximately 25% in the elderly in two studies and was similar to that of the younger patients.  
  
**Hepatic insufficiency:**  
\- A study showed the mean half-life of midazolam increased 2.5-fold in alcoholic patients.  
\- Clearance was reduced by 50%.  
\- Volume distribution was increased by 20%.  
  
**Renal failure:**  
\- Patients with renal impairment may have longer elimination half-lives for midazolam and its metabolites, resulting in slower recovery.
