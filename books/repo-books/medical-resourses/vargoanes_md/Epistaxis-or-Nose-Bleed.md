### Epistaxis or Nose Bleed

Epistaxis is defined as acute hemorrhage from the nostril, nasal cavity, or nasopharynx. 

90% of them are treated by the ER doc.  
**Age distribution:** Epistaxis occurs mostly in children 2-10 years old and adults 50-80 years old.  90% of bleeds are anterior and can be controlled by pinching the anterior aspect of the nose.

**Treatments to be considered include:**  
Topical vasoconstriction (Afrin spray).  
Silver Nitrate sticks.  
Chemical cautery.  
Electrocautery  
Nasal packing (nasal tampon or gauze impregnated with petroleum jelly).  
Posterior gauze packing.  
Use of a balloon system (including a modified Foley catheter), Arterial ligation or embolization.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT using an oral Rae and an LTA kit.  
**Muscle Relaxant:** Theoretically, they don’t need to be relaxed, but we sometimes we do to prevent coughing.  
**Inhalation Agent:** Sevo or Forane are popular for these procedures.

**Duration:** 15-30 minutes.  
**EBL:** 10-50 mLs  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
**Positioning:** Supine, HOB up 10-20 degrees or reverse Trendelenburg. The patient’s arm will be tucked on the side of the bed where the surgeon will sit. Sometimes the bed is rotated 90 degrees. 

**Antiemetics:** yes; give Decadron and Zofran.

**NGT:** For the surgeon to pass ORALLY after the throat pack is out.

**Decrease FiO2:** Yes, if cauterization is used.

**Avoid hypertension:** To minimize bleeding, but keep the BP within 20% of the base. Consider a beta blocker with emergence. You can titrate your inhalation agent to the desired BP.  
**Emergence:** Smooth and try to avoid coughing. Give Lidocaine .25mg/kg; it works!

**Robinul:** Yes, to prevent secretions from draining and agitating the vocal cords. Gently suction the oral pharynx with a catheter (not a Yankauer). At the end of the operation, it is customary to have a pack or sponge dressing in each nostril to soak up any blood. This is kept in for a few hours. The patient is now an obligate mouth breather.  
**Extubation:** Deep or Awake? Many CRNAs will extubate deep with the HOB elevated. Some patients may require an awake extubation, so try to make it smooth. 

Some CRNAs insert an LMA immediately after a deep extubation and transport the patient to the recovery room. The LMA is removed when the patient awakes. This drastically decreases turnover time.
