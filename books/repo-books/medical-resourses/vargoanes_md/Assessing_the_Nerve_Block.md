### Assessing the Nerve Block with Neuraxial Anesthesia

_Always remember: Loss of cold sensation is observed at a higher dermatomal level than pinprick.  
  
_**Alcohol Swab and Skin Temperature  
**An alcohol wipe is useful to assess the level of sympathectomy by measuring the patients’ ability to perceive skin temperature sensation. Application of cold is popular, but usually defines a level of block above the dermatome from level of ‘surgical’ anesthesia.  
Temperature perception is lost before pinprick perception and generally lost at a higher level-as mentioned above.  
  
**Blunt Needle (Gentle Pin Prick) and Sensory Level**  
A blunt needle is useful in the assessment of the sensory level. It should be sharp enough to cause a “pin prick” sensation but not so sharp as to break the patients skin. Some snap a tongue depressor in half and use the jagged edges.  
The pin prick differentiates SHARP and DULL sensation and indicates a better assessment of the level of SURGICAL anesthesia then cold temp-alcohol swab.  
  
**Afferent** \= Sensory  
**Efferent** \= Motor  
  
**Afferent assessment** \- assessed by alcohol swab or blunt needle Mechanical stimuli such as touch, skin pinch or pressure can also be used.    
  
**Loss of sensation in order:**  
Sensation to cold occurs first- C fibers  
Pinprick- A-d fibers  
Touch- A-b fibers  
  
**Anatomical Innervation of Nerves  
**Just because the area of skin on the belly a surgeon pinches for a C-section is numb, does not mean that everything underneath is anesthetized. This is due to the way our body develops and the spinal segmental level of innervation for dermatomes.  
Remember that nerves innervate the skin, myotomes (muscle) and organs, and do not necessarily coincide.  
  
**Remember:  
**During a low transverse C-section, skin incision is around T12-L1  
The structures underneath have spinal segmental innervations much higher.  
The uterus is innervated by T10  
The peritoneum has innervations as high as T4.  
  
This is why a patient should ideally be numb up as far as her nipple line (T4-5) if she is to not feel pain during a C-section.  
  
**Why a patient may feel uncomfortable pressure during a C-section** The peritoneal innervation may not be completely blocked in all patients.  
You should always warn your C-section patients that they may also feel uncomfortable pressure when the surgeon pushes down on their abdomen while facilitating the removal of their baby from the open uterus.  
  
**Efferent (Motor) Function and Bromage Scale** As a block extends cephalad (towards the head) there is a progressive sensory and motor impairment. Sensory impairment is higher than motor impairment.  
  
The Bromage Scale is commonly used to assess efferent (motor function)It permits us to assess both the spread and degree of motor block in the lumbo-sacral distribution.  
  
**Bromage Scale and C-section  
**Bromage grade 3 = patient is unable to perform a straight leg raiseThis means the spinal anesthetic block has reached the high lumbar segment.  
The loss of afferent- sensory-pin prick should be higher and assessed up to the T-4 (nipple area).

| Grade | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | No motor block |
| 1 | Can move knees/feet, but can't raise the leg |
| 2 | Can move feet, can't raise knee and leg |
| 3 | Complete block of motor limb |
