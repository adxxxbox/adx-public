Air-Fluid Gas Exchange (AFGEX)     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Air-Fluid Gas Exchange (AFGEX)

Part of an eye procedure.  
Injection of gas, or more typically mixed gas and air, into the posterior segment of the globe.  The gases are mixed with air to neutralize their expansive properties to provide for a longer acting (than air alone) retinal tamponade. The retinal tamponade acts to hold the retina in place or temporarily seal off holes in the retina. The mixed gases disappear spontaneously once the eye doc has accomplished their purpose and the posterior segment re-fills with fluid. Post-operatively, the patients that have this injection are instructed very carefully to hold a certain position in the 24 hours post-op. Head flexed down, on the right or left side, flat on the back: these are some of the common positions these patients must maintain for the gas to help the retina reattach.
