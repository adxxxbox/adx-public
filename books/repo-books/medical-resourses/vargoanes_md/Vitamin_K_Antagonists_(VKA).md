Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA)

Warfarin is the most often prescribed VKA, but is now used less often than the novel anticoagulants that are more reliable and do NOT need routing monitoring.  
  
**VKA Indications:  
**Venous thrombosis  
Pulmonary embolism  
Thromboembolic complications from atrial fibrillation and/or cardiac valve replacement.  
Reduce risk of death, recurrent MIs, and thromboembolic events (e,g. stroke, systemic embolization) post-MI.  
  
**VKA Classes:**  
Coumarins  
1,3–indandiones  
Other  
  
**Coumarins:  
**Warfarin  
Acenocoumarol  
Coumatetralyl  
Dicoumarol  
Ethyl biscoumacetate  
Phenprocoumon  
  
**1,3-Indandiones:  
**Clorindione  
Diphenadione  
Phenindione  
  
**Other:**  
Tioclomarol  
  
VKAs inhibits vitamin K reductase, resulting in depletion of the reduced form of vitamin K (vitamin KH2). The reduced vitamin K will inhibit the synthesis of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and anticoagulant proteins C and S.  
  
This results in decreased prothrombin levels and decreases in the amount of thrombin generated and bound to fibrin. This reduces the thrombogenicity of clots.**  
  
Elimination half-lives of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors/proteins:**  
Factor II – 42-60 hours  
Factor VII - 4 to 6 hours  
Factor IX – 21 to 30 hours  
Factor X – 27-48  
Proteins C - 8 hours  
Protein S - 60 hours  
  
**For reversal:** 5-10 mf of vitamin K PO or IV  
**Urgent reversal:** FFPFFP replaces coagulation factors lowered by warfarin. It contains all coagulant factors, including II, VII, IX, and X but in diluted inactive form compared to other option.**PCCs for life-threatening bleed.  
Monitor:** PT and INR (INR is the main one)  
_Factor 7 is the first factor depleted, which is why the PT is affected before the aPTT._
