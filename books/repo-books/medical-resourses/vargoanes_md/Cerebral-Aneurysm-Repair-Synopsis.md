### Cerebral Aneurysm Repair-Synopsis

**Procedure**  
The aneurysm has a weak area in a blood vessel wall that causes the blood vessel to bulge or balloon out and sometimes leak or rupture. It may cause a subarachnoid hemorrhage or a hematoma.  
After the patient is carefully positioned, the surgeon will drill burr holes in the skull to allow entrance of the special saw called a craniotome. The surgeon cuts an outline of a bone window in the skull and exposes the dura mater. The dura is folded out of the way to expose the brain. Retractors are placed on the brain to gently open a corridor between the brain and skull. Using an operating microscope, the surgeon carefully opens the corridor, locates the artery and follows it to the aneurysm. Should rupture occur during surgery, a temporary clip can be placed across the parent artery to stop the bleeding. Literature states that vascular control may be obtained at the carotid artery in the neck through a separate incision. That may be a last resort.  
**Clipping the Aneurysm**  
Once vascular control is achieved, the aneurysm neck is prepared for clipping. One or more clips will be applied. The dome of the aneurysm is punctured with a needle to make sure blood is not filling the aneurysm. Once the clip is verified for causing total occlusion, the retractors holding the brain are removed and the dura is closed with sutures. The bone flap (the piece of skull that was removed) is put back in position and secured to the skull with titanium plates and screws. The muscles and skin are sutured back together. A turban-like soft adhesive dressing will be placed over the incision.

  
**More Notes**  
The treatment decision for observation, surgical clipping or bypass, or endovascular coiling largely depends on the aneurysm’s size, location, and neck geometry.

The less invasive nature of coiling is likely to be favored in patients who are older, are in poor health, have serious medical conditions, or have aneurysms in certain locations.
