### Combined Deficiency of Vitamin K Clotting Factors

Also called: Congenital deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors

Vitamin K congenital factor deficiency (VKCDF) is autosomal and extremely rare.  
Fewer than 30 cases of VKCDF have been diagnosed and the degree of deficiency varies among reports.  
  
**Clinical Presentation**  
A combined deficiency of clotting factors II,VII, FIX and FX (and proteins C,S and Z).  
  
**Possible causes**  
Liver disease.  
Malabsorption.  
Malnutrition.  
Medications **–** usually overdose of warfarin or warfarin derivatives.  
  
Two subtypes have been identified, deriving from mutations of two enzymes of the vitamin K cycle.  
VKCFD type1 is defined by defective GGCX activity, while VKCFD type 2 derives from functional deficiency of VKORC.  
**  
Possible Symptoms**  
A severe hemorrhage during infancy, although the degree of deficiency is highly variable.  
Also presents later in life.  
Bruising beginning at age 1 week.  
Recurrent serosanguinous oozing from the umbilical stump throughout the first months of life.  
GI Bleed.  
Bleeding in soft tissue and muscle.  
  
**Treatment**  
There are three treatments available for VKCFD.  
Vitamin K.  
Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC).  
Fresh frozen plasma (FFP).
