### Thoracotomy

A thoracotomy involves a surgical incision into the chest wall, typically made between the ribs, to access the organs within the chest cavity, such as the lungs, heart, or esophagus.

It is a very painful procedure as the surgeon may divide or break a rib if necessary.

Anesthesia management for a thoracotomy is the same as for a thoracoscopy.

**Both procedures involve the following:**

-   OLV
-   DLT with lung collapse (usually 39Fr for males and 37Fr for Females)
-   Bronchoscopy to verify proper DLT position
-   Kelly Clamp
-   Lateral position
-   ESP block
-   2 IVs
-   A-line -usually
-   Communicate with the thoracic surgeon concerning regional anesthesia preoperatively

**Common indications for thoracotomy:**

-   Lobectomy (removal of a lung lobe)
-   Wedge resection (removal of part of the lung lobe)
-   Pneumonectomy (removal of the entire lung)
-   Lung transplant
-   Trauma
-   Esophageal CA

**The thoracoscopy (VATS) procedure has been replacing the thoracotomy for less invasive procedures.**

**VATS:** Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery.

**When a thoracotomy may still be preferred:**

-   A minimally invasive approach is not feasible
-   Extensive tissue removal or reconstruction is needed
-   Patient factors preclude thoracoscopy: Severe obesity and adhesions might make thoracoscopy difficult or impossible.

Some surgeons will perform most of the procedure via VATS and then make an incision between the ribs (thoracotomy) to remove a lung lobe (lobectomy).

**Anesthesia Management:**

**Type and Crossed:** Yes, with two units of pack cells available prior to surgery.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT (Left DLT) or bronchial blocker

**Duration:** 1.5-4 hours

**EBL:** 100-500 mLs

**DLT:**

**Adult males:** 39-41Fr

**Adult female:** 35-37Fr

**Fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB):** A bronchoscope must be available in the room before induction.

-   The anesthesia provider or surgeon performs an FOB to verify the left DLT placement.
-   Make sure you securely tape the DLT because it may move out of the proper position when moving the patient's head while going into the lateral position.
-   An unsuccessful lung deflation will indicate that the DLT has moved due to positioning.

**Intubation with DLT:**

-   Be careful not to use excessive force during DLT insertion, or it may result in catastrophic airway damage.
-   Do not overinflate the bronchial balloon or main cuff.
-   Only use a 3 mL syringe to inflate the smaller bronchial balloon, as you do not want to overinflate (over-distend) it.
-   It only requires < 3 mL of air

**Large Hemostat or Kelly Clamp:** Have one available for clamping the DLT to deflate the appropriate lung.

**Regional anesthesia:**

Erector spinae plane (ESP) or Paravertebral block

**Note:** Some thoracic surgeons prefer to perform a block prior to closing.

**Thoracic Epidural:** Being replaced by the ESP block.

If the patient has a thoracic epidural, bolus it before incision.

It helps limit intra-op and post-op pain.

**IV Access:** 2 large bore, usually 18G

**A-line:** Usually

**Labs:** ABG and a CBC from the A-line preoperatively, depending on the procedure's duration and estimated blood loss (EBL).

**Foley Catheter:** Usually

**Neosynephrine Drip:** Have available

**Norepinephrine:** Have available

**Ephedrine:** Have available

**Position:** Lateral decubitus with operative side (independent) lung up.

-   An Axillary roll is needed, and the bed will be flexed with the head and feet both pointing downward.
-   Extra pillows or folded blankets between the abducted arms to elevate the head to a neutral position.
-   Avoid hyperextending the arms.

**Pressure points to check:** Eyes, ears, and genitals

-   There are usually four people simultaneously positioning the patient.
-   The surgeon will confirm placement prior to draping.
-   Ensure that nothing is pressing against the DLT, and you have easy access for clamping it.
-   Untangle the IV lines to

**For ERAS:** Maintain normothermia and normovolemia

**PONV protocol:** Dexamethasone and Ondansetron

**Fluid warmer and warming blanket:** Yes, sometimes two warming blankets.

These procedures are very prone to hypothermia, especially if it is an open chest.

**Note:** Hypothermia may inhibit hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.

**Refer to** _"One Lung Ventilation (OLV) with VATS and Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction (HPV)"_ in this app for details.

**Ventilation:** Higher peak pressures (PIP) occur with OLV.

**Ventilator mode:** Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV)

-   When the lung is down, you may need to change your ventilator setting so you don't immediately over-inflate and damage the inflated lung.
-   Many anesthesia providers immediately switch to PCV.

**Peak pressure (PIP):** < 35 cmH2O

**Plateau pressure:** < 25 cmH2O

**PEEP:** 3-8 cm H2O unless there is a bronchopleural fistula present

**Optimal tidal volume with one lung ventilation:** 4-6 mL/kg

**Note:** Normal tidal volume for two healthy lungs: 6-8 mL/kg

_Inadequate ventilator parameters above can result in atelectasis formation_

**FIO2** 0.6-1.0

**ETCO2:** Normocapnia, titrate with minute ventilation

**Hypercarbia:** Mild hypercarbia is well tolerated, except in patients with pulmonary hypertension.

**Note:** A CO2 > 70 mmHg may be associated with tachycardia, dysthymias, and cardiac depression.

**Inhalation agent:** Isoflurane, desflurane, or sevoflurane if acceptable.

Avoid N2O

If the dependent lung is healthy (with proper DLT placement), the patient should not experience desaturations.

**Resolving desaturations with OLV:**

-   Suctioning of secretions and lung recruitment maneuvers to the dependent (ventilated) lung is often, all that is required.
-   First, attempt to manually ventilate the dependent lung by applying more PIP with some inspiratory holds (pulmonary recruitment) by squeezing your bellows bag and maintaining a safe peak pressure for 2-5 second intervals.
-   Shoot for 30-40 cm H2O pressure.
-   If unsuccessful, increase the FIO2 if it is not contraindicated.
-   Consider suctioning the patient with the extra-long suction catheters packaged with the DLT.
-   If unsuccessful, inform the surgeon, and they will permit you to reinflate the independent (collapsed) lung and ventilate both lungs.
-   Once the SaO2 returns to the desired baseline, you can re-collapse the independent lung and resume OLV.
-   This may be repeated—possibly several times.

**OLV often involves Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction (HPV).**

Refer to _"Thoracoscopy-One Lung Ventilation (OLV) with and Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction (HPV)"_ for details.

**Reinflating the lung:**

-   When the case is complete, the surgeon will ask you to reinflate the collapsed lung gradually to 20-30 cmH2O.
-   This will reinflate the atelectatic areas and check for significant air leaks.
-   Resume normal ventilation for two lungs.

**Chest Tube insertion:**

-   At the end of the case, a chest tube(s) will be inserted to drain the pleural cavity and aid the lung re-expansion.
-   The surgeon may want to know how much tidal volume the patient is losing.
-   If your tidal volume is set to 700 mLs and you are only getting back 400 mLs, you are obviously losing 300 mLs.
-   This should improve when the chest tube(s) are connected to suction.

**Emergence:**

-   Remember to deflate both cuffs just prior to extubating.
-   Perform an AWAKE extubation with the head of the bed up in high fowler's position if possible.
-   Many times, we slide the patient onto their stretcher and extubate them there.
-   The stretcher seems to make it easier to extubate in high fowler's position.

**Possible complications:**

Injuries from the lateral position

Hemorrhage

Vocal Cord Damage from the DLT insertion

Infection

Thoracic duct disruption

Bronchopleural fistula

Tension pneumothorax

Acute lung injury/ARDS

Cardiac herniation

Torsion of the residual lobe

RV failure and pulmonary edema from over-hydration with resected patients.

**Note:** Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is increased in proportion to the amount of lung tissue removed.

An overhydrated patient is at risk for RV failure and pulmonary edema

**Advantages:**

Shorter hospital stays.

Decreased post-op pain and reduced usage of narcotics.

Smaller post-operative scars.

Earlier return to work compared to traditional "open" procedures.
