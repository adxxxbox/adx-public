### Esophagectomy-Transthoracic

**Indications:** Esophageal CA or Barrett’s Esophagitis  
**Procedure**  
To remove part or the entire esophagus. Two Incisions are made into the abdomen and right chest. The proximal part of the stomach and esophagus is dissected free from the surrounding tissue. The diseased part of the esophagus is removed. The stomach is stapled in a way to create a tubular shape. The stomach is pulled up through the chest so it can be anastomosed to the remaining esophagus. This new connection is an Esophagogastric Anastomosis. Lymph nodes in the neck and chest may also be removed and staged. Incisions are closed and a feeding tube is inserted.

**Anesthetic: General with a Regular ETT**  
Thoracic Epidural at T7-T8  
**Induction:** RSI; many of these patients have a poorly functional Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES) and are prone to aspiration.  
**IV Access:** 2 large bore IVs. A Central line for a CVP is optional (and not as common as it used to be).  
**A-Line:** Yes  
**EBL:** Depends on surgeon; average is 400-800mLs.  
**Duration:** 3-8 hours; depending on the surgeon.  
**Position:** Procedure starts out supine, then the patient is positioned either in left lateral or prone, then the case finishes in supine position. The case starts out in the supine position so that an esophagogastroscopy can be performed to assess precise location and extension of the diseased area.  
  
**Type and Cross**: Yes.  
**Extubation:** Some prefer to wait until the patient is in the ICU while other prefer it extubate ASAP. Remember there are fluid shifts, etc. The goal is to extubate within hours.

**Quick note:** Many surgeons will try to spare the vagus nerve branches so there is still acid production and digestive functions.
