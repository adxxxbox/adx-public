Ductal Dependent and Independent Lesions   

### Ductal Dependent and Independent Lesions

Cardiac causes of cyanosis can be divided into:  
Ductal-dependent lesions  
Ductal-independent lesions  
  
**Ductal-dependent lesions  
**These lesions require the ductus arteriosus for adequate pulmonary circulation.  
_These patients need a PDA to survive._

**Ductal-dependent lesions  
**Tetralogy of Fallot  
Tricuspid atresia or Ebstein’s anomaly  
Pulmonic atresia or stenosis  
  
**Ductal Independent Lesions**  
These result in pulmonary and systemic mixing leading to cyanosis.

This may lead the deoxygenating of arterial blood and cyanosis.

**Ductal-independent lesions**

Truncus Arteriosus

Transposition of the great arteries  
Total anomalous pulmonary venous return  
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome

**In Ductal-independent lesions, mixing typically occurs through:**  
Atrial septal defect (ASD)  
Patent foramen ovale (PFO)  
Ventricular septal defect (VSD)  
  
**Fainting or cyanotic spells**

When cyanosis occurs with exertion, emotions, and/or bearing down, this is indicative increased right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, which results in increased right-to-left shunting through intracardiac shunt (VSD, ASD).
