## Cardiac Effects From Burn

_Providing safe and effective anesthesia for burn surgery requires a fundamental understanding of the pathophysiological consequences of major burn injury._

**Early (Acute) Response**  
1\. Burn shock - hypovolemic condition due to inflammatory response pending burn magnitude.  
2\. Impaired myocontractility due to progressive inflammatory mediators and loss of plasma proteins.  
\*\*\* The goal of early fluid resuscitation is to restore intravascular volume losses; vasopressor support may or may not be necessary due to early catecholamine release

**Late (Hypermetabolic) Response**  
1\. Systemic hypertension  
2\. Tachycardia  
3\. Increased cardiac output  
\*\*\* Endogenous catecholamine levels, oxygen demand, and caloric needs may remain increased for months post-injury pending magnitude of burn.  

Burn patients have decreased cardiac output from depressed myocardial function. In addition, cardiac output can be low because of hypovolemia secondary to massive third spacing from increased capillary permeability and hypoproteinemia as well as evaporative losses.

Furthermore, pending the patient’s health and etiology or circumstances surrounding the injury (electrical, recreational drug or alcohol use, other health history), SVR may decrease due to vasoactive substance release.

The decrease in cardiac output is of importance to the anesthesia provider because most medications used for induction decrease the SVR and preload. It is important for patients with severe burn injuries to establish good vascular tone and volume.

With anesthesia, burn patients may require judicious fluid administration, vasopressor, and / or inotropic support. It is of utmost importance to avoid hypovolemia, maintain intravascular volume and global tissue perfusion. Burn patients are highly vulnerable to hypovolemia, systemic inflammation, organ ischemia, and extravascular fluid shifts. Constant re-assessment is crucial.
