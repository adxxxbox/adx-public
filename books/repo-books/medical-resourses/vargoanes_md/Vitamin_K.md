Vitamin K (phytonadione)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Vitamin K (phytonadione)

**Vitamin K antagonist drugs (VKAs, such as Warfarin)** inhibit the synthesis of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and anticoagulant proteins C and S.  
  
**The discontinuation of Warfarin and INR:  
**\- When warfarin is discontinued, the INR can drop or approach normal levels in 1-3 days.  
\- This reflects the increase in factor VII activity.  
\- However, inadequate hemostasis remains possible despite a decreased INR because Factor II has a longer _T 1/2_ .  
**Vitamin K: For reversing Warfarin.  
Note:** Literature varies on dosing; thus, always follow your medical institution’s protocols concerning vitamin K dosing for reversing warfarin.**Warfarin and elevated INR for minor surgery:  
**Anticoagulation reversal for minor procedures is generally unnecessary.There is little evidence that moderately elevated INR correlates with post-procedural bleeding after many procedures (e.g., ultrasound-guided central line placement or thoracentesis).  
  
**Intracranial hemorrhage with a patient on warfarin:  
**\- PCC should be given immediately without waiting for the INR to result.\- For urgent reversal, vitamin K administered alone is INSUFFICIENT.  
\- The liver cannot quickly produce the lacking factors.  
\- In addition to Vitamin K, the missing factors must be replaced with either FFP or PPCs.

**Reversal for hemorrhage:**  
(1) 10 mg IV vitamin K over 30 minutes plus PCC or FFP.  
(2) PCC or fresh frozen plasma  
PCC is preferred  
**Alternative:** Four units of FFP  
  
**Urgent surgery:**  
\- Anticoagulation can be reversed with 2.5 to 5 mg of vitamin K administered IV in a patient taking warfarin who requires urgent surgery.  
\- This lower dose of vitamin K is essential when anticoagulation needs to be resumed once hemostasis has been achieved after surgery.

**Extra Notes:  
Vitamin K:** Leads to the production of functional coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X previously depleted by warfarin.  
Vitamin K only works on VKAs and does not neutralize the activity of other non-VKA anticoagulants.  
  
**Vitamin K Onset:  
PO:** 12-24 hours for nonsignificant bleeding.  
**IV:** 4-12 hours for significant bleeding  
(SC and IM) not recommended.  
  
**Absence of clinical bleeding:** IV Vitamin: K – may reverse to a normal INR within 6-8 hours.  
  
**Common IV Doses of Vitamin K (phytonadione):  
Non-Urgent:  
Urgent but NOT immediate:** Patient may receive 10mg/day of Vitamin K.  
  
**PO Vitamin K:**  
Higher home doses of warfarin may require higher doses of Vitamin K to achieve a specific reduction in INR.  
Bridging therapy  
  
**Duration:  
**The duration of vitamin K is dependent on warfarin intensity.  
INR may rebound in occurring days.  
  
**Vitamin K is NOT enough when URGENT reversal is needed.**  
\- For urgent reversal, vitamin K administered alone is insufficient.  
\- The liver cannot quickly produce the lacking factors.  
\- In addition to Vitamin K, the missing factors must be replaced with either FFP or PPCs.  
**Vitamin K and anaphylaxis:  
**Intravenous vitamin K may cause an anaphylactoid response if infused rapidly.This is _exceedingly rare_ (~1/30,000 patients).This is an _anaphylactoid_ reaction (not anaphylactic), so it can be avoided by infusing the vitamin K slowly (e.g., over 30 minutes).  
  
**Anaphylactoid reaction:**  
\- Unlike an anaphylactic reaction involving IgE antibodies, it occurs when a drug directly stimulates mast cells to release histamine.  
\- Anaphylactoid reactions can present similarly to anaphylactic reactions and may be treated similarly.  
\- However, anaphylactoid reactions are generally _less_ severe and can be avoided by infusing a drug slowly.  
\- Fear of this reaction _should never_ be a barrier to giving intravenous vitamin K to patients who need it.  
  
**Other routes are inferior for emergent reversal:**  
\- Subcutaneous administration has erratic absorption.  
\- IM administration may cause hematoma formation.  
\- PO administration has slower absorption.
