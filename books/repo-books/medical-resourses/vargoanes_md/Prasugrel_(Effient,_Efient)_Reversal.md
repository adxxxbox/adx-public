### Prasugrel (Effient, Efient) Reversal

_Currently, there is a lack of specific antidotes for the growing number of new (novel) anticoagulants that are slowly replacing warfarin and heparin. For this reason, there is NO universal standard of care for the treatment of the anticoagulated bleeding patient when there is no specific antidote._

**Consult cardiology for ALL patients with coronary stents.**  
  
**Quick Notes  
**The Prasugrel active metabolite is not likely to be removed by dialysis.  
  
_Prasugrel is an irreversible antiplatelet drug (like clopidogrel) that inhibits platelet function for the lifetime of the platelets._  
  
Stronger antiplatelet effect than Clopidogrel, and has more major bleeding events.  
  
**Elimination half-life:** 7 hours  
The active metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 7 hours.  
Antiplatelet effect lasts 5‐7 days after stopping therapy (literature varies).  
  
The more recent the Prasugrel dose, the less effective platelet transfusion.  
  
**Reversal methods are similar to other P2Y12 receptor inhibitors:**  
Ticlopidine  
Ticagrelor  
Clopidogrel  
  
**Specific antidote:** None  
  
**Non-Urgent**  
Discontinue 5-10 days prior to surgery.  
Cardiology consult  
**  
Urgent (Not bleeding)- options vary among institutional protocols**  
Discontinue and find out when the last dose was.  
Cardiology or hematology consult**Evaluate platelet function:** platelet function assay  
Tranexamic Acid - 1 gram  
Desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg x 1 ( _Warning: DDAVP can lead to arterial vasospasm_ ).  
  
Consider platelet transfusion (1 unit) if > 40% inhibited prior to high risk bleeding procedures  
  
**Minor bleeding: options vary among institutional protocols  
**Cardiology or hematology consult  
  
**Evaluate platelet function:** platelet function assay  
Tranexamic Acid - 1 gram  
Desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg x 1 ( _Warning: DDAVP can lead to arterial vasospasm_ ).  
1 unit of platelets if > 40% inhibited as per platelet function assay (PFA).  
Recheck PFA 1 hour after platelet transfusion complete.  
  
**Prior to high risk bleeding procedures:**  
Consider platelet transfusion (1 unit) if > 40% platelet inhibited prior to high risk bleeding procedures.  
Recheck PFA 1 hour after platelet transfusion complete.  
  
**Severe Bleed: options vary among institutional protocols  
**Cardiology or hematology consult  
Tranexamic Acid - 1 gram  
  
**Evaluate platelet function:** platelet function assay  
Desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg x 1 ( _Warning: DDAVP can lead to arterial vasospasm_ ).  
Administer 1 unit of pheresis palatelets (1 unit = 6-10 pack) x 1 stat.  
Re-check PFA 1 hour after platelet transfusion complete.  
  
  
**Life-threatening  
**Transfuse more platelets  
Initiate massive transfusion protocols.  
FEIBA 8 to 25 units/kg or Kcentra can be considered.
