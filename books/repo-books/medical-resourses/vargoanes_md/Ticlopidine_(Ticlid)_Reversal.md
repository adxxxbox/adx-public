Ticlopidine (Ticlid) reversal    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Ticlopidine (Ticlid) reversal

_Currently, there is a lack of specific antidotes for the growing number of new (novel) anticoagulants that are slowly replacing warfarin and heparin. For this reason, there is NO universal standard of care for the treatment of the anticoagulated bleeding patient when there is no specific antidote._

**Consult cardiology for ALL patients with coronary stents.**

**Quick Notes**  
Ticlopidine is irreversible platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor (like clopidogrel).  
**Elimination half-life:** 24-36 hours  
_Irreversible antiplatelet drug that inhibits platelet function for the lifetime of the platelets._ Discontinue drug 5-10 days prior to procedure.The more recent ticlopidine dose, the less effective platelet transfusion.  
Antiplatelet effects last 5-7 days after stopping therapy.  
Inhibition takes 7-10 days to resolve as new platelets are generated.  
  
**Antidote:** None, platelet infusion.**  
  
Reversal methods are similar to other P2Y12 receptor inhibitors:**  
Clopidogrel  
Prasugrel  
Ticagrelor  
**Non-Urgent** Discontinue 5-10 days prior to surgery.  
Cardiology consult**  
  
Urgent (Not bleeding): options vary among institutional protocols**  
Discontinue and determine time of the last dose.  
Cardiology or hematology consult.**Evaluate platelet function:** Platelet function assay.  
Tranexamic acid - 1 gram  
Desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg x 1 ( _Warning: DDAVP can lead to arterial vasospasm_ ).  
Consider platelet transfusion (1 unit) if > 40% inhibited prior to high risk bleeding procedures.  
  
**Minor bleeding: options vary among institutional protocols  
**Cardiology or hematology consult.  
  
**Evaluate platelet function:** Platelet function assay.  
Tranexamic acid- 1 gram  
Desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg x 1 ( _Warning: DDAVP can lead to arterial vasospasm_ ).  
1 unit of platelets if > 40% inhibited as per platelet function assay (PFA).  
Recheck PFA 1 hour after platelet transfusion complete.  
  
**Prior to high risk bleeding procedures:**  
Consider platelet transfusion (1 unit) if > 40% platelet inhibited prior to high risk bleeding procedures.  
Recheck platelet function assay 1 hour after platelet transfusion complete.  
  
**Severe Bleed: options vary among institutional protocols.  
**Cardiology or hematology consult.  
Tranexamic acid - 1 gram.  
  
**Evaluate platelet function:** Platelet function assay.  
Desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg x 1 ( _Warning: DDAVP can lead to arterial vasospasm_ ).  
Administer 1 unit of apheresis platelets (1 unit = 6-10 pack) x 1 stat.  
Re-check PFA 1 hour after platelet transfusion complete.  
  
**Life-threatening  
**Transfuse more platelets.  
Initiate massive transfusion protocols.  
FEIBA 8 to 25 units/kg or Kcentra can be considered.  
  
**_Warning:_** _Thrombotic and thromboembolic events may occur with high doses of PCCs and may result in death. Patients must be monitored following administration._
