### Extracapsular versus Intracapsular Tonsillectomy

A tonsillectomy can be broadly divided into 2 major categories:  
**Extracapsular** (total tonsillectomy, subcapsular).  
**Intracapsular** (partial tonsillectomy, subtotal).

**Extracapsular** (total tonsillectomy, subcapsular):  
Dissecting the entire tonsil from its surrounding fascia - like shelling out a grape, skin and all. This exposes the underlying pharyngeal musculature, which causes more bleeding. The bleeding is usually cauterized, ligated by sutures, and then topically covered with thrombin to promote coagulation. Studies show that this procedure is more painful with healing than intracapsular.

**Intracapsular** (partial tonsillectomy, subtotal):  
The removal of most of the tonsil, while preserving a rim of lymphoid tissue and tonsillar capsule. This method is less invasive than **extracapsular**.  
Instead of stripping out the whole tonsil and capsule, the tonsil flesh is removed from within the capsule, which is left in place. This is why it is termed we **intracapsular**.

The major advantage of this procedure is that it causes fewer traumas to the pillars and mucosa of the oropharynx, uvula and soft palate.

The tough capsule, which is left in place at the back of the throat, heals over quickly. And because the underlying sensitive muscle and large blood vessels are not encountered, it recovers more quickly with less pain and lower risks of post op bleeding. With an experienced ENT surgeon, this method allows removal of virtually all of the tonsil tissue, right onto the capsule; so in reality, it's not really a partial tonsillectomy.

The major advantage of this procedure is that it causes fewer traumas to the pillars and mucosa of the oropharynx uvula and soft palate.
