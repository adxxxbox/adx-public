### Aortogram or Arteriogram Run Off

\-These are arteriograms of the lower abdominal aorta/renal and/or arteries in the legs.

\-This exam is to search for a suspected arterial clot/occlusion.

\-The endovascular surgeon inserts catheters via the groin to visualize the targeted vessels under fluoroscopy.

\-This procedure is done on a narrow bed under fluoroscopy.

\-You will need a lead apron.

**Preop hydration:**

\-Some endovascular surgeons will preoperatively order 1 liter of normal saline to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy caused by the IV contrast.

\-Hydration is important.

**\-Contrast-induced nephropathy:** Acute kidney injury attributable to the administration of iodinated contrast.

**Possible HCO3 continuous infusion to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy:**

\-No longer common and vascular surgeon dependent.

**\-Preop:** First thing, find out the patient's level of Creatinine (Cr).

\-If the Cr >1, the patient may require a second IV for an HCO3 drip.

\-This depends on the ordering physician.

\-I have also seen some institutions insert one IV with the HCO3 drip piggybacked to a single IV.

\-This is usually the preop RN's responsibility.

\-Know the CR level because many surgeons will ask for the level.

\-See more notes towards the bottom of this page.

**Check for contrast (iodinated) allergies:**

\-Patients with an established contrast allergy (either to iodinated contrast or Gadolinium-containing contrast) may require a prophylactic premedication regimen to help reduce the likelihood and severity of an allergic reaction.

\-Most contrast allergies are anaphylactoid rather than anaphylactic.

\-Note: Shellfish allergies are not related to iodinated contrast; the allergan is the shellfish tropomyosin and not the contrast.

\-Physicians routinely do not routinely withhold contrast administration in such patients.

**Preop allergic prophylaxis for patients allergic to IV contrast (H1 and H2 antagonists)**

25 mg of Diphenhydramine (Benadryl)

20 mg of Famotidine (Pepcid)

100 mg of Solu-Cortef (Hydrocortisone)

**Duration:** It depends on what the doctor finds- 30 minutes to hours.

**Positioning:** Supine with arms tucked.

\-Ask the patient if they are comfortable lying supine, as some patients have limitations due to a history of back pain.

\-Pain relief may be required.

**Heparin Available:** Yes (usually one small dose for short cases)

**Blood Loss:** 10-80 mLs.

**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.

\-If there is just one IV, ensure it runs well when that arm is tucked.

\-The surgeon will not be happy if you stop the procedure and untuck the patient's arm to start a new IV.

**Fentanyl:**

\-Fentanyl (low-dose narcotics) may be beneficial because many patients become uncomfortable on the table and complain of back pain.

\-This is not a procedure for a squirmy patient.

**Anesthetic:** It depends on whether the vessel of interest is the abdominal/renal or lower extremity.

For only scanning the abdominal/renal vessels:

\- Light MAC and able to follow commands.

\- The surgeon usually wants the patient awake enough to follow commands.

\- Deep sedation is sometimes associated with involuntary jerky movements.

\-At the end of expiration (from a deep breath upon command), the patient is usually motionless and it is a good time for the endovascular surgeon to inject the dye.

**Note:** Informing the patients that they will need to follow commands for taking deep breaths and it is not a painful procedure may be appreciated by the patient.

**A sample of possible cocktails for light MAC:** For patient-responsiveness

\- 50-100 mcg of fentanyl and 30 mg bolus of propofol just prior to local injection.

\- 0.4 mcg/kg/hour of precedex and titrate to effect

\- 50-100 mcg of fentanyl followed by a very low dose a continuous propofol or precedex infusion

\- Low dose propofol infusion and titrate to effect (25 -50 mcg/kg/hr)

\- 4 mcg bolus of precedex as needed and 50 -100 mcg of fentanyl prior to local injection

**Scanning a lower extremity:** Deep MAC, as the patient does not need to be responsive.

**Procedure pain:** Very little, mostly from the initial local injection in the groin (catheter insertion site).

Many patients complain more about back pain or lying flat than the procedure itself.

**Pulse Ox:** Consider a disposable finger sensor or tape the nondisposable sensor to the patient's finger.

The patient's arms are tucked, and it is difficult to access and correct the pulse-ox sensor if the patient gets fidgety and the sensor becomes displaced.

**Prevention of Contrast-Induced Nephropathy with a HCO3 infusion:**

\-When the Cr >1, a HCO3 drip is warranted to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy.

\-Many patients are already on the drip in Holding, so you should know the protocol and when the drip started.

\-You may have to decrease the rate after the first hour.

**Common HCO3 Protocol:** (may vary)

HCO3 bolus of 3 mL/kg/hr x 1 hr before iopamidol contrast, followed by an infusion of 1 mL/kg/hr x 6 hr.
