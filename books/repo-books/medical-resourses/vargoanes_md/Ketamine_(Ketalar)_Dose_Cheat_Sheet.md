### Ketamine Dose Cheat Sheet

**Adult doses:**  
**For premedication:** Rare  
**When administering ketamine, consider the coadministration of:**  
**Glycopyrrolate:** To diminish the production of copious secretions.  
**Midazolam:** To decrease the likelihood of emergence delirium.

| Indication | Route | Dose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Preemptive anesthesia | IV | 10-20 mg |
| Same as above | Oral | 10 mg/kg, It is usually mixed in cherry syrup  
or soda to facilitate ingestion. |
| Induction | IV | 1-2 mg/kg IV (onset 30-60 seconds) |
| Induction | IM | 4-8 mg/kg IM (onset 2-4 minutes) |
| Intense analgesia  
(subanesthetic) | IV | 0.2-0.5 mg/kg IV |
| Same as above | IM | 0.44mg/kg, does not cause loss of consciousness  
or psychic disturbances. |
| ERAS  
procedures | IV | 5-10 mg boluses up to 0.5 mg/kg throughout the procedure.  
A small bolus prior to incision is common.  
Note: Small doses are useful adjuvants to opioid analgesia. |
| TIVA with proprofol | IV | 10 mg boluses as needed  
Administering subanesthetic doses of ketamine with propofol for  
TIVA production is not uncommon. |
| TIVA  
continuous  
infusion | IV | 0.5 mg/kg loading dose followed by  
15-30 mcg/kg/min has been used historically in  
patents with CAD |
| Continuous  
infusion | IV | **For preventing and reversing morphine-induced tolerance.**  
0.3 mg/kg/hour (subanesthetic) reduces the likelihood of opioid  
tolerance and improves analgesia. |

_**Neuraxial ketamine (rare):** Controversial and rarely used.  
**Intrathecal and epidural injections** may frequently result in psychodysleptic effects.  
Neuraxial ketamine is rare in clinical practice, but there is literature on the following doses below from previous studies.  
  
**Intrathecal (rare):** 5-50 mg in 3 mL of saline, but not approved for analgesia.  
Intrathecal ketamine produces only variable and brief analgesia unless combined with epinephrine to slow systemic absorption.  
  
**Epidural** **(rare):**  
Epidural effects of ketamine are relatively small, but in combination with other epidural analgesics (opioids, local anesthetics), an additive or synergistic effect may occur.  
  
**FDA approved dose ranges are higher than clinical ranges:  
**The dose ranges of ketamine as per “Access.Data.FDA.gov” are much higher than  
the common perioperative doses used today.  
FDA dose ranges from the package insert are at the bottom of this page.  
  
**First-pass metabolism with oral and rectal routes of administration.  
**Due to ketamine’s extensive first-pass metabolism, rectal and oral formulations have limited bioavailability with relatively high concentrations of the active (but less-potent) metabolite norketamine.  
However, these routes are still effective for causing sedation.  
  
**Ketamine in infants < 3 months of age is an absolute contraindication:**  
The American College of Emergency Physicians considers the use of ketamine in infants <3 months of age to be an absolute contraindication due to the higher risk of airway complications (ACEP \[Green 2011\]).  
  
**Pediatric doses of ketamine:** table.tableizer-table { font-size: 12px; border: 1px solid #CCC; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; } .tableizer-table td { padding: 4px; margin: 3px; border: 1px solid #CCC; } .tableizer-table th { background-color: #104E8B; color: #FFF; font-weight: bold; }

| Indication | Route | Dose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Premedication for invasive procedures | PO | 4-6 mg/kg and usually combined with atropine (per Colte and Lerman, 2022)  
5-6 mg/kg alone will sedate most children within 12 minutes.  
Larger oral doses of 8 mg/kg -prolonged recovery from anesthesia.  
Up to 10 mg/kg is common for burn procedures  
It is usually mixed in cherry syrup or soda to facilitate ingestion. |
| Same as above | With PO  
midazolam | 3 mg/kg ketamine and 0.5 mg/kg of midazolam provide more effective  
preoperative sedation than either drug alone.  
It does not prolong recovery after surgical procedures that last more than 30 minutes. |
| Same as above | Nasal transmucosal  
(off-label) | 6 mg/kg (use 100mg/mL), may repeat once  
Administering half dose in each nostril.  
Doses up to 40 mg: May be reliably administered intranasally;  
Doses > 40 mg: Part of the dose will be delivered to the oropharynx  
and ingested orally due to volume limitations, which may decrease the effectiveness.  
Sedation develops within 20-40 minutes.  
It is suggested to use preservative-free ketamine. |
| Same as above | Rectal | 5 mg/kg produces good anxiolysis and sedation within 30 minutes.  
However, the rectal route may not provide reliable absorption. |
| Premedication | IM | 3-7 mg/kg  
Will calm most uncooperative children in 3-5 minutes. |
| Sedation for  
short-term procedures | IV | 0.5-2 mg/kg per dose  
Diagnostic spinal punctures and bone marrow aspiration. |
| Induction | IV | 1-3 mg/kg  
1 to 4.5 mg/kg for adolescents≥ 16 years |
| Induction | IM | 5-10 mg/kg  
10 mg/kg will induce sleep sedation for 12-25 minutes |
| Analgesic | IV | 0.1 mg/kg |
| Analgesic  
infusion | IV | 0.1-0.3 mg/kg/hour  
Improve pain control and has an opioid-sparing effect. |
| Infusion - general anesthesia | TIVA | Loading dose: 1-2 mg/kg  
Maintenance: 0.1-2.5 mg/kg/hour |
| Cardiac  
surgery | IV | 1-2 mg/kg/hour is documented but rarely used today |
| With surgery | Caudal | 0.5 mg/kg with 0.25% bupivacaine |

Peds nasal transmucosal notes:**  
It is suggested to preservative-free ketamine for this route because the preservative is neurotoxic.  
In theory, nasally administered ketamine could cause neuro tissue damage if it reaches the cribriform plate.  
  
**Doses up to 40 mg:** May be reliably administered intranasally.  
**Doses > 40 mg:** part of the dose will be delivered to the oropharynx and ingested orally due to volume limitations, which may decrease the effectiveness.  
  
**Peds IV induction:**  
**Adolescents ≥16 years:**  
**IM:** 6.5 to 13 mg/kg.  
**IV:** 1 to 4.5 mg/kg  
  
**Maintenance of anesthesia:** Adolescents ≥16 years: May administer supplemental doses of one-half to the total induction dose as needed.  
**Dose ranges of ketamine as per “Access.Data.FDA.gov”** (Package insert)  
**\- IV induction:** 1 to 4.5 mg/kg.**\- IM:** 6.5 to 13 mg/kg.  
**\- Maintenance** Repeat increments of one-half to the total induction dose as needed the for maintenance of anesthesia.  
  
**Continuous infusion:** 0.1 to 0.5 mg/minute will maintain general anesthesia in adult patients.
