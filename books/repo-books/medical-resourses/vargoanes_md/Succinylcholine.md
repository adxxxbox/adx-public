### Succinylcholine (Anectine, Quelicin), Sch or Sucs

![image39](image39.png)

Sch is structurally two molecules of acetylcholine (ACh), and it is linked by an acetate methyl group.

Thus, it acts as an ACh agonist at both postsynaptic and extrajunctional ACh receptors.

Extea Notes

**The current trend in Pediatrics is** to avoid using succinylcholine for induction whenever possible.

**Obese patients:** Have an increase in plasma cholinesterase so that you may need a larger dose of Anectine.

Succinylcholine and Hyperkalemia

In normal individuals, the increase in serum K+ is 0.5–1.0 mEq/L

It occurs within 3–5 minutes after the IV administration of succinylcholine and only lasts for less than 10–15 minutes.

However, in certain conditions, such as trauma, burns, infection, and certain neuromuscular disorders, there is an exaggerated increase in the serum K+ level that may manifest clinically in cardiac dysrhythmias and even cardiac arrest.

Fasciculations:

Succinylcholine is known to cause involuntary muscle contractions, or fasciculations, right before muscle paralysis sets in.

Some may appear violent, resulting in myalgia, after surgery.

An alternative to succinylcholine for RSI:

Due to succinylcholine's problematic side effects and multiple contraindications, rocuronium has increasingly replaced it as the paralytic of choice for rapid sequence induction.

With the availability of sugammadex for rapid reversal, the duration difference is less of a concern than it once was.

A vial of sugammadex should always be readily available for a quick reversal in case there is a "can't intubate, can't ventilate" situation.

The RSI dose of rocuronium is 1.2 mg/kg with an onset of 90 seconds.

Can a patient have an allergic reaction with their first exposure to Sux?

**Answer:** Yes

-   An allergic reaction from the first exposure to Sux would suggest a prior sensitization to a compound within rocuronium.
-   A study suggests that repetitive exposure to quaternary ammonium compounds used in hairdressing is a risk factor for sensitization muscle relaxants.
-   Hairdressers are routinely exposed to a wide range of hair products containing the quaternary ammonium compound.
-   This repeated exposure to quaternary ammonium compounds can lead to the development of IgE antibodies specific.
-   Sux contains two quaternary ammonium groups.
-   After the administration of Sux, the quaternary ammonium can act as an antigenic epitope, triggering an immune response in sensitized individuals and possibly an anaphylactic reaction.
-   One study showed that 7.4% of hairdressers had IgE antibodies to quaternary ammonium, compared to only 1.6% of non-hairdressing apprentices.
