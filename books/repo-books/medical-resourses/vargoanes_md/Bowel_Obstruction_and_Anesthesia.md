### Bowel Obstruction and Anesthesia

**Consider first reviewing the files located in the “Coexisting Diseases and Surgery” App:**  
“Large Bowel Obstruction”  
“Small Bowel Obstruction”  
“Bowel Obstruction Fluid Shifts”  
**Quick facts:  
**\- Small bowel obstruction is the most common cause of bowel obstruction.  
\- Most common cause of large bowel obstruction is colorectal cancer.  
\- 75% of large bowel obstructions ultimately require surgical intervention during the same hospital admission.  
\- Complete large bowel obstruction, closed-loop obstruction, evidence of colonic ischemia, and volvulus commonly require emergency surgical intervention.  
\- The clinical presentation of intestinal obstruction may vary enormously.  
\- Patient’s presentation varies from well-nourished with only mild dehydration to septic and hemodynamically unstable with a reduced LOC.  
  
**Concerns in bowel obstruction and anesthesia:  
**Sepsis and acidosis  
Hemodynamic instability (hypotension and tachycardia)  
Abnormal electrolytes  
Large fluid deficit  
Very high aspiration risks  
  
**These patients should have already been followed and optimized prior to surgery.  
Pre-operative optimization involves:**  
Fluid replacement with adequate urine output  
Stabilizing hemodynamics (with vasopressors if necessary)  
Correcting electrolyte abnormalitiesIf not an urgent procedure, surgery should be postponed a minimum of 4 hours until the patient is optimized.**Pre-op labs:**  
**CBC:**  
\- A leukocytosis may help differentiate simple obstruction from a strangulated and perforated bowel.  
\- Leukocyte counts of >25,000 dl–1 suggest mesenteric occlusion or perforation.  
\- Hct > 55% indicates a large fluid shift and hypovolemia.  
Preoperative anemia, mainly iron deficiency, is common in colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease patients.  
**  
BMP:  
**Deficiency of individual electrolytes can suggest the site of obstruction.  
\- Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypovolemia, or hypophosphatemia are more likely in large bowel obstruction. In bowel ischemia, there can be an accumulation of lactic acid and release of intracellular K+ resulting in metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia.  
\- Electrolyte abnormalities must be corrected.  
  
**Lactate levels:** Elevated levels may indicate possible mesenteric and/or colonic ischemia or bowel strangulation.  
  
**ABGs** can immediately assess acid-base status.  
\- Metabolic alkalosis results from frequent emesis.  
\- Metabolic acidosis can result from bowel ischemia (directly related to obstruction) or associated severe dehydration.  
  
**Coags:** Consider thromboembolism prophylaxis.  
**Renal:** Urine specific gravity of 1.025 to 1.030 and increased BUN/Cr reflect the degree of extracellular volume loss.  
  
**Sepsis:  
**\- Sepsis is usually NOT present in the early stages of bowel obstruction as it is in the later stages.\- Sepsis is commonly associated with a decrease in SVR requiring vasopressor support.  
\- ICU sepsis protocols include continuous infusions of norepinephrine and vasopressin.  
\- If the patient is already on vasopressors, these are to be continued intraoperatively and titrated as needed.

| --- | --- |
| **Sepsis** | Temperature >38°C or < 36°C  
HR > 90 BPM  
Ventilatory frequency >20 BPM or PaC02 < 33 mmHg  
WBC<4000/mL or >12,000/mL or >10% immature forms  
Clinical evidence of infection |
| **Severe sepsis** | Sepsis is associated with organ dysfunction, hypotension  
(SAP < 90 mmHg or < 40% mmHg from baseline)  
and hypoperfusion abnormalities. |
| **Septic shock** | Sepsis-induced hypotension despite fluid resuscitation,  
with hypoperfusion abnormalities. |

  
  
**Fluid imbalance with intestinal obstruction:  
**Degree of hypovolemia can be estimated by the degree of bowel obstruction. table.tableizer-table { font-size: 12px; border: 1px solid #CCC; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; } .tableizer-table td { padding: 4px; margin: 3px; border: 1px solid #CCC; } .tableizer-table th { background-color: #104E8B; color: #FFF; font-weight: bold; }

| Early stage | Well established stage | Late stage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1,500 mL of fluid accumulation  
in the bowel | 3,000 mL of fluid accumulation  
in the bowel | 6,000 mL of fluid accumulation  
in the bowel |
| Mild dehydration | Usually associated with vomiting  
Mild to severe dehydration | Hypotension and tachycardia  
are normally present  
Elevated Hct  
Severe dehydration  
_HCT > 55% indicates that 40% of plasma and  
extracellular fluid volume has been lost._ |

  
\- Ideally, the patient will have been hydrated in the ICU or emergency department prior to surgery.  
\- Fluid replacement will help normalize systemic vascular resistance and optimize oxygen delivery.  
**  
Crystalloid or colloid?  
**\- There is no gold standard or “magic formula” for fluid resuscitation.  
\- Most providers administer both albumin and LR.  
\- Vigorous IV fluid replacement may be required because of the loss of absorptive capacity, decreased oral intake and vomiting.  
\- Colloids are now increasingly used more in bowel surgery.  
\- Concomitant hypo-albuminemia can exacerbate the loss of fluid from the vascular space.  
\- Stroke volume measurement using noninvasive monitoring is becoming more common clinically for goal-directed fluid administration.  
**Warning:** Irrational and unmonitored fluid boluses to manage hypotension or low urine output may lead to fluid overload.  
  
**Nasogastric tube (NGT):  
**\- An NGT should have already been inserted when the bowel obstruction was initially assessed.\- A nasogastric tube will help decompress the stomach and reduce the risk of aspiration.  
\- If the patient does not have an NGT, one should be inserted prior to induction.  
  
**Regional anesthesia:  
**\- Thoracic epidurals are rarely performed for the surgical repairs of bowel obstructions.  
\- Epidurals are controversial in the presence of sepsis and large fluid deficits.  
\- The placement of a thoracic epidural with a bolus of 6-8 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine with fentanyl or morphine prior to induction with continued doses in the postoperative period is acceptable and evidence-based.  
\- Regional anesthesia alone has been successfully used in patients with pulmonary compromise.  
\- TAP block may be considered for open abdominal procedures.  
  
**These patients are at very high risk for aspiration.  
**\- Suction and oropharyngeal suction attachment should be readily accessible near the patient’s airway.  
\- NGT should be connected to suction prior to induction to empty the patient’s stomach.  
**  
Pre-op meds:  
**\- Avoid prokinetics (e.g., metoclopramide) because it may aggravate the bowel obstruction and increase the risk of perforation.  
\- If time permits, antacids (e.g., sodium citrate) and/or H2 antagonists (e.g., famotidine \[Pepcid®\]) may be considered for a PARTIAL bowel obstruction.  
**Induction:** RSI with Sellick maneuver**Induction position:** Controversial  
  
**Positioning:** Controversial  
Some anesthesia providers prefer to elevate the head of the bed to avoid passive regurgitation.  
**Position the patient in Trendelenburg if aspiration occurs;** however, this is rarely done.  
**Monitoring:** Central line and arterial line are indicated for hemodynamically unstable patients.  
\- A central line and CVP are optimal; however, these are currently less commonly used.  
\- Arterial lines are usually inserted in the ICU when vasopressors are being infused.**Foley catheter** is necessary to monitor urine output.  
**Fluid warmer or warming blanket:** Necessary to avoid hypothermia, especially in open abdominal procedures.  
**Nitrous oxide** is to be avoided.  
**Muscle relaxant reversal:** Sugammadex is preferred over neostigmine.  
**Mechanical ventilation:** Pressure Control ventilation (PCV) may be indicated to avoid excessive peak airway pressures secondary to distended bowel and upward displacement of the diaphragm.  
  
**Extubation: Awake**  
**Factors that may prevent extubation:  
**Severe acidosis  
Hemodynamic instability  
V/Q mismatch  
Symptoms of aspiration  
  
**Possible surgical complications:  
**Adhesion formationFluid and electrolyte imbalanceAspiration pneumonitis  
Bowel Ischemia  
Bowel perforation, leading to peritonitis (high mortality)  
Infection  
Formation of abscesses  
Leakage of stool from the anastomosis  
Paralytic ileus (temporary paralysis of the intestines)  
Sepsis with multiorgan failure  
Dehydration and renal impairment  
Hemorrhage  
Atelectasis  
Recurrence of the obstruction
