### ORIF of the Acetabulum

Whenever you hear Pelvic or Acetabulum fracture you should think of bleeding. That  
area is very vascular. Some surgeons prefer a cell saver on stand by.   
Acetabulum is a Latin word meaning a small vinegar cup. The Acetabulum is a cup-shaped cavity at the base of the hipbone into which the ball-shaped head of the femur fits. The acetabulum is really is part of the pelvis and hip joint. Skeletal traction with a femoral traction pin is usually done until external fixation can be performed. If the fracture cannot be repaired, a THA can be done.

There are three different approaches the surgeon can make-anterior, lateral or posterior.  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT. A spinal is not common due to painful repositioning. Propofol may be required for positioning the patient lateral for the spinal.  
**Position:** Usually supine or lateral.  
**Neo drip:** Usually.  
**A-Line:** Consider one, unless they are young and healthy.  
**Induction**: Usually on the patient’s bed due to traction or too much pain to move the patient to the OR bed.  
**EBL:** 300-1,000 mLs.

**IV Access:** 1-2 18G  
**Type and Screened:** yes  
**Duration:** 2-4 hours

**Complications**

Excessive Bleeding.  
DVTs-: Pelvic and acetabular fractures are high risk for DVT.  
Sciatic Nerve Injury.  
Ileus  
Avascular necrosis.  
Sacroiliac pain.

 **More Notes**

Mostly in males < 30 years.Of the 10 types of acetabular fractures, the posterior wall fracture is often associated with the highest incidence of post-traumatic arthritis.Surgery may be done to repair nonunion or malunion of the acetabulum.The acetabulum can be Anterior Wall, Posterior Wall, Transverse and Posterior Column fractures. Fractures treated after 21 days are more difficult to reduce & have poorer outcomes.

**Femur Fractures**

Hip fractures are classified by anatomic location and can be categorized as Femoral Neck Fractures, intertrochanteric fractures and subtrochanteric fractures. 

Some systems refer to proximal, mid-shaft and distal femoral fractures. Distal femoral fractures are further sub classified into: supracondylar fractures which are within 9cms of the distal femoral articular surface.
