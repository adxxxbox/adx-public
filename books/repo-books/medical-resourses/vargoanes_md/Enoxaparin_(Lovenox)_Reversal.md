### Enoxaparin (Lovenox) Reversal

_Warning: There are presently NO standardized guidelines for the management of a hemorrhage with patients on Lovenox._

**Consult cardiology for ALL patients with coronary stents.**  
  
**Quick Notes:  
**Enoxaparin is a LMWH  
**Enoxaparin (Lovenox** **) - half-life:** 4.5 hours  
**Subcutaneous injection:** half-life is prolonged.  
  
**Other LMWH all have similar reversal methods:  
**Dalteparin  
Tinzaparin  
  
**Low Molecular Weight Heparin Reversal of Bleeding (literature varies)  
**Protamine sulfate may be used as a PARTIAL reversal agent (neutralizes approximately 60% of LMWH’s anti‐ factor Xa activity).  
LMWH **\-** major bleeding occurs in 1-4% depending on dose and underlying condition.  
  
**Antidote:** Protamine (only partial-as stated above).  
Andexanet alfa-awaiting FDA approval.  
  
**Protamine Doses for reversal of Enoxaparin  
Last enoxaparin** **dose given within 8 hours:** 1mg protamine per 1mg Enoxaparin given.  
**Last enoxaparin** **dose given within 8-12 hours:** 0.5mg protamine per 1mg enoxaparin given.  
  
Repeat dose 0.5 mg protamine for every 1 mg of 1mg enoxaparin given if bleeding continues or elevated anti‐factor Xa activity level after 2‐4 hours.  
  
**Protamine Facts:**  
Maximum single dose is 50mg.  
Never bolus-may result in profound HYPOtension.  
  
**Protamine Allergy:**  
Increased risk of hypersensitivity reaction, including anaphylaxis, in patients with a fish allergy or prior exposure to protamine.  
Premedicate with corticosteroids and antihistamines if at risk for protamine allergy.  
  
**Enoxaparin Therapeutic Ranges (target anti-Xa levels measured 4 hours after dosing):**  
Therapeutic bid dosing 0.6-1.0  
Therapeutic Q Day dosing >1.  
  
**Lab Monitoring  
AntiXa Activity (LMWH) assay:** Most reliable.  
**Optional Labs:** PTT, ACT, or TEG  
**APTT:** Only slightly affected  
  
**AntiXa Activity (LMWXA) monitoring with LMWH (when needed)**  
If measuring is desired, check peak antiXa level 3-4 hours after dose.  
Observed peak AntiXa levels for Q12h dosing of LMWHs = 0.5-1 units/mL.  
Observed peak antiXa levels for Q24h dosing of LMWHs = 1-2 units per mL.  
You can also check trough antiXa levels prior to the next dose = < 0.5 units/mL.  
Elevated troughs suggest impaired clearance.  
aPTT displays a linear dose-respone to LMWH but, there is still variations.  
  
**LMWH Therapeutic Ranges (target anti-Xa levels measured 4 hours after dosing):**  
  
**Enoxaparin (Lovenox)**  
Therapeutic BID dosing 0.6-1.0.  
Therapeutic Q-day dosing >1.0.  
  
**Nonurgent**  
Hold LMWH the day of procedure  
**Once-daily regimens:** May consider ½ dose day prior to procedure.  
**Twice-daily regimens:** Hold evening dose day prior and morning of procedure.  
  
**Urgent: No major bleeding  
**Wait 12-24 hours if possible.  
Consider protamine sulfate if a delay not possible for high bleeding risk procedures.  
  
**Life-threatening Bleed:**  
Hematology/Coagulation consult is recommended.  
Protamine sulfate.  
FEIBA 8 to 25 units/kg or Kcentra can be considered.  
rVIIa - no proven role.  
FFP - no proven role.
