## Laryngospasm and Negative Pressure Pulmonary Edema (NPPE)

_(Administer Succinylcholine Early?)_

**Remember:** The small dose of succinylcholine (0.1 mg/kg) is enough to break a laryngospasm, while preserving spontaneous ventilation in an adult.

Negative pressure pulmonary edema (NPPE) is a rare, but potentially life-threatening complication of general anesthesia. It mostly occurs during emergence from anesthesia associated with a laryngospasm.

**Muscular Males and NPPE**  
Literature clearly states that young muscular males are more prevalent to acquire NPPE as a result of a laryngospasm.

Young, healthy, muscular patients, have the ability to generate high amounts of negative intrathoracic pressures during an obstructing event. Because of the patient's strength, every negative inspiratory effort against a closed glottis may contribute to NPPE. For obvious reasons, this is one patient population where immediate relief a laryngospasm is necessary.

With the onset of a laryngospasm, succinylcholine is not our first choice of treatment. However, one must consider administering succinylcholine combined with mask CPAP/jaw thrust on these high-risk patients during the onset of a laryngospasm.

If you utilized mask CPAP (without succinylcholine) with a jaw thrust, and it took longer than expected to break the laryngospasm, resulting in NPPE, you may wonder if the results would have been different if you immediately administered a small dose of succinylcholine. You may never know.

**The three most popular methods we presently utilize in the anesthesia to break a laryngospasm perioperatively is:**  
**CPAP/Jaw thrust** with a tight seal using the anesthesia mask  
**Propofol -**0.5 mg/kg increments  
**Succinylcholine** 0.1mg/kg (1/2cc is quicker and more popular)

From my experience, positive pressure (CPAP) with a jaw thrust is mostly everyone’s first choice. The anesthesia mask is accessible and quick to apply. Unfortunately, this method does not always work, and may lead to oxygen desaturation, awareness, and negative pressure pulmonary edema. You may ask yourself, “What if I immediately administered ½ cc (10mg) of succinylcholine early in the struggle to break the laryngospasm?” Would this have helped? It may have

**Possible example**  
Take the situation of a large muscular male with a large skull that starts to experience a laryngospasm. You already know that he would be prone to negative pressure pulmonary edema from the known statistics with his muscular stature. As a reaction, you attempt mask CPAP, but cannot obtain an optimal seal with the mask. This is a great situation to immediately administer a small dose of succinylcholine-as long as it is not contraindicated.

You may never know, but succinylcholine may break a laryngospasm quicker than Mask CPAP/jaw thrust, preventing NPPE with high-risk muscular patients.
