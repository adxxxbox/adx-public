### Ketamine Pharmacology Notes

**Brand name:** Ketalar  
DO NOT confuse with Kenalog or ketorolac (Toradol)  
  
In the field of anesthesia, it is most commonly used as an adjuvant to decrease narcotic requirements during general anesthesia.  
  
**Street name:** Special K or K (others at the bottom of this page)  
**For ketamine doses:** Refer to _“Ketamine Doses Cheat Sheet.”_  
**For pharmacokinetics:** Refer to _“Ketamine Pharmacokinetics.”_  
**Class:** Phencyclidine derivative  
Synthetic nonbarbiturate intravenous (IV) anesthetic  
Produces “ **Dissociative anesthesia.”  
  
Recreational use:  
**\- The psychotropic effects of ketamine attracted more and more people to consume it as a recreational drug or use it as a date rape drug.  
**\- Date rape drug:** Ketamine may be used in drug-facilitated sexual assaults because of its sedative and dissociative properties.  
\- The DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) listed ketamine as a Schedule III non-narcotic substance under the Controlled Substances Act in 1999.  
\- The most common route of recreational administration is nasal insufflation, with an onset of feeling “high” ranging between 5 and 10 minutes and lasting between 40 and 75 minutes.  
\- Overall, there is no report, to our knowledge, involving a lethal dose of ketamine in humans.   
\- The most common source of smuggling into the US is from Mexico.  
  
**Clinical use of ketamine:**  
Ketamine is widely used in clinical settings because of its profound analgesic, sedative, dissociative and amnestic effects while maintaining protective airway reflexes, spontaneous respirations, and cardiopulmonary stability.  
  
**Dissociative anesthesia:** “The lights are on, but no one's home.”  
\- Ketamine produces a functional dissociation between the thalamocortical and limbic systems, a state that has been termed dissociative anesthesia.   
\- Dissociative anesthesia resembles a cataleptic state in which the eyes remain open with a slow nystagmic gaze.  
\- The patient is noncommunicative; despite appearing awake, their eyes open but exhibit no apparent response to surgical pain.  
  
**Ketamine is a unique and popular drug in anesthesia practice because it provides the following:**  
Amnesia  
Intense analgesia  
Dissociative anesthesia  
Does not depress the respiratory system (apnea)  
Does not depress the cardiovascular system (bradycardia or hypotension)No other drug used in clinical practice provides the outcomes listed above.  
  
**Why we don’t use ketamine all the time.**  
\- The biggest drawback of ketamine is that it may induce severe psychomimetic reactions, namely hallucinations, **emergence delirium,** nightmares, and altered short-term memory and cognition.  
\- The larger the dose, the higher the risk for adverse side effects.  
\- Recovery room nurses are also not fond of patients waking up screaming or appearing to be zoned out.  
  
**Emergence delirium:** (postoperative confusional states or agitation)  
\- Emergence delirium occurs in 5% to 30% of patients during the recovery period and is partially dose-dependent.  
\- Manifestations vary in severity between pleasant dream-like states, morbid content, vivid color, hallucinations, and emergence delirium.  
\- Dreams and hallucinations can occur up to 24 hours after the administration of ketamine.  
\- Many patients have recalled this as an unpleasant experience.  
_\- The frequency of emergence delirium limits the clinical usefulness of ketamine as a sole agent.  
  
_**Factors associated with an increased incidence of emergence delirium include:**  
Age: Older than 15 and less than age 65.  
Female gender  
High doses of ketamine greater than 2 mg/kg IV  
History of personality problems or frequent dreaming.  
Rapid IV administration  
Excessive noise or stimulation during recovery  
Ketamine monotherapy (concurrent use with a benzodiazepine may reduce risk)  
  
**Prevention of emergence delirium:**  
\- Pretreat with the benzodiazepine midazolam IV, about 5 minutes before induction of anesthesia with ketamine.  
\- Avoid high doses  
\- Midazolam is more effective than diazepam in preventing the emergence delirium.  
\- Maintain a quiet environment with the emergence  
\- Avoid monotherapy, also administer a benzodiazepine (midazolam)  
  
**Indications of ketamine:  
**\- As the sole anesthetic agent for diagnostic and surgical procedures that do not require skeletal muscle relaxation.  
\- For the induction of anesthesia prior to administering other general anesthetic agents.  
\- As a supplement to other anesthetic agents.  
  
**Mechanism of action:  
**The mechanism for induced analgesia and dissociative anesthesia is unknown.  
**Ketamine interacts with the following CNS receptors:  
**\- Antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors  
\- Opioid receptors (ketamine is unresponsive to naloxone)  
\- Monoaminergic receptors  
\- Muscarinic receptors  
\- Voltage-sensitive sodium receptors  
\- L-type calcium channels  
\- Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors  
\- GABA A receptors (only weak actions)  
\- Dopaminergic receptors (D2)-Recent literature also indicates ketamine may stimulate D2 receptors in vitro.  
  
**N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA):  
**\- Ketamine non-competitively binds to the phencyclidine site inside the NMDA receptor and blocks the influx of calcium, resulting in a decrease in the presynaptic release of glutamate.  
\- The antagonism of NMDA receptors is responsible for the specific ketamine properties (amnesic and psycho-sensory effects, analgesia, and neuroprotection)  
\- Ketamine-produced blockade of NMDA receptors depend on the opening state of the calcium ion channel in the NMDA receptor.  
\- The varying composition of NMDA receptor subunits determines temporal and regional specificity and unique functional properties.  
**  
Opioid receptors:**  
The literature varies upon which opioid receptor ketamine directly interacts.  
in humans, this analgesic effect is not antagonized by naloxone.  
However, some psychic effects may involve kappa opioid receptors.  
  
**Monoaminergic Receptors:  
**It activates the descending inhibitory monoaminergic pain pathways resulting in antinociceptive properties (alters the detection of a painful or injurious stimulus).  
There is also prolonged synaptic action, leading to an increased transfer of norepinephrine in the circulation.  
  
**Muscarinic receptors:  
**\- Ketamine has antagonist effects on muscarinic receptors resulting in emergence delirium, bronchodilation, and sympathomimetic action.  
\- Ketamine anesthesia is partially antagonized by anticholinesterase drugs (neostigmine and physostigmine).  
  
**Sodium Channels:  
**\- Ketamine interacts with voltage-gated sodium channels resulting in mild local anesthetic–like properties.  
\- It is an efficient local analgesic agent that can be used in topical applications (rare).  
\- They both share the same binding sites.  
**  
Neuronal Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors:**  
The nicotinic inhibition by ketamine does not appear to affect sedation or immobility but may play a role in its analgesic effects.  
  
**Ketamine has anti inflammatory properties:  
**\- Ketamine may be able to prevent exacerbation of inflammation and also reduce existing inflammation.  
\- When administered during or prior to surgical operations, it has been used for a more favorable postoperative outcome, primarily due to its anti-inflammatory effects.  
\- Its direct inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines may also contribute to the analgesic effects.  
Ketamine reduces proinflammatory cytokines by inhibiting the protein nuclear kappa B, the protein responsible for producing the cytokines.  
\- It also activates the innate repair receptor “CD131-erythropoietin receptor complex, which relieves neuropathic pain from peripheral nerve injury.  
\- Another anti-inflammatory effect via suppressing the induction of NO synthase activity, and protein expression by endotoxin exerts a protective anti-inflammatory effect against the sepsis process.  
\- Ketamine has also been shown to correct abnormal inflammatory bone markers in major depressive disorder.  
**  
Other benefits of ketamine:**  
\- Ketamine inhibits tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 gene expressions in macrophages.  
\- NMDA receptor blockade by ketamine inhibits extracellular signal-regulated kinase ½ pathway and proliferation of carcinoma cells by cell cycle arrest.  
\- It has prolonged antidepressant effects.  
  
**Avoid the risk of ketamine as being the sole anesthetic used for procedures of the:**  
Pharynx  
Larynx  
Bronchial Tree  
  
\- Pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes are NOT suppressed with ketamine when used alone.  
\- Ketamine may also cause copious amounts of thick secretions in those areas.  
\- Muscle relaxants may be required.  
  
**Hemodynamic effects of ketamine:  
**Increases systemic and pulmonary arterial blood pressure  
Increases heart rate  
Increases cardiac output  
Increases cardiac work  
Increases myocardial oxygen requirements  
  
\- Elevation of blood pressure reaches a maximum within a few minutes of injection and usually returns to preanesthetic values within 15 minutes.  
\- In the majority of cases, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure peaks from 10% to 50% above preanesthetic levels shortly after induction of anesthesia, but the elevation can be higher or longer in individual cases.  
\- The cardiovascular-stimulating effects above are often blunted by the prior administration of midazolam or concomitant administration of other IV and inhaled anesthetics.  
  
**Ketamine is a direct myocardial depressant.**  
\- **Ketamine is a mild negative cardiac inotrope.**  
\- However, ketamine’s negative cardiac inotrope effects are usually negligible and overshadowed by central sympathetic outflow.  
  
**Mechanisms for ketamine-induced cardiovascular effects:  
**\- Ketamine directly stimulates the CNS resulting in an increased sympathetic nervous system outflow  
\- An increase in plasma concentrations of epinephrine and norepinephrine occurs as early as 2 minutes after IV administration of ketamine and returns to control levels 15 minutes later.  
  
**Critically ill patients and hypotension:**  
\- Some critically ill patients have a depletion of endogenous catecholamine stores and an exhausted sympathetic nervous system compensatory mechanism resulting in hypotension following the administration of ketamine, thus unmasking its direct myocardial depressant effects.  
  
**Ketamine and the respiratory system:  
**\- Respiratory depression when ketamine is administered alone is very rare.  
\- Ketamine has minimal effects on the patient’s respiratory system.  
\- The patient’s respiratory rate may decrease by 2-3 breaths per minute in the first few minutes.  
\-The ventilatory response to carbon dioxide is maintained during ketamine anesthesia, and the PaCO2 is unlikely to increase more than 3 mmHg.  
\- Apnea may occur with the concomitant administration of apnea-producing analgesics.  
**\- Respiratory depression** may occur following an overdosage or too rapid a rate of administration.  
\- Maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.  
**  
Ketamine has bronchodilatory activity:**  
\- Ketamine is a bronchodilator and has been used in subanesthetic doses to treat bronchospasm in the operating room and ICU.  
Ketamine may be recommended as the IV induction drug of choice in active bronchospasm or increased airway sensitivity.  
\- The mechanism by which ketamine produces airway relaxation is unclear.  
  
**Excess secretions with ketamine:  
\- As mentioned above, ketamine** induces salivary secretions resulting in thick tenacious mucus.  
\- The thick secretions may cause coughing and laryngospasm, especially in patients with more sensitive airways.\- An antisialagogue is often recommended prior to the administration of ketamine for this very reason.  
\- Glycopyrrolate (a synthetic quaternary amine) is preferred as it is too large to cross the blood-brain barrier.  
\- Scopolamine and atropine (both tertiary amines) can easily cross the blood-brain barrier and could theoretically increase the incidence of emergence delirium.  
  
**Ketamine in the presence of pulmonary hypertension is controversial.  
**\- Currently, the administration of ketamine is not recommended for patients with pulmonary hypertension.  
\- Several authors reported an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) and/or pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) after the injection of ketamine in adults and children.  
\- However, in the presence of sevoflurane, ketamine did not increase PVR in spontaneously breathing children with severe pulmonary hypertension.  
\- Positive pressure ventilation increases intrathoracic pressure, which raises mPAP and PVR and decreases LV preload.  
  
**Musculoskeletal:  
**\- Upper airway skeletal muscle tone is well maintained  
\- Ketamine may produce hypertonus and purposeful skeletal muscle movements.\- The patient may often exhibit some degrees of hypertonus and purposeful skeletal muscle movements, which may occur independently of surgical stimulation.  
  
**Ketamine and neuro (ICP):  
**\- Ketamine is reported to be a potent cerebral vasodilator:  
\- It is capable of increasing cerebral blood flow by 60% in the presence of normocapnia.  
\- Ketamine causes sustained increases in ICP in nonventilated patients.  
\- However, in hyperventilated patients requiring a craniotomy for a brain tumor or cerebral aneurysm resection, 1 mg/kg IV of ketamine did not increase middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity, and ICP decreased modestly.  
  
**Ketamine and ocular effects:**  
\-Nystagmus, diplopia, and dilation have been reported in recreational contexts.  
\- Ocular effects (i.e., blurred vision) have been primarily associated with ( _S_ )-ketamine.  
  
**Through the indirect sympathomimetic activity, ketamine can produce:  
**\- Nystagmus  
\- Pupillary dilation  
\- Salivation  
\- Lacrimation  
\- Spontaneous limb movements with increased muscle tone through indirect sympathomimetic activity.  
**\- Note:** The sympathetic nerve supply produces predominantly thicker mucous saliva mainly by the sublingual and partly the submandibular glands.  
  
**Neurotoxicity of ketamine use in children:**  
\- Ketamine was found to induce neurodegeneration in the developing brain of rats in 1999.  
\- This has resulted in further research and discussions on the neurotoxicity of ketamine use in children.  
\- Further studies have indicated that high doses or repeated ketamine doses can induce cell death, especially apoptosis, in many in vivo and in vitro models from mice, rats, and monkeys.  
\- The verdict concerning pediatrics is not conclusive as of yet.  
  
**Neuro damage with recreational use:**  
One MRI study reported that recreational ketamine users (total time of ketamine use: 0.5–12 years) presented with cortical atrophy in the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes and that measurable atrophies were associated with the initiation of drug use occurring 2–4 years prior  
( Wang et al., 2013 ).  
  
Another study on recreational users (total time of ketamine use: 1–10.5 years) reported a loss of frontal cortical white matter microstructure integrity correlated with total lifetime ketamine use ( Liao et al., 2010 ).  
  
**Ketamine and EEG:**  
\- At high doses, ketamine produces a burst suppression.  
\- Ketamine-induced excitatory activity occurs in the thalamus and limbic systems without evidence of subsequent spread of seizure activity to cortical areas.  
\- It is unlikely for ketamine to precipitate generalized convulsions in patients with seizure disorders.  
\- Ketamine did not alter the seizure threshold in epileptic patients and is believed to have anticonvulsant properties by the lack of cortical epileptic activity in these patients.  
  
_**Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEP):**_  
\- Ketamine increases the cortical amplitude of somatosensory evoked potentials and is attenuated by nitrous oxide.  
\- Auditory and visual evoked responses are decreased by ketamine.  
  
**Ketamine inhibits platelet aggregation.  
**\- Ketamine possibly inhibits platelet aggregation by suppressing the formation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and subsequent inhibition of cytosolic free calcium concentrations.  
\- This should be considered prior to administering ketamine in patients with known bleeding disorders undergoing surgery.  
  
**Inflammation and irritation to the urinary bladder and urethra**  
Long-term ketamine use (abuse) can cause inflammation and irritation to the urinary bladder and urethra.  
Similar changes have recently been described in the biliary tract, resulting in an acute or chronic cholestatic liver injury that can resemble sclerosing cholangitis.  
  
**Drug interactions:  
Theophylline or Aminophylline:**  
Do not co-administer with ketamine as concomitant use because it may lower the seizure threshold.  
  
**Sympathomimetics and Vasopressin:**  
\- Closely monitor vital signs when co-administered with ketamine.  
\- Consider dose adjustment individualized to the patient’s clinical situation.  
  
**Benzodiazepines, Opioid Analgesics, or other CNS Depressants:**  
\- Concomitant use may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, or death.  
\- Concomitant use of opioid analgesics may prolong recovery time.  
**Pregnancy:**  
\- There are no adequate and well-controlled studies performed on pregnant women.  
\- Animal data show that ketamine may cause harm to the fetus; avoid use during pregnancy, labor, and delivery.  
\- Ketamine is still a popular go-to drug for failed neuraxial anesthesia during c-sections.  
  
**Lactation:**  
It is not known if ketamine is present in breast milk.  
Small supplemental doses of ketamine used during cesarean delivery should not prevent breastfeeding once the mother is stable and alert. However, data is insufficient to recommend its use for long-term pain control (ABM \[Martin 2018\]).  
  
**Ketamine and Neuraxial anesthesia:** Controversial  
Intrathecal and epidural injections may frequently result in psychodysleptic effects.Neuraxial ketamine is rare in clinical practice, but there is literature from studies on it being used.  
**Epidural:** Rare in clinical practice as the efficacy of ketamine via epidural is controversial.  
  
**Ketamine may decrease postoperative depression:  
**Studies have shown that small doses of ketamine improved the postoperative depressive state in patients with mental depression via NMDA receptors for glutamate.  
  
**Nasal transmucosal:  
\-** Sedation develops within 20-40 minutes.  
\- It is suggested to preservative-free ketamine for this route because the preservative is neurotoxic.  
\- In theory, nasally administered ketamine could cause neuro tissue damage if it reaches the cribriform plate.  
  
**Rectal:**  
\- Produces good anxiolysis and sedation within 30 minutes.  
\- However, the rectal route may provide reliable absorption.  
  
**First-pass metabolism with oral and rectal routes of administration.  
**Due to ketamine’s extensive first-pass metabolism, rectal and oral formulations have limited bioavailability with relatively high concentrations of the active (but less-potent) metabolite norketamine.  
However, these routes are still effective for causing sedation.  
  
**Possible adverse effects:  
**Emergence delirium  
Nightmares  
Hallucinations  
Prolonged recovery  
Increased ICP  
Allergic reaction  
**\- Cardiovascular:** Cardiac arrhythmia, decreased blood pressure, decreased heart rate, increased blood pressure, increased heart rate  
**\- Gastrointestinal:** Anorexia, nausea, vomiting  
**\- Dermatologic:** Erythema of skin, morbilliform rash, rash at the injection site  
**\- Ophthalmic:** Diplopia, increased intraocular pressure, nystagmus disorder  
**\- Respiratory:** Airway obstruction from thick tenacious secretions, salivation and coughing  
**\- Nervous system:** Hypertonia (tonic-clonic movements sometimes resembling seizures)  
  
**When to consider avoiding or limiting the dosage of ketamine:  
****Hemodynamic instability:**  
Monitor vital signs and cardiac function during ketamine administration.  
**  
Cardiovascular disease:**  
**Use with caution in patients with:**  
Coronary artery disease  
Catecholamine depletion  
Hypertension  
Tachycardia**Hypersensitive airways:  
\-** Increased tenacious secretion may cause bronchospasm or laryngospasm.  
\- Procedural sedation for major procedures involving the posterior pharynx (eg, endoscopy).  
\- Patients with a history of airway instability, tracheal surgery, or tracheal stenosis.  
\- Upper respiratory diseases.  
\- Presence of airway infection, especially peds.  
  
**Dependence:**  
May cause dependence (withdrawal symptoms on discontinuation) and tolerance with prolonged use.  
  
**Patients more prone to emergence delirium:  
**Ages 16 to 65  
Female gender  
High doses greater than 2 mg/kg IV  
History of personality problems or frequent dreaming.  
**Less common in patients:**  <16 years of age and > 65 years of age and when given IM.  
  
**Patients with increased ocular pressure** :  
\- Use with caution in patients with increased intraocular pressure (IOP).  
\- Consider avoiding in patients with an open eye injury or other ophthalmologic disorder where an increase in IOP would prove to be detrimental.  
**  
Patients with Porphyria:  
**\- The use of ketamine in patients with porphyria is a relative contraindication due to the enhanced sympathomimetic effect produced by ketamine. (ACEP \[Green 2011\]).  
**  
Thyroid disorders:  
**\- Patients with a thyroid disorder or receiving a thyroid medication a relative contraindication due to enhanced sympathomimetic effect produced by ketamine (ACEP \[Green 2011\]).  
  
**< 3 years of age and third trimester of pregnancy:  
**\- This is the time of rapid brain growth and synaptogenesis.  
\- The repeated or lengthy exposure to sedatives or anesthetics during surgery/procedures may have detrimental effects on the child's or fetus’ brain development and may contribute to various cognitive and behavioral problems.  
  
**Contraindications of ketamine:**  
\- In patients for whom a significant elevation of blood pressure would be a severe hazard.  
\- Known hypersensitivity to ketamine or any excipient.  
  
**Ketamine in infants < 3 months of age is an absolute contraindication.**  
\- The American College of Emergency Physicians considers the use of ketamine in infants <3 months of age to be an absolute contraindication, due to the higher risk of airway complications (ACEP \[Green 2011\]).  
  
**Allergic reactions to ketamine are very rare.  
**Ketamine does not evoke the release of histamine and rarely, if ever, causes allergic reactions.
