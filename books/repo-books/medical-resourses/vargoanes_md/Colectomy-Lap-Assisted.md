Laparoscopic Assisted Colectomy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Laparoscopic Assisted Colectomy

Removing part of the colon and nearby lymph nodes. Once the diseased part of the colon has been freed, one of the incisions is made larger to allow for its removal. You won’t have to hydrate the patient as much because it is not an open belly, thus less insensible water loss.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
Usually RSI if the abdomen is extended.  
**Nitrous Oxide:** No  
**Thoracic Epidural:** Sometimes but not as common anymore. It’s for post-op pain.  
**Duration:** 1-3 hours  
**IV Access:** 1 18G.  
**Typed and Screened**: Yes, but we usually don’t need blood.  
**EBL:** 50-100 mLs; depends on the surgeon.  
**OG Tube:** Yes, unless the surgeon wants an NG tube. NG tubes are becoming more rare.  
**Position:** Supine and steep Trendelenburg if it’s laparoscopic.  
**Bowel Prep:** Usually  
**Fluid Deficit:** 1-2 liters. These patients are usually dry from a bowel prep and being NPO.

  
**Possible Complications:**  
Port site hernia  
Ileus  
Bowel obstruction  
Abdominal abscess  
Anastomotic leak  
Wound infection
