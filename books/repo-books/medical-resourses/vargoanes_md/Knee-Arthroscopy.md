### Knee Arthroscopy (Knee Scope) without a Block

Basic knee scopes without ligament repairs usually do not need blocks.  

**Basic Arthroscopic Knee Procedures**  
(See details of these procedures following)  
Chondroplasty  
Synovectomy  
Excision of Plica.  
Medial Meniscectomy.  
Partial Medial Meniscectomy or PMM.  
Partial Lateral  Meniscectomy or PLM.  
Remove loose Bodies.  
Lateral Release.  
Lyses of Adhesions.

**Anesthetic:** General, LMA or ETT. Usually an LMA if there is no aspiration risk.  
**Duration:** 30-90 minutes  
**Position:** Supine with arms out, operative leg is placed in an arthroscopic leg holder.  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
  
**Possible Complications:**  
Hemarthrosis  
Numbness   
Infection   
Damage to structures, nerves, or blood vessels around and in the knee.  
DVT

The surgeon makes several small incisions, usually two or three, around the knee. Sterile saline is pumped into the knee through one incision to expand it and to wash blood from the area. This allows the surgeon to see the knee structures more clearly

Be aware of floor water (NS or LR) invading your floor area. Just cover the blankets over it.

**Common Procedures Done with a Knee Arthroscopy:**  
**Chondroplasty:** Debridement/shaving of articular cartilage. Cutting out damaged cartilage and reshaping or smoothing out the underlying healthy tissue, allowing healthy cartilage to grow in its place.

**Synovectomy:** To remove partial or all the synovial membrane of a joint. The synovium lines the joint.  
**Indication:** Treatment of inflammation and excessive growth of the synovium. 

   
**Lateral Release:** Realigning the kneecap. The kneecap moves up and down in a groove on the end of the femur as the knee bends. When the knee moves laterally (patellar tilt), the lateral retinaculum is too tight and pulls the patella out of alignment and causes pain. This is called patella femoral syndrome. The surgeon will cut through this tight retinaculum, and allow the kneecap to sit properly within its groove.

Patella Femoral Syndrome (PFPS) frequently occurs in teenagers, manual laborers, and athletes.

**Excision of Plica: A** Plica Syndrome or synovial plica syndrome is the result of a leftover fetal tissue (Plica) in the knee. Later in life it becomes irritated and swollen. Arthroscopically, the plica tissue is cut away and removed. The area where the plica is removed heals back with scar tissue.   
  
**Meniscectomy and Meniscus Repair:**  Is the surgical removal or repair of either of two C-shaped bands of cartilage in the knee joint. The meniscus forms a buffer between the leg bones (the tibia, fibula, and femur); it serves as a shock absorber; it assists in lubrication of the joint; and it also limits the joint's flexion, extension, and rotation.

**Remove Loose Bodies:** Free floating pieces of debris in the joint. They are tissues that have torn away from their original location and move around inside the joint, causing pain, swelling and locking. They are removed.
