GP (Glycoprotein) IIb/IIIa Inhibitors–Antiplatelets    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### GP (Glycoprotein) IIb/IIIa Inhibitors–Antiplatelets

A class of platelet inhibitors which function by binding to and blocking GPIIb/IIIa receptors to fibrinogen on the platelet surface.  
  
**Indications**  
Treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) managed medically or with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) including intracoronary stenting.  
  
**3 most commom GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors**  
Abciximab (ReoPro)  
Eptifibatide (Integrilin)  
Tirofiban (Aggrastat)  
  
**GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors**  
Blocks platelet aggregation  
  
Does NOT inhibit platelet activation  
  
**Mechanism of action:** Attaches to and blocks the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors on the platelets. This prevents platelet aggregation, thrombus formation, and distal thromboembolism while preserving initial platelet binding to damaged vascular surfaces.  
  
**What are the GPIIb/IIIa receptors?**  
These are the major platelet surface receptors for the binding of fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor.  
  
The GPIIb/IIIa is a receptor on the platelet surface that undergoes a conformational change upon activation of the platelet allowing it to bind plasma fibrinogen. Because multiple GPIIb/IIIa molecules from different platelets can bind the same fibrinogen molecule, this facilitates platelet aggregation at sites of vascular injury.  
  
By preventing the GPIIb/IIIa molecule from interacting with fibrinogen, these drugs inhibit the process of platelet aggregation. GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors are structurally divergent with the prototype, Abciximab, being a monoclonal Fab Fragment whereas Eptifibatide and Tirofiban are small peptides.

**Optional Laboratory Tests** (Platelet function should to be evaluated)  
VerifyNow IIb/IIIa test (platelet function assay)  
Multiplate (platelet function assay)  
PRP - Aggregation (platelet function test)  
PFA - 100/200 (platelet function assay)  
Whole blood aggregation (Platelet function assay)  
Plateletworks Assay (platelet function assay)  
  
During percutaneous coronary intervention the ACT should be maintained between 200 and 300 seconds.  
  
**Antidote:** None  
**Reversal:** Platelets  
  
**Platelet GP IIb/IIIa Receptors**  
Each platelet has multiple binding sites for fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor which results in the binding and cross-linking of multiple platelets, known as aggregation. Their binding sites are Platelet GP IIb/IIIa.  
  
Both eptifibatide and tirofiban exhibit a longer half-life compared with abciximab.  
  
The half-life of eptifibatide is 2.5 hours and that of tirofiban is 2 hours.  
  
Of the three agents available for clinical use, the affinity of abciximab is greatest.  
Despite the half-life of Platelet GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors being only a few hours, it is recommended that patients be off them for 30 days prior to a NON-urgent surgery.  
  
**Reversal Agents for Glyocoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors**  
There are no reversal agents currently indicated for glyocoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors.  
Platelet transfusions may be offered in adjunct to supportive management.  
Tirofibran is dialyzable and therefore hemodialysis may also be considered.
