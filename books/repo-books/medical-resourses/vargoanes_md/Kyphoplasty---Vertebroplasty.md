### Kyphoplasty and Vertebroplasty

These procedures both treat fractured vertebrae, usually from osteoporosis. They both inject cement into vertebrae that have experienced a compression fracture. Both aim to stop pain and to stabilize the spine.

**For Kyphoplasty:** A balloon is inserted into the vertebral body and gently inflated to restore shape and height to the fractured bone. The balloon is then removed and the bone cement is injected. This will hold the restored height and shape in place.

**For Vertebroplasty:** The bone cement is also injected into the broken areas of bone to stabilize the spine, but a balloon is NOT used and no attempt is made to restore the former height of the bone.

**Indication:** To stop the pain caused by a spinal fracture (usually from osteoporosis), and to stabilize the bone.

**Pre-op:** If it’s a MAC case, you should closely assess the patient’s airway and check for a history of OSA, because the patient will be in the prone position.

**Anesthetic:** MAC or General  
**Ketamine:** Is commonly administered when this as a MAC case. These are painful procedures.

**Duration:** Around 30 minutes, sometimes less.

**Position:** Prone.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable. Avoid an AC site due to flexed arms when the patient is lying prone with arms flexed in the flying superman position.  
The C-arm is used by the surgeon to view and verify the correct space to insert the needle into the fractured vertebrae. Some neurosurgeons may use a microscope.   
**Antibiotics:** Usually Ancef, unless contraindicated.  
  
**For a MAC case:** Make sure the surgeon administers a sufficient amount of local anesthetic, especially onto the periosteum, where much nociception occurs. Some patients experience discomfort with advancement of the trochars across the posterior cortical margin, with balloon inflation in the case of kyphoplasty, and with a PMMA \[_Polymethylmethacrylate\]_ injection.

**Possible Complications:**  
Loss of airway: MAC in the prone position!  
Cement leakages.  
New vertebral fractures.  
PE  
Radiculopathy
