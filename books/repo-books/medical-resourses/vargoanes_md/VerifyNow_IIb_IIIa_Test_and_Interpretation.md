### VerifyNow IIb/IIIa Test and Interpretation

This test measures GP IIb/IIIa receptor blockade in patients treated with abciximab or eptifibatide. Tirofiban is also detected but does not presently have normal range or cut off values.  
  
**Review:** GP IIb/IIIa antagonists (abciximab, eptifibatide, tirofiban) bind to the IIb/IIIa platelet receptor which is then unable to bind fibrinogen for platelet aggregation.  
  
**Thrombin Receptor Agonist Peptide** **(TRAP) Agonist  
**The Verifynow “IIb/IIIa cartridge” contains iso-TRAP as the agonist, which activates fibrinogen binding by any unblocked IIb/IIIa platelet receptors.**  
  
Results are in Platelet Aggregation Units (PAU)Reference range: 0-330 PAU  
  
References Ranges of the GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors abciximab and eptifibatide**  
  
_A percent inhibition for a given patient can also be determined if a baseline PAU value was obtained prior to administration of the GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor.

| 136 - 288 PAU | Baseline prior to drug administration |
| --- | --- |
| 10 - 31 PAU | \> 80% platelet inhibition |
| 0 - 13 PAU | \> 95% platelet inhibition |

**Abciximab blood specimen:** collect in citrated tubes  
**Eptifibatide blood specimen:** collect in heparinized tubes  
  
The GP IIb/IIIa assay does not have an incubation time like aspirin, it can be run immediately.  
Each GP IIb/IIIa assay takes 2 minutes to run.  
  
Aspirin and/or heparin do not affect the results of the VerifyNow GP IIb/IIIa assay.  
  
**Result variability - may interfere with accuracy  
**Low hematocrit  
Low fibrinogen  
Thrombocytopenia
