### HIFU (High intensity focused ultrasound) of the Prostate

  
_Edited by Debra Barber, CRNA, DNP_

HIFU is a new treatment for certain patients with Prostate CA.

When high frequency sound waves are concentrated on body tissues, those tissues heat up and die. This principle is now utilized to treat (low grade) prostate CA. Because of the location of the prostate gland within the pelvis, the surgeon enters the rectum with a single transrectal probe (diameter of index finger) to directly guide ultrasound beams at the prostate gland.

The prostate has to be less than 40 grams. The duration of the procedure depends on the size of the prostate gland. It usually takes one hour per 10 grams of tissue.

**Anesthesia Summary**  
A basic prostate procedure with the patient in lithotomy position and you need to keep the patient motionless. ETT with muscle relaxation (most polpular) or a spinal are your options. Watch the patient's temperature because hypothermia may occur from the coolant used (cold fluid).

**Indications of the procedure:  
**Low grade prostate CA( just prostrate ca, not just low grade)  
Recurrent prostate cancer after radiotherapy (known as salvage HIFU).

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT, sometimes a spinal.

**Regional:** Be careful using a SAB, because the length of these cases vary. It can be 3-5 hours long. Any movement can cause sound waves to hit the wrong target. Some surgeons demand a general anesthetic with muscle relaxation.

**Nitrous**: Contraindicated-can get microbubble generation-these absorb HIFU energy and may block the path of sound waves.

**Muscle Relaxation:** needed if excessive respiratory/abdominal movements

**Position**: Lithotomy

**Duration:** one hour per 10 grams of prostate

**EBL:** Minimal

**IV Access:** 20g is acceptable

**A-line:** Not needed

**Age Range:** Adults males

**Foley Catheter:** Always; either urethral or supra public (if urethral area involved)

**Hydration:** LR or NS-the patient can be dry from a bowel prep.

**Emergence:** Emerge AFTER the surgeon is finished

**Possible Complications:**  
Infections in the prostate area  
Incontinence<1%  
Impotence 20%  
Urethral stricture

**Bladder neck contracture**  
Developing a fistula, between the urinary system and the bowel.

**More Notes  
**HIFU has a track record of 40,000 patients during a 15-year period and that it has never been suspended or taken off the market.  
But the FDA officials maintained that the benefit of HIFU is unclear and that the risk is substantial.  
Is FDA approved
