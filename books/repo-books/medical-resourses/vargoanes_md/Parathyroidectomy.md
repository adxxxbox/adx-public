Parathyroidectomy       body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Parathyroidectomy  

Pretty much like a Thyroidectomy case, except someone will have to draw a bunch of PTH levels during the case. If the PTH blood level sampling draws are our responsibility, make sure the circulator RN supplies you with the appropriate lab tubes and extra patient stickers.

A parathroidectomy is the surgical removal of one or more parathyroid glands.  
Rarely, when all four of these glands need to be removed, part of one may be transplanted into the forearm. Accidental removal of 3 of 4 may induce a transient hypoparathyroidism.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
Ask the surgeon if he wants the patient relaxed.  
We historically have NEVER paralyzed these patients. The surgeon would utilize the muscle twitching to help identify and avoid the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Today more surgeons appear to do fine identifying the nerve with the patient relaxed.  
**NIMs EMG ETT:** Check with the circulator if you need to use a NIM endotracheal tube. They are not used as much anymore. Some of the older surgeons still use them. If the surgeon wants to use the NIMS ETT, then you know he will NOT want the patient relaxed.  
**LTA kit:** Optional. Despite some literature, the NIMs ETT works fine after an LTA kit is used.  
**Muscle Relaxants:** Anectine or a low dose of Rocuronium for induction and intubation. The low dose of Rocuronium will have worn off by the time the surgeon needs to visualize the muscle twitching.

**Duration:** 1-3 hours. Depends on the surgeon.  
**Position:** Supine, arms tucked, shoulder roll placed after intubation. The head is placed on a foam donut instead of a pillow with the patient’s head slightly extended back.  
**Neo Drip:** Yes, make sure you connect it before the arm is tucked. Make sure also that the drip flows after the arm is tucked. If you are not relaxing the patient, you will have to run the inhalation agent higher and we know this causes hypotension.  
**Toradol vs. Ofirmev:** Ofirmev is your choice of analgesic. Some surgeons tend to blame any hematomas on the Toradol.  
**Antiemetics:** Yes.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable. Make sure it runs well after the arm is tucked.  
**A-Line**: Depends: If it is anesthesia’s responsibility to draw the multiple PTH levels, then yes. So find this out ahead of time. Most of the time it is anesthesia’s responsibility to draw the PTHs. An A-line makes it easier.  
Some surgeons just draw the PTH levels from the IJ within the surgical site. In that situation, an A-line is not needed.  
I have even seen a case where the patient had an extra large AC IV Heplock and the nurse would draw the PTHs from that catheter. Hard to do with the arms tucked, though.  
**EBL**: Minimal.

**PTH Levels:**  
So as mentioned above, if it is your responsibility to draw these serial samples, you will need an A-line.  
Draw a baseline PTH level before incision.

Draw the rest when the surgeon tells you to. Usually that will occur at 10-minute intervals later on in the case.  
PTH levels will drop within 10 minutes after removing the glands. That is what you are looking for: a high PTH to begin with and a gradual decline with each successive sample.

Try to pre-label the lab test tubes and write all the information you need on them b**e**cause if you forget to write the date or time etc., the lab will make you redraw them.   
**Pathology:** The surgeon usually sends some frozen sections to confirm the removal of parathyroid tissue.

**Emergence:** Do not wake the patient up until the PTH results are back and the surgeon is  satisfied. If there is not a drastic reduction in the PTH levels, than the surgeon obviously did not remove the correct tissue. If not contraindicated, extubate deep and avoid bucking.

**Adverse Effects:**  
A big surgical complication is the dreaded hematoma formation under the incision. A rapidly enlarging hematoma can obstruct the airway.  
There is a 1:300 risk of bleeding. This is the main reason why the patient stays overnight in the hospital.
