### Postdural Puncture Headache (PDPH) - Conservative Treatments

**Supine position** \- theoretically this decreases hydrostatic pressure and reduces the amount of CSF leaking from the dural puncture. However, there is no evidence that bed rest will reduce the duration of headache. Early ambulation should be encouraged, if tolerated, to reduce complications. Bed rest should be encouraged for patients who do not tolerate an upright position. A supine position reduces the intensity of the headache.  
  
**Hydration -** theoretically encourages the production of CSF. Dehydration may contribute to the severity of symptoms that the patient experiences. Patients should be hydrated intravenously and/or encouraged to take fluids by mouth. Studies however do not show a decrease in the duration of postdural puncture headache.  
  
**Caffeine** \- theoretically helps decrease signs and symptoms of a headache by vasoconstriction of the cerebral vessels. Once again, this may help decrease the symptoms but does not reduce the number of patients that will require an epidural blood patch. Intravenous caffeine may be administered in a dose of 500 mg. In practice, oral caffeine intake is encouraged. An oral dose of 300 mg has been shown to decrease the intensity of postdural puncture headache.  
  
Analgesic medication administration may decrease the severity of the signs and symptoms. Medications include acetaminophen or NSAIDs such as ibuprofen.  Stool softeners and a soft diet will help decrease Valsalva straining and leakage of CSF.  
  
**Transnasal sphenopalatine ganglion blocks (SPGB)** are now being utilized by some anesthesia providers to alleviate the headache.
