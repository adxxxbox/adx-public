**Short summary of the surgical procedure:**  
After induction of GETA and positioning in the supine position, the surgeon will make a midline surgical incision. If the procedure is done for either imperforate anus or cloaca, the procedure will start in prone position. Colostomy will obviously be done last. If resection is undertaken or if blind colonic stump is necessary, it will be done first.  
  

**Short summary describing the anesthesia:**  
General anesthesia is required.  
If IV present, an IV induction is preferred, especially if the case is done for a bowel obstruction.  
If there is no IV, then do inhalation induction and turn nitrous off immediately prior to intubation. This allows for both higher oxygen reserves and will begin to wash out nitrous in the bowel.  
Imperative to empty stomach after intubation.  
OG tube taped off to side is usually very well tolerated by infants and children.  
This is a relatively low EBL case. Of main concern will be impeccable fluid replacement. No major hemodynamic changes are expected.

**Indications of the procedure:  
**1\. Cloaca (ambiguous external openings of anus, urethra, and vagina if female)

2\. Imperforate Anus- rectum is present but there is no opening in the perineum

3\. Hirschsprung’s Disease- greatly dilated loops of colon due to lack of autonomic ganglia in the colon

4\. Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC)-premies or ex-premies have this due to delayed maturation of the colon and its fragile blood supply. \*these babies will be the SICK ones!

5 Bowel obstruction of various reasons (colitis, adhesions from previous surgeries-

not necessarily related to bowel-examples are bladder and ureteral surgery,  
renal surgery, spleen surgery-all may be found in children of all ages, cancer  
diagnoses in the peritoneum)

**Pre-op and what to prepare. What you need to find out?**  
Imperforate anus and to some extent cloaca will have a tendency to have other congenital defects.  
Urogenital defects are the most commonly seen defects followed by spine, extremity, and cardiac defects.  
The defect seen most is Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)!! If the colostomy is not done emergently then you have a little bit of time. Minimum info needed would include presence or absence of “tet spells,” what precipitates a “spell”? Is the child on cardiac drugs, such a digoxin? Is Pulmonary Hypertension (PHTN) present? You may consider having nitroglycerin, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), and phenylephrine drips available to manipulate SVR and PVR. If PHTN is present, also consider running mildly hypocapneic and higher FiO2. Aside from cardiac problems, has the child had any episodes of persistent UTIs and/or pyelonephritis resulting from urogenital disorders? Babies in particular may have difficulty with salt loads so LR with a D5% piggyback.

**Anesthetic_:_** GETA with sevoflurane or isoforane. Both of these tend to be the most cardiac stable choices. Narcotic to include total of 1.5 to 2 mcg/kg. If caudal anesthesia is used, this dose can be cut by a third.  
**Airway issues:** Probably straight-forward. Age appropriate endotracheal tube, cuff vs. uncuffed.  
**Regional-Caudal** _:_ Caudal anesthesia is a perfect analgesic choice for either an infant or young child. It is very easy to do in the younger population. Most frequently used local is 0.5% Bupivacaine. For maximal analgesic effect place at the completion of the procedure, as it will confer 4-5 hours of analgesia before med starts to retract.

**Induction:** IV preferred, especially if emergency with abdominal distension. Inhaled induction ok, just turn nitrous oxide off prior to intubation and ventilate with 100% oxygen  
**Nitrous** _:_ only for induction. Otherwise a NO NO!!!  
**Muscle Relaxation** : Absolutely. Vecuronium is exceedingly forgiving and can be reversed fairly easily. Maintain 1 twitch unless surgeon complains.  
**Position:** May start prone if this is done for cloaca or imperforate anus, with a bump under the pelvis. If using this position for a while a neonate or infant will tend to have more head and neck swelling. Once patient goes back to supine it should subside. You can actually do a modified reverse Trendelenburg position by using towel rolls under head and shoulders. Assess for edema with cuff leak prior to extubation.  
**Duration** _:_ 1-2 hours if for straightforward case, 4-5 hours for complex resection or perineal reconstruction.  
**EBL:** minimal  
**IV Access** _:_ I personally prefer two IVs if at all possible, especially if it will be a long case. One can be a saline lock with an extension on it so you can hook it up easily if necessary. Alternatively place the second IV after rehydration is already underway. But trying to get a second IV in a hurry on baby is never fun!!!

**Hydration: 4:2:1** (below is just a common reference)  
(Not an open belly case)  
Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin - more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc/kg)  
  
**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic)  0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation)  2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases)  4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC)  >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss with an open belly case.  
  
**EBV (reference)**  
**Premature:** 90-100cc/kg  
**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg  
**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg  
**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**A-line:** not necessary unless profound cardiac defects.  
**Age Range:** All age ranges can be represented because there are a number of indications and/or disease processes for colostomy  
**Foley Catheter:** If straightforward quick and simple lysis of adhesions, quick resection of dead bowel with colostomy, then NO. However if it will be a lengthy case with turning from prone to supine then YES. Maintain 0.5 cc/kg/hr

**Emergence:** Muscle relaxant needs to be fully reversed. If patient is an infant he should be able to flex at hips/thighs. Assess head and neck edema if any time spent prone or if a lot of IV fluids were administered. Check for leak around ETT and assess for adequate or excess of narcotic based on respiratory rate and effort and ETCO2 levels. All should be WNL prior to extubation.  
  
**Possible Complications:** _Main complications would be_  
1\. Risk of aspiration if full stomach  
2\. Airway swelling and facial edema if patient is prone for any length of time  
3\. Transient hypotension/oliguria if IV status is not critically in check  
4\. If cardiac defects are present, patient could exhibit TET spell(s), which is when you would consider use of vasoactive drips.  
5\. Excessive fluid administration - check CXR, feel fontanel if sutures are still open.

**More Notes:  
How I warm Albumin  
**Helpful hints for warming/administering Albumin. I like to get a non-sterile plastic container, fill it with sterile water from the warmer, and plop my bottle of albumin into it. I will use one liquid crystal skin temp probe on the container, and then stick one to the bottle of albumin before I draw it up. Then replace hot water as needed. I also put two stopcocks inline so I can remove the base solution as I am giving an albumin bolus (this is like retrograde tubing from PICU days). It allows for discrete and accurate fluid calculations.
