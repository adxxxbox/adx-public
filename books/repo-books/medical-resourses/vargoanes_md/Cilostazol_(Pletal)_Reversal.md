### Cilostazol (Pletal) Reversal

_Currently, there is a lack of specific antidotes for the growing number of new (novel) anticoagulants that are slowly replacing warfarin and heparin. For this reason, there is NO universal standard of care for the treatment of the anticoagulated bleeding patient when there is no specific antidote._

**Consult cardiology for ALL patients with coronary stents.**  
  
**Quick Notes**  
Cilostazol reversibly inhibits platelet aggregation-meaning NOT the life-span of the platelets.  
  
The platelet aggregation returns to normal within 96 hours of stopping Cilostazol.  
  
**Dialyzable:** NO, Cilostazol is highly protein-bound, it is unlikely that it can be efficiently removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.  
  
**Specific Antidote:** None  
  
**Initial Response:**  
Discontinue infusion and hold future doses of Cilostazol  
Find out when the last dose of Cilostazol was taken.  
**Consider lab tests:** Platelet Function Assay, CBC, BMP, liver function tests and DIC.  
  
**Lab Monitoring:**  
Studies show when administered alone on healthy patients, there is little to no change in Bleeding Time, aPTT, PT and INR.  
Platelet Function Assay should be reliable.  
**  
Minor Bleed:  
**Apply mechanical compression  
Assess labs above.  
**Pharmacological Options for mild bleed  
Tranexamic acid (TXA):** Loading dose: 1 gram over 10min followed by maintenance dose of 1 gram over next 8 hours (125 mg/hr). Contraindicated with stents or recent MI.  
Platelets transfusion if needed.  
  
**Severe Bleed  
Hematology consult.  
**Administer more platelets  
Initiate massive transfusion protocols.  
FEIBA 8 to 25 units/kg or Kcentra can be considered.
