### Pheochromocytoma (PCC)

**Pheochromocytoma (PCC)** is a rare neuroendocrine disorder caused by neoplasms consisting of chromaffin tissue that synthesize hypertension inducing catecholamines.  
Most pheochromocytomas secrete both epinephrine and norepinephrine.  
90 percent of the neoplasms occur within the medulla of one of the adrenal glands.  
10 percent occur outside of the area and are referred to as extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas or paragangliomas.  
  
**Paragangliomas** are indistinguishable from pheochromocytomas at the cellular level.  
They can secrete catecholamines and present clinically like pheochromocytomas.  
  
**Paragangliomas may be found in the:  
**Celiac  
Mesenteric  
Renal  
Hypogastric  
Testicular  
Paravertebral sympathetic nerve plexus  
Chest  
Heart  
Bladder  
Neck or base of the skull  
  
Pheochromocytoma cells may also release other peptides, some of which cause symptoms that cannot be controlled by adrenergic blockade only.  
**Such secretory products include:  
**Substance P  
Neuropeptide Y  
Enkephalins  
Somatostatin-corticotropin-releasing hormone  
Adrenocorticotropin hormone  
Atrial natriuretic peptide  
Vasointestinal peptide  
Parathormone  
Interleukin-1  
Iinterleukin-6  
Calcitonin gene-related peptide  
Chromogranin A  
  
**_Why the concern of pheochromocytoma?  
_**_A sudden increase in sympathetic activity may cause severe hypertension and may cause life-threatening pulmonary edema, dysrhythmias, hemorrhage, heart failure and myocardial infarction.  
  
Mortality is usually caused by a malignant hypertensive crisis with cerebrovascular accidents or dissecting aortic aneurysm, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, heart failure, acute renal failure, or irreversible shock leading to multiple organ dysfunction._  
**Characteristics of Pheochromocytoma**  
**Classic triad:** Most patients with do not present with all three.  
**Hypertension:** One-half have paroxysmal hypertension.  
Hypertension is sustained in 50%, paroxysmal in 30%, and blood pressure is normal in 20% of patients.  
**Headache:** Mild or severe, occurs in up to 90 percent of symptomatic patients.  
**Sweating:** 60 to 70 percent of symptomatic patients  
**  
Other symptoms:**  
Tachycardia, tremor, pallor and flushing, orthostatic hypotension, fever, blurred vision, papilledema, weight loss, hyperglycemia, polyuria, polydipsia, and constipation.  
  
**If left untreated, pheochromocytomas may progress to:  
**Volume depletion  
Organ or limb ischemia,  
Acute or chronic cardiomyopathy  
Myocarditis  
Cerebral hemorrhaging  
Pulmonary edema  
CHF  
Stroke  
MI  
Death  
  
**Prevalence:** 1:5,000 with hypertension have pheochromocytoma.  
10 to 15 percent of pheochromocytomas may metastasize to the lymph nodes, liver, lungs, and bones.  
50 percent of the cases are diagnosed only at post-mortem examination.  
A proportion of patients are diagnosed at the time of induction of anesthesia and may precipitate a hypertensive crisis. In this situation mortality is close to 80%  
  
**Male vs female:** Equal  
**Age:** Most often occur between 30 and 50 years of age.  
10 percent of cases occur in children.  
10 percent of pheochromocytomas are bilateral and 10% are cancerous.  
95 percent of adrenaline-secreting tumors are located within the abdomen, and of these, 85 to 90 percent are in the adrenal glands.  
25 to 35 percent of cases may be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.  
  
**Familial pheochromocytoma**  
Up to 40 percent of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are associated with hereditary syndromes. Patients with familial pheochromocytomas (eg, MEN2, VHL) have a high incidence of bilateral disease.  
**  
Differential diagnosis:**  
Thyrotoxicosis  
Hypoglycemia  
Anxiety or panic attacks  
Hyperthyroidism  
Adrenal medullary hyperplasia  
Familial dysautonomia  
**Tumors:** Neuroblastomas, ganglioneuroblastomas, and ganglioneuromas may also mimic pheochromocytomas.  
Withdrawal of the medications- clonidine or narcotics may cause similar symptoms.  
  
Some people who develop pheochromocytomas have a rare inherited condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia that makes them prone to tumors in the thyroid, parathyroid, and adrenal glands.  
  
**Pheochromocytomas and coexisting diseases**  
Pheochromocytomas may also develop in people who have von Hippel–Lindau disease and in those who have neurofibromatosis (von Recklinghausen disease) or a number of other genetic diseases.  
It is likely that nearly 50% of people who have pheocromocytomas have a genetic or familial disease such as these.  
  
Some inherited cases may occur as part of a larger disorder such as multiple endocrine neoplasia types 2a and 2b, von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, neurofibromatosis or familial paraganglioma syndromes types 1, 3 or 4, or as familial isolated pheochromocytoma.  
  
**Diagnosis  
**24 hour urine fractionated metanephrines and catecholamine or  
Plasma fractionated metanephrines drawn from indwelling cannula following 30 minutes in the supine position.  
Lab tests confirms catecholamine hypersecretion, followed by identifying the tumor with imaging studies.  
Abdominal CT for adrenal mass.  
  
**MRI:** Preferred over CT scanning in children and pregnant or lactating women; has reported sensitivity of up to 100% in detecting adrenal pheochromocytomas.  
  
**PET scanning:** A promising technique for detection and localization of pheochromocytomas.  
  
**Treatment for pheochromocytoma  
**Surgical resection of the pheochromocytoma tumor usually cures the hypertension.  
90 percent of pheochromocytomas are successfully surgically removed.  
Adrenalectomy of one or both of the adrenal glands or another location in case of extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas, may be performed.  
A small amount of the adrenal medulla can be left behind to preserve normal glucocorticoid production of the adrenal. This may reduce later complications caused by glucocorticoid deficiency in patients that need removal of both adrenals.  
  
**Radiation therapy for malignant pheochromocytoma:** Radiation is used to target and destroy cancer cells, and certain combinations of anticancer drugs (chemotherapy) may also be used.  
  
_The patient will be placed on medications in attempt to stabilize or limit catecholamine  
secretions prior to surgery.  
_**  
Medications:  
**Combined alpha and beta- blockade (always alpha blockade before beta blockade).  
Calcium channel blockers  
Metyrosine  
  
**Why alpha blockade before beta blockade  
**The beta-blocker should **NEVER** be started before the alpha-blocker.  
Unopposed alpha 1 receptor stimulation will cause more vasoconstriction, further worsening the hypertension against a beta blocked heart. This can lead to immediate cardiogenic shock.  
Selective alpha-1-adrenergic blocking agents are usually administered 10 to 14 days preoperatively to normalize blood pressure and expand the contracted blood volume.  
**  
Short acting selective alpha-1-adrenergic blocking agents:  
**Prazosin (Minipress, Prazin, Prazo): 2-5 mg BID or TID  
Terazosin (Hytrin): 2-5 mg daily  
Doxazosin (Cardura)-very popular: 2-8 mg daily for doxazosin, which can be increased to 32 mg/day.  
  
**Long acting** **non-selective, irreversible alpha blocker**  
Phenoxybenzamine (Dibenzyline) .  
  
Phenoxybenzamine was used for pretreatment before 2003 and doxazosin from 2003 onwards.  
Doxazosin replaced prazosin and bisoprolol (beta-blocker) for 3 days before surgery and was maintained throughout anesthesia.  
  
**When Phenoxybenzamine is preferred**  
**Phenoxybenzamine** (a longer acting alpha-blocker) may be administered in patients with recent myocardial infarction, catecholamine cardiomyopathy, refractory hypertension, and catecholamine-induced vasculitis.  
**Beta-adrenergic blockade:** AFTER adequate alpha-adrenergic blockade has been achieved, beta-adrenergic blockade is initiated which typically occurs 2 to 3 days preoperatively.  
The clinician should exercise caution if the patient is asthmatic or has congestive heart failure.  
  
**Example:** Chronic catecholamine excess can produce a cardiomyopathy that may become evident with the initiation of beta-adrenergic blockade, resulting in acute pulmonary edema. Therefore, when the beta-adrenergic blocker is administered, it should be used cautiously and at a low dose.  
  
**Beta blockers:  
**Atenolol (Tenormin)  
Metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol-XL)  
Propranolol (Inderal, Innopran XL)  
Labetalol (Trandate)  
  
**Dihydropyridine Calcium channel blockers:**  
Useful as adjuncts largely because they are relatively easier to titrate and less likely to cause orthostatic hypotension.  
Functioning through the inhibition of catecholamine-mediated calcium influx in vascular smooth muscle, they do not cause reflex tachycardia, lessen the severity of catecholamine-induced vasospasm, and, therefore, are particularly useful in the subset of patients with catecholamine-induced myocarditis/vasospasm.  
  
**Nicardipine:** 30mg PO BID daily can also be administered to control blood pressure preoperatively and is given as an intravenous infusion intraoperatively.  
  
**Metyrosine (Demser):** Inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase and reduces catecholamine biosynthesis by 35-80%, as measured by urinary catecholamine levels.  
Indicated in patients with pheochromocytoma who are awaiting surgery, for long-term management of patients with malignant pheochromocytoma, or in cases of pheochromocytoma in which surgery is contraindicated.  
It can be useful in patients whose condition is refractory to phenoxybenzamine therapy, or it can be administered as an adjunct to that therapy.  
  
**Metyrosine (Demser)** A procedure protocol at the Mayo Clinic  
Start with metyrosine 250 mg every six hours on day 1,  
500 mg every six hours on day 2,  
750 mg every six hours on day 3  
1000 mg every six hours on the day before the procedure, with the last dose (1000 mg) the morning of the procedure.  
With this short-course metyrosine therapy, the main side effect is hypersomnolence.  
The extrapyramidal effects of phenothiazines or haloperidol may be potentiated, and their use concomitantly with metyrosine should be avoided.  
  
**High sodium diet:** Usually started on the second or third day of alpha-adrenergic blockade, (5000 mg daily) because of the catecholamine-induced volume contraction and the orthostasis associated with alpha-adrenergic blockade. This degree of volume expansion may be contraindicated in patients with congestive heart failure or renal insufficiency.  
  
**Blood pressure monitoring:** Patients monitor BP BID while seated and standing.  
Target blood pressure is less than 120/80 mmHg (seated), with systolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg (standing); both targets should be modified on the basis of the patient's age and comorbid disease.
