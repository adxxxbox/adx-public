### Mediastinitis and CABG

Mediastinitis is a wound infection after median sternotomy from cardiac or thoracic surgery.  
This complication affects approximately 1-2% of these patients.  
  
**Contributing Factors:**  
Obesity (in some studies).  
Length of surgery (or duration of cardiopulmonary bypass)  
Smoking.  
Poor hemostasis at the time of closure.  
Diabetes mellitus (in some studies).  
Poor perfusion.  
  
The development of Triclosan-coated sutures failed to decrease the infection rate.  
  
Deep sternal infection rates decreased from 2.1% to 1.5% and leg infection rates, from 1.93% to 0.47% after the implementations done below:  
  
**Interventions that have decreased the infection rate:**  
Chlorhexidine preoperative shower.  
Discontinuation of shaving.  
Administration of antibiotics in the holding area.  
Segregation of instruments.  
Implementation of an insulin protocol.  
  
**Associations:**  
Coagulase negative staphylococci: obesity, COPD and sternal dehiscence.  
Staph aureus: perioperative contamination of the mediastinal space.  
  
**Gram negative rods:** Postoperative spread of concomitant infections in other sites.  
  
The average time from operation to the development of mediastinitis is around 7 days.  
Sternal dehiscence was seen in 65-70%.  
  
Carries very high hospital mortality.  
Associated with reduced long-term survival.  
Involves an additional operation.  
Prolongs hospitalization.  
  
The main treatment is the use of a “Vac-Pack” or surgical debridement with primary or delayed reconstruction with vascularized soft tissue (pectoral muscle or omentum).
