# Alfenta

**Alfenta (Alfentanil)**  
**Class:** Opioid agonist  
An analogue of Fentanyl but 1/5-1/10th weaker.  
Alfenta has been slowly replacing Propofol as the drug of choice just prior to a Retrobulbar Block.  
1/3rd the duration of fentanyl.  
  
**Clinical use:** for anything-requiring rapid onset and offset potent analgesic, however, Alfenta is 19 times LESS potent than Remifentanil. So Alfenta induces LESS apnea at lower doses.  
  
**Onset:** 1-2 minutes  
Onset of Remifentanil is 1.1 minutes and Alfentanil is 1.4 minutes.  
  
**Peak:** 3-5 minutes (literature varies)  
  
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes (literature varies)  
  
**Induction Dose:** 15mcg/kg (before direct laryngoscopy and Retrobulbar Blocks).  
  
**Intubation Dose:** 30mcg/kg bolus blocks catecholamine response.  
  
150-300mcg/kg bolus produces unconsciousness in about 45 seconds, followed by 25-150mcg/kg/hr drip with an inhalation agent.  
  
**Metabolized by 2 Pathways:**  
Piperidine N-dealkylation and Amide N-dealkylation Cleared by the liver.  
Not recommended for Kids < 12  
Adverse Effects: Hypotension, bradycardia and arrhythnmias  
  
**More Notes:**  
**Retrobulbar Block:** Place a NC on the patient and monitor ETCO2.  
Pre-oxygentate the patient.  
Some CRNAs prefer to hold the versed until block is completed.  
Have the patient take several deep breaths to build a reserve incase they go apneic. The patient does not lose consciousness, just yell their name and they will breathe and respond.  
If the patient has a slow resting HR, consider 0.2mg Robinul to prevent bradycardia (HR drops 5-15 bpm on average) with a decrease in RR after giving Alfenta.  
About 1-2 minutes after you push the Alfenta, ask the patient if they feel warm and numb all over while you wait for a small change in HR and RR. Thats when you inform the doc to give the block. You can also observe the ETCO2 RR. When their RR decreases, you know they are ready. Seems strange compared to Propofol because the patient is still awake and follows commands.  
Use common sense. If its a geriatric patient, consider a 100-250mcg bolus.  
Healthy patient depending on their weight, 500mcg bolus, sometimes followed by 250-500mcg if they did not seem phased by the first dose.  
Every eye doc I know prefers Alfenta over Propofol.  
Cirrhosis, but not cholestatic disease will prolong elimination half time.  
Renal failure has no effect.  
Principally bound to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein whose plasma level is not altered by liver disease.  
  
**Metabolized by 2 Pathways:**  
Piperidine N-dealkylation and Amide N-dealkylation.  
Alfenta is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A3/4.  
Erythromycin can inhibit the oxidizing activity of this enzyme system and decrease the clearance of Alfentanil by 50%. Cimetidine may also prolong opioid action by decreasing hepatic metabolism. Halothane can induce the activity of microsomal enzymes and has been reported to decrease the analgesic activity of alfentanil.  
Propofol inhibits the oxidative enzymatic degradation of both alfentanil and sufentanil. This is one reason why use Propofol and Remifentanil drips rather than Propofol and Alfenta.
