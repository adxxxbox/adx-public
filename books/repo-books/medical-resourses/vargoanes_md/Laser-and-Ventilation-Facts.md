### Laser and Ventilation Facts

There is a lot of documentation concerning jet ventilation with airway laser. Unfortunately only some institutions actually utilize it.

**Some Jet settings:**  
A jet ventilator connects to the side port of the laryngoscope, directing 1-2 seconds of a 40 psi oxygen flow towards the glottis, followed by 4-6 seconds for exhalation. Older techniques include intubation with a 4-6 mm Microlaryngeal tracheal (MLT) tube, intermittent apnea, and insufflation through a small catheter.

**Glossopharyngeal Nerve Block Helps Hemodynamics**  
The Glossopharyngeal nerve provides sensory innervation to the posterior third of the tongue, the vallecula, the anterior surface of the epiglottis (lingual branch), the walls of the pharynx (pharyngeal branch), and the tonsils (tonsillar branch). It is most easily blocked where it crosses the palatoglossal arch.

It can be blocked using one of three methods: topical spray application, direct mucosal contact via anesthetic-soaked pledgets, or direct infiltration by injection.

It is not adequate enough as a solo technique to facilitate intubation, but in combination with other techniques it is highly effective.

YAG lasers have a 10-fold shorter wavelength than CO­2 lasers, and therefore YAG has much better tissue penetration.  
Saline-soaked pledgets should be placed in the airway, and water should be immediately available in a 60 cc syringe.

The operating room staff personnel might need to wear special glasses and masks if a smoke evacuator is to be used.

 ETTs can be wrapped with foil tape to reflect the laser beam.         

Mallinckrodt Laser Flex Endotracheal Tube: This is a metal tube with 2 cuffs. The cuff is the only portion of the tube that is combustible.

Studies show that saline-soaked pledgets are very efficient in protecting endotracheal tube cuffs. The Laser-Shield® tube was the safest one studied. It had the highest ignition threshold of the four tubes tested.

**Post-Operative Airway Edema:**  
Always have various size ETTs available.

Place the patient on humidified oxygen (they should already be on it).  
Racemic Epinephrine nebulizer treatments for edema should be considered.  

Laryngeal spasm potential is real and should be prepared for: Anectine, ETT, Glidescope.

**Conclusion:** Subglottic jet ventilation facilitates safe airway management during microlaryngeal and laser laryngeal surgery.

**More Notes:**  
Glycopyrrolate (0.2–0.3 mg intramuscularly) 1 h before surgery may prove helpful by minimizing secretions, thereby facilitating airway visualization.

**The anesthetic goals for prolonged Laryngoscopy:**  
Muscle paralysis to provide masseter muscle relaxation for introduction of the suspension laryngoscope and an immobile surgical field.

Adequate oxygenation and ventilation.  
Cardiovascular stability during periods of rapidly varying surgical stimulation.

The potential uses and side effects of a laser vary with its wavelength, which is determined by the medium in which the laser beam is generated. For example, a medium of CO2 gas produces a long wavelength laser, whereas a medium of yttrium–aluminum–garnet (YAG) results in a shorter wavelength.

As wavelength increases, absorption by water increases and tissue penetration decreases. Thus, the effects of the CO2 laser are much more localized and superficial than those of the YAG laser.

General precautions include evacuation of toxic fumes (laser plume) from tissue vaporization; these may have the potential to transmit microbacterial diseases. Depending on the wavelength of the laser being used, all operating room personnel should wear some type of eye protection.
