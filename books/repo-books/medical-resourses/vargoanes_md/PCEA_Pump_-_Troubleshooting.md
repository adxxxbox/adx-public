### Epidural Pump Troubleshooting

  
_Similar to your IV infusion pump alarms  
PCEA (Patient Controlled Epidural Analgesia)”_

**"Air in line"**  
Press **"Silence"** to silence the annoying pump alarm.  
Press **"Stop** " That stops the pump and clears the alarm.  
Disconnect the tubing from the patient's epidural catheter.  
Press and Hold down the "Purge" or "Prime" button until the air has been cleared.  
Then reconnect the tubing to the patient's epidural catheter.  
Press the "Start" button to continue the infusion.  
  
Most of the time, the air is associated with hanging a new bag.  
Air enters the epidural (yellow) tubing and collects in the epidural filter. The epidural filter is non air eliminating and may alarm "Distal Occlusion."  
Disconnect the epidural tubing between the filter and catheter.  
Apply a sterile red cap to the epidural catheter (avoiding contamination)  
Purge the epidural tubing allowing the epidural filter to clear the air.  
If that fails, you may need to replace the epidural filter.  
  
**"Check Cassette"  
**Press **"Silence"** to silence the annoying pump alarm.Press **"Stop** " That stops the pump and clears the alarm.  
Remove and reinstall the cassette.  
Press "Start".  
  
**"Occlusion"  
**Press **"Silence"** to silence the annoying pump alarm.Press **"Stop** " That stops the pump and clears the alarm.  
Check for a tubing kink, closed clamp or tubing not behind the guides within. If it continues, remove and reinstall the cassette or tubing.  
Press "Start" to restart the infusion.  
  
**"Empty Container"  
**This is when the pump finishes infusing the programmed volume you entered similar to setting your Vol to be infused" (VTBI) with IV pumps. Hopefully, you entered a smaller amount than the total volume of the IV bag to give you time to retrieve another bag from pharmacy.  
  
**Example:** If you had a 250 mL bag, set it for 230 mL.  
Press **"Silence"** to silence the annoying pump alarm.Press **"Stop** " That stops the pump and clears the alarm.  
Change the IV bag and re-prime a new tubing/cassette and restart the pump  
  
**Leaking  
**Most pediatric epidurals have leaking at the insertion site. See patient to ensure that the epidural is in (check placement note for marking at skin). Leaking does not mean inadequate analgesia. Adult epidural catheters rarely leak. Again see the patient and check the epidural site to ensure that the epidural is in. May need to replace epidural if displaced. Discuss with attending.  
  
**Catheter disconnect** \- instruct nursing to wrap the epidural catheter in sterile gauze (our order set contains this instruction). You will need to bring a new clamp style connector and epidural filter with you. Instruct nursing to obtain new epidural tubing (possible infection risk). Clean the epidural catheter with betadine, cut with sterile scissors (obtain disposable sterile suture removal tray) **,** apply new epidural connector and filter. Resume infusion.  
  
If it is unknown how long the epidural catheter has been disconnected, most likely will need to remove the epidural catheter due to potential infection risk (discuss with attending). May need to replace epidural.
