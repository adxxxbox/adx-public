### Diabetes and Cardiac Surgery

Poor blood glucose control has been associated with worsened hospital outcomes following cardiac surgery.  
In the past an insulin drip was run only if the patient was diabetic. Now an insulin is done drip for every patient.  
  
Hyperglycemia during cardiac surgery has been associated with higher morbidity, poor wound healing, infection and impaired immune function.  
  
With hypothermia during bypass, there is a decrease in endogenous insulin secretion, which contributes to hyperglycemia.  
  
**Causes of Hyperglycemia with Cardiac Surgery**  
Hypothermia.  
Hormone response to surgical stress.  
Effects of CPB.  
Glucose containing cardioplegia (not all contain glucose).  
  
**Blood Sugar Target** 100-150 mg/dl.  
Insulin infusion protocols differ widely among institutions.
