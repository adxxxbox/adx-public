### Complications Related to Neuraxial Anesthesia

  
_Edited by LCDR Lou Grass, MSN, CRNA – US Navy_

**Complications related to neuraxial anesthesia can be broken up into three distinct components:**

1.  Physiologic side effects
2.  Issues during actual placement
3.  Drug toxicity

**Physiologic Side Effects – Exaggerated responses**

1.  Severe hypotension
2.  Severe bradycardia
3.  Severe nausea and vomiting
4.  Urinary retention
5.  High spinal or epidural level blockade
6.  Horner’s syndrome
7.  Hypoventilation
8.  Cardiac arrest
9.  Anterior spinal artery syndrome

In these cases the patient should be assessed – hypotension and bradycardia should be treated with increased fluids and vasopressors such as ephedrine or epinephrine. Remember that these two issues will result in decreased uteroplacental blood flow, possibly requiring an immediate cesarean section. Respiratory distress should be managed with ventilatory support.

**Physiologic changes to consider during neuraxial placement**

-   Engorgement of epidural vessels increasing risk of vascular injection or hematoma
-   Low protein levels in CSF – leaving increased unbound local anesthetic to work at sites.
-   Sympathetic nervous system is ramped up – a sympathectomy decreases the output to the patient and placenta.
-   There is an exaggeration of lumbar lordosis from the gravid uterus

**Issues During Actual Placement**

1.  Inadequate anesthesia or analgesia
    1.  Movement of needle during injection or catheter placement
    2.  Incomplete insertion of port into subarachnoid space
    3.  False loss of resistance
    4.  Difficult anatomy
    5.  Injection of local into paraspinous muscles instead of intended location
    6.  Subdural injection
    7.  Catheter migration or too deep an insertion
    8.  Loss of local anesthetic potency
2.  Intravascular Injection
    1.  Leads to increased serum levels with increased local doses for epidurals. Minimal with spinal dosage.
    2.  Can lead to seizures, unconsciousness, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse.
    3.  Support respirations, cardiovascular status, and administer a benzodiazepine to stop seizure activity. Consider administration of intralipid agent

**\*\*INTRALIPID DOSAGE: 20% INTRALIPID 1.5ML/KG OVER 1 MINUTE. MAY REPEAT Q3-5 MINS UP TO 3ML/KG. FOLLOW WITH DRIP RATE 0.25MG/KG/MIN. CAN INCREASE DRIP RATE TO 0.5ML/KG/MIN IF PATIENT DECOMPENSATES.**

3.  Total Spinal
    1.  Due to inadvertent intrathecal injection (wet tap)
    2.  Rapid onset due to increased volumes utilized for CLE
    3.  Support cardiovascular, neuro, and respiratory systems
4.  Subdural Injection
    1.  Much more serious because subdural space extends to intracranial space
    2.  Clinical presentation is similar to that of a high spinal
    3.  Treatment is supportive
    4.  Onset may be 15-30 minutes after injection
5.  Post Dural Puncture Headache (PDPH)
    1.  Due to any puncture of the dural sac in which CSF leaks out causing tension on cranial vessels, including migration of CLE catheter into dural sac. May be seen immediately, but more commonly presents within 12-72 hours.
    2.  Results in a front or retro-orbital headache, more prominent with sitting or standing up. May also present with photophobia and Treatment can be conservative with proper positioning, NSAIDs, caffeine intake, and increased IV fluids.
    3.  If conservative management does not work, a blood patch may be performed. An injection of the patient’s own blood, usually between 20-30ml, into the epidural space may help increase the volume lost by a CSF leak and theoretically “plug” the hole where CSF has been leaking.
6.  Neurologic Injury
    1.  Due to direct injury to spinal cord or nerve roots. Performing procedure below L1 in adults decreases chance of direct injury.
    2.  Pain on injection or paresthesias during a difficult placement may increase risk.
    3.  Direct injection of an anesthetic agent into the spinal cord may result in paralysis.
    4.  Postpartum neuro deficits may initially be blamed on a neuraxial technique. It is important to assess the severity and location of the deficit and correlate it with any possible extreme positioning during labor (i.e. sciatic stretching, lateral femoral cutaneous, or common peroneal injury).
7.  Spinal or Epidural Hematoma
    1.  Usually occurs in patients with coagulopathies, whether from intrinsic causes or medicinal therapies, platelet dysfunction, or thrombocytopenia.
    2.  Causes severe compression of neural tissue and ischemia.
    3.  Symptoms: sharp back and leg pain which progresses to paresthesias, numbness, and motor dysfunction.
    4.  Treatment: Immediate imaging (MRI, CT, or myelogram).
    5.  Surgical decompression within 8-12 hours can result in a good outcome/recovery.
8.  Epidural abscess
    1.  Rare, but related to prolonged epidural catheter placement, or inadvertent disconnection and introduction of bacteria.
    2.  Presentation within 5 days, but can be delayed.
    3.  S/S occur in 4 stages:
        1.  Back or vertebral pain
        2.  Radicular pain
        3.  Motor or sensory dysfunction
        4.  Paralysis
    4.  Treatment:
        1.  Remove catheter if still present
        2.  Culture any drainage, and send tip of cath for C&S
        3.  Treat for suspected Staph infection
        4.  Neuro consult with imaging

9.  Shearing of epidural catheter
    1.  Occurs when epidural catheter is inserted past bevel of needle and then retracted (usually 12cm mark).
    2.  Withdraw both Tuohy and catheter AT SAME TIME if catheter must be removed.
    3.  Always verify that catheter and tip are intact upon removal.
    4.  If catheter does shear:
        1.  Obtain imaging to determine location
        2.  Surgery/Neuro consult for removal

**Drug Toxicity**

**Systemic -** toxicity from labor analgesia usually follows unintended intravenous injection, but it also may be induced by administration of excessive amounts of local anesthetics. Manifestations mostly affect the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. Early indicators are those of stimulation followed by depression as blood levels rise.

**Neurologic Symptoms –** After an epidural test dose of 3ml of 1.5% lidocaine with epinephrine the patient may verbalize tinnitus, circumoral numbness, metallic taste, and dizziness. Transient neuro symptoms from the local anesthetic itself affecting nerves may include pain radiating to the legs and sensory or motor dysfunction. This is usually related to hyperbaric local anesthetic administration.

**Lidocaine Toxicity – Cauda Equina Syndrome**  
Associated with use of spinal catheters and infusion or injection of highly concentrated lidocaine (5%). Manifests as bowel or bladder dysfunction. There may also be motor and “patchy” sensory deficits.

**Cardiac Symptoms -** Beta1-adrenergic agonist effect of epinephrine in test dose results in tachycardia or palpitations. An increased amount of administered local may cause a high level of anesthesia resulting in a massive sympathectomy and hypotension, or blocking of the cardio-accelerator fibers. Fluid boluses, pressor administration, and decreasing rate of anesthetic administration will assist in maintaining perfusion
