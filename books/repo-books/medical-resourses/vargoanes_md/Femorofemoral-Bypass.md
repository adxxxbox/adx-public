### Femorofemoral Bypass

**Indication:** Treatment for iliac or femoral occlusion.

Connecting a graft that originates from a normal femoral artery in the groin on one leg and take blood to the femoral artery in the groin on the opposite leg. 

Most femoral-femoral bypasses are constructed using prosthetic grafts. Autogenous (vein) and biologic grafts (cadaveric vein or artery) may also be used if a prosthetic reconstruction is contraindicated due to presence of an active infection or contamination of the surgical field.  
  
**Anesthetic:** General or Spinal. Mostly a General.

**Duration:** 1-4 hours  
**EBL:** 200-700mLs, depends on your surgeon  
**A-line**: Yes, mostly for ACTs.  
Some surgeons don’t worry about ACTs so you may not need one.

**Heparin/Protamine:** Yes, have 10k units ready. 10k units is given before clamping.    
**Common comorbidities:**  PVD, HTN and DM.  
**Recommended BP**: Ask the surgeon.  Avoid hypotension, especially after the graft.   
**Neosynephrine drip:** Yes, treat like a CAD patient.  
**Antibiotics:** usually Ancef.  
**Warming Blanket:** Yes, these could be long cases.

**Position:** Supine with arms out.  
**IV Access:** 1-2 18G. Sometimes you need to give blood depending on the experience of your surgeon.

**Possible Complications**  
Wound infection  
Hemorrhage  
Hematoma  
Graft occlusion  
Iliac stenosis  
Seroma-fluid collecting under the wound  
DVTs, Pulmonary embolism  
Nerve injury  
Death  
  
**Protamine Concern:**  
Always watch for that rare anaphylactic reaction to Protamine.  
Remember that this rare reaction does not need a prior exposure to Protamine.

**Patients at Risk for Anaphylactic Reaction from Protamine:**  
Patients with Fish allergies have a 25% -fold risk for allergic reaction.

  
History of having a Vasectomy. Nucleoprotamines are a normal component of human sperm cells. 22-33% of patients who undergo elective vasectomies develop protamine antibodies.  
  
Diabetics on NPH insulin.  
Remember NPH stands for “Neutral Protamine Hegedorn.”

These patients have an 8% fold risk of a reaction.
