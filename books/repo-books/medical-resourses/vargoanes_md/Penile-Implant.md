Penile Implant     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Penile Implant

The most common implant is a three-component inflatable penile prosthesis. It has paired cylinders, a scrotal pump and an abdominal fluid reservoir. With these three-component devices, a larger volume of fluid is pumped into the cylinders for erection and back out of the cylinders when erection is no longer needed.

The urologist will make an incision below the head of the penis, at the base of the penis or in the lower abdomen. Sometimes the urologist will ask for relaxation if they are entering the lower abdomen.  You should ask the urologist.  
**Anesthetic**: General/LMA or ETT

Optional: Spinal; but this is rare.    
Some surgeons like the bed flexed with the head in slight Trendelenburg. An LMA would be contraindicated for that position.  
**Duration:** 1-3 hours.

If it is a re-do, there will be scar tissue to prolong the case.  
**IV access:** 20G is acceptable.  
**Antibiotics:** These are very important for this procedure. Vancomycin and other antibiotics. It is a big deal in one of my facilities if these cases are not given the correct antibiotics. Infection occurs in 1 to 3 percent of these cases. The implant will be removed if there is an infection.  
**EBL:** 10-50mLs.

**Position:** Usually supine, sometimes lithotomy or frog-legged. Sometimes flexed with legs and head slightly down.

**Possible Complications:**  
Infection  
Prosthetic malfunction
