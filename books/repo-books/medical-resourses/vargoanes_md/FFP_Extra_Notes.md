### FFP Extra Notes

**Quick Facts  
**FFP has an INR of around 1.6, so you cannot lower your patient’s below 1.7.  
The usual volume of 1 unit is ~250 ml = plasma taken from one unit of blood.Has the Vitamin K dependent factors in concentration of 1 Unit/mL.  
  
FFP must be ABO compatible  
10-20 cc/kg (4-6 units in adults) will increase factors by ~20%.  
  
It is frozen within eight hours of collection.  
  
FFP contains all coagulation factors in normal concentrations.  
  
FFP may be transfused up to 5 days after thawing and contains slightly decreased levels of Factor V (66+-9%) and decreased Factor VIII levels (41+-8%).  
  
Plasma is free of red blood cells, leukocytes and platelets.  
  
Rh factor need not be considered.  
  
There are no viable leukocytes so plasma does not carry a risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) transmission or graft vs host disease (GVHD).  
  
**Indications of for FFP  
**Patients with documented coagulation factor deficiencies and active bleeding, or who are about to undergo an invasive procedure.  
  
Deficiencies may be congenital or acquired secondary to liver disease, warfarin anticoagulation, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or massive replacement with red blood cells and crystalloid/colloid solutions.  
  
FFP should NOT be used for Hemophilia B (Factor IX) deficiency unless Factor IX concentrate is not available.  
  
FFP, but not thawed plasma, can be used for Factor V deficiency.  
  
Recombinant or Factor VIII concentrates should be used to replace Factor VIII.  
  
Usually, there is an increase of at least 1.5 times the normal PT or PTT or an INR ≥ 1.6 before clinically important factor deficiency exists. This corresponds to factor levels <30% of normal.  
  
One study showed that most FFP transfused is inappropriate (crit care med 2007;35:1655).  
  
FFP can be thawed in warm running water in 5 minutes or microwave in 6 minutes with the same activity as water bath (Anesth Analg 2006;103(4):969).  
  
FFP can probably be refrozen (Transfusion 1989;29(7):600).  
  
FFP is NOT nearly as concentrated as aPCC (FEIBA).  
  
**FFP and Warfarin Notes**  
FFP replaces coagulation factors lowered by warfarin.  
**Onset:** ~ 1-4 hours depending on dose and magnitude of anticoagulation.  
**Duration of effect:** Less than or equal to 6 hours.5-20 ml/kg IV (~ 10ml/min) provides partial warfarin reversal.  
Does not influence INR values after 12 hours when combined with Vitamin K versus Vitamin K alone.  
Use should be reserved for selected situations where an immediate partial reversal of warfarin is desired and concurrent prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) is not being administered.  
  
A rebound in the INR may be observed after the administration as the effects of the anticoagulant are commonly longer than FFP. Supplemental parenteral calcium may be necessary to reverse citrate effects.  
  
Rebound of anticoagulant effect after “reversal”: 4-6 hours.
