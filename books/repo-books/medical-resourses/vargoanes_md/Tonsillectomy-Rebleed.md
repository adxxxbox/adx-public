**Surgical Emergency**  
During a tonsillectomy rebleeding procedure, the surgeon will ligate the bleeders and use bipolar cautery to coagulate the bleeding vessels. Thrombin can also be placed over the tonsillar bed.  
  
**Posttonsillectomy Bleeding Facts**  
Common complication after an adenotonsillectomy  
  
**Primary Bleed:** < 24 hours post op (1% of tonsillectomies)  
**Secondary Bleed:** Between 5 and 12 days post op (4% of tonsillectomies)  
**Causes of secondary bleed:** Eschar sloughing off the tonsillar bed, loosening of ties or infection from underlying chronic tonsillitis.  
  
**Origin of bleeding**  
Tonsillar fossa - 67%  
Nasopharynx - 26%  
Both - 7%  
  
**Pre-op assessment  
Labs:** CBC and Coags  
Type and Cross and have blood on standby if needed before the case starts.  
**If labs are not present:** Assess LOC, capillary refill, HR and UOP  
  
FYI: Blood pressure in young kids is a poor indicator of fluid status until they are profoundly hypovolemic.  
  
**Anesthesia Considerations  
FULL stomach:** The patient may have stomach filled with blood. This is an aspiration risk.  
**Difficult Intubation:** Likely active bleeding makes for potentially poor visualization, plus airway may be edematous from the original procedure (more likely if 24 hrs).  
  
**Induction**  
Do not suction the patient’s stomach prior to induction (or post-induction- leave that to the ENT, under direct vision).  
TRUE RSI induction , avoid inhalation induction if possible.  
  
Have 2 suctions w/ yankauers available in case one clots or fails;  
Pre-oxygenate well  
  
Have 2 oral RAE ETTs–cuffed & styletted (one for back up).  
Try to get review the original anesthesia record available and review intubation.  
Ensure there is an experienced provider available for assist/back-up.  
**ETT:** Secure it well in the midline with tape (I recommend benzoin with tegaderm placed over tape and ETT, which adheres to more surface area on the patient’s chin.  
  
**Duration:** Can be quick, 5-30 minutes!  
**IV Access:** 1 large bore if possible. Anticipate Fluid resuscitation- be ready to start a large bore PIV (20g in small children, 20-18g in school-aged patients) and have phenylephrine ready.  
**PRBCs available:** Yes, send a type and cross and know about availability before you roll back to the OR with the patient.  
  
**Hydration: 4:2:1 (below is just a common reference)  
**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)  
  
**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.  
  
**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg  
  
**A-line:** Not needed  
  
**Position/Case:** HOB will be rotated 45 degrees away for the surgeon after the airway is secure. Make sure your IV, ventilator circuit, and other tubing have slack, out of the surgeon’s field but secure & easily accessible. Head and neck will be extended on head ring/-”donut” and shoulder roll. Watch that the ETT isn’t dislodged (ETT tip follows the nose), be especially vigilant when surgeon places mouth gag.  
  
When the surgeon is complete, ensure he/she passes an OGT under direct vision and fully empties/decompresses the stomach. As with the original procedure, be careful with oropharyngeal suctioning on emergence.  
**Extubation: Wide** Awake  
**Possible Complications  
**Aspiration  
More bleeding  
  
**More Notes  
****Post op bleeding Symptoms  
**Always check the back of the patient's throat with a flashlight for trickling of blood.  
  
Clots or fresh blood in the nose or throat  
Frequent swallowing  
Repetitive clearing of the throat  
Vomiting of dark blood  
Decreased BP  
Tachycardia Pallor, and restlessness are hallmark signs of hemorrhage and should be reported to the surgeon immediately.  
  
Some studies show that nausea, vomiting, and/or dehydration occur between 40% and 85% post operatively.  
PONV delays drinking fluids and increases the risk of dehydration.  
  
Kids with persistent vomiting or refusal to swallow, monitor urine output, and consider parenteral rehydration if dehydration is evident.  
  
In the PACU, ice chips and fluid are offered once the child is conscious and reflexes have returned. It is controversial whether fluids should be lukewarm or cold. Consider the child’s preferences.  
  
Avoid permitting a child in using straws or pacifiers; the sucking action can precipitate bleeding.  
  
There may be an increased throat discomfort between postoperative days 4 and 8 due to separation of eschar from the pharyngeal bed.  
  
Delayed hemorrhage can occur 7 to 10 days post procedure.
