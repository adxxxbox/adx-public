Dabigatran (Pradaxa, Pradax, Prazaxa) Reversal    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Dabigatran (Pradaxa, Pradax, Prazaxa) Reversal

**Quick Notes:  
**Dabigatran has an antidote: **idarucizumab** (Praxbind®) - see more details below.  
Only oral direct thrombin inhibitor.  
Diuresis should be encouraged by oral or IV fluid replacement to increase excretion of the drug, but diuretic drugs should be avoided as these may reduce plasma volume and increase the concentration of the drug.  
  
**Time to peak:** 1-2 hours. Trough at 12 hours.  
Steady state is achieved in 3 days.  
  
**Plasma T1/2:** 12-14 hours, five half-lives will have elapsed by 2.5 to 3.5 days after the last dose.  
  
**Renal:** _If the creatinine clearance is <30 mL/min, the half-life is >24 hr._  
  
The antidote: idarucizumab (Praxbind®) – _When administered alone with severe bleeding, it may NOT achieve bleeding management targets and PCCs may be considered._**  
  
Other Direct Thrombin Inhibitors  
**Argatroban: no antidote.  
Bivalirudin (Angiomax®): no antidote.  
Lepirudin (Refludan®): no antidote.  
  
**Thrombin Time (TT)**  
Since Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor the Thrombin Time (TT) would be a reliable lab source. If thrombin time is normal, no treatment is warranted.  
**Lab Results with** **Dabigatran** (vary by reagent and instrumentation).

**More Lab Notes  
**At therapeutic levels of dabigatran, an abnormality of the PT/INR is not expected. In a patient taking dabigatran, an elevated INR is an indication of serum levels three to four times the upper limit of normal therapeutic concentrations.  
  
**Initial Treatment**  
Creatinine Clearance > 50 ml/min: Hold drug x 1 day prior to minor surgery.  
Hold the drug 2 days prior to major surgery.  
  
Creatinine Clearance 30-50 ml/min: Hold drug 2 days prior to minor surgery.  
Hold drug x 4 days prior to major surgery.  
  
Creatinine Clearance < 30 ml/min: Hold drug x 4 days prior to minor surgery.  
Hold drug 6 days prior to major surgery.  
  
**Initial Reversal Treatment  
**Hold next dose and determine time of last dose.  
  
**Mild Bleed:** Monitor and re-check labs.  
Hold next dose or discontinue dabigatran and check aPTT.  
Apply mechanical pressure.  
  
**If PTT is normal:** Unlikely that dabigatran is contributing to bleeding.  
Optimize renal function with IV fluids to maintain diuresis.  
  
**If PTT is elevated:** dabigatran may be contributing to bleeding.  
Consider Antidote idarucizumab (Praxbind®) if urgent reversal needed.  
**idarucizumab (Praxbind®) Dose:** 5 g IV x 1, administered as 2 consecutive IV infusions of 2.5 gram vials over 5 minutes each. The second 2.5 gram vial must be administered within 15 minutes of the first vial. (see Idarucizumab note below).  
Recheck labs.  
  
**If antidote is NOT available:**  
**If ingested within 2 hours:** consider liquid charcoal with sorbitol 50 grams maximum PO x 1 dose.  
Consider Tranexamic acid: oral 1 gram (or maximum dose 25mg/kg) every 6-8hrs, or 1gram IV  
(maximum dose 15mg/kg) every 6-8hrs.  
  
**Moderate Bleed  
**Consider any of the following based on bleeding severity:  
Symptomatic treatment.  
Mechanical compression.  
Surgical intervention.  
Fluid replacement and hemodynamic support.  
Blood product transfusion.  
Consider hemodialysis/hemofiltration if rapidly available-rare.  
  
**Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU) Guide:** FOR a bleeding patient with an elevated aPTT > 40 second: Profilnine (Factor IX complex) 4000 units (50 units/kg for patients under 80 kg) plus 1 mg of rfVIIa.  
  
**If the above does NOT achieve hemostasis:  
**Consider PRBCs, depending on Hematocrit.  
Consider 2-4 units of FFP (FFP may work following profilnine)  
Hematology consult.  
**Dialysis:** With acute renal failure, initiation of hemodialysis may be considered for the purpose of facilitating drug elimination.  
Hemodialysis can remove dabigatran depending on the amount present in the plasma.  
Drug levels have been shown to rebound upon cessation of hemodialysis from tissue rebound, therefore, prolonged dialysis may be considered in selected situations.  
Can consider low dose FEIBA just prior to catheter placement for hemodialysis.  
_  
Note: The antidote a idarucizumad will directly neutralize dabigatran, limiting the need for hemodialysis as a means to expedite removal of drug._  
  
**Severe Bleed:****FFP:** Not recommended  
**rFVIIa:** Not recommended  
  
**Administer antidote:** idarucizumab ( _Praxbind_ )  
Administer **idarucizumab** (Praxbind®) 5 g IV x 1, administered as 2 consecutive IV infusions of 2.5 g vials over 5 minutes each. The second 2.5g vial must be administered within 15 minutes of the first vial.  
  
_Idarucizumab alone may NOT achieve bleeding management targets and PCCs may be considered. See note bottom of page.  
_  
**Additional Option:** Tranexamic acid.  
**Tranexamic acid:** Oral 1gram (or maximum dose is 25mg/kg) every 6-8 hours or IV 1 gram (maximum dose 15mg/kg) every 6-8hrs.  
  
**Desmopressin:** 0.3 mcg/kg SQ or IV; limit to 2 IV doses given. Increased risk of tachyphylaxis.**Life-threatening bleed  
**Hematology consult  
Idarucizumab 5gm IV bolus plu **s FEIBA™  
FEIBA** initial dose up to approximately 25 units/kg.  
A second dose (up to 25 units/kg) should be readily available if hemostasis targets are not achieved and patient is still unstable.  
  
**Tranexamic Acid Option:** 1 gram IV bolus followed by 1gram infusion over 8 hours instead of FEIBA.  
  
**For persistent refractory bleeding,** consult hematologist.  
Investigate potential causes of the bleeding.  
  
**Labs:** Serum creatinine, PT, aPTT, BMP, thrombin clotting time (TCT), ECT, Dabigatran level, LFTs and CBC.  
Renal function must be assessed.  
**If severe bleeding even after Idarucizumab, consider optional factors/treatment below:  
Tranexamic acid 1gram:** IV stat and continue (maximum dose 15mg/kg) every 6-8hours.  
Tranexamic acid may be used as an alternative to FEIBA (PCCs).**Transfuse PRBCs:** (keep Hb > 8g/dL)  
**Transfuse Platelets:** (maintain platelets >75k)  
  
**If bleeding continues, consider PCCs and other products.**  
**FEIBA:** 8-25 units/kg or Kcentra  
**Profilnine (Factor IX complex)** 4,000 units (50 units/kg) for patients under 80 kg.  
  
**Idarucizumab Note:**  
Idarucizumab will likely correct aPTT and plasma-diluted thrombin time but the correlation of lab results with improved outcomes is not established.  
Dabigatran plasma concentrations may increase more than 12-24 hours after Idarucizumab.  
This is likely due to redistribution from the extravascular compartment.
