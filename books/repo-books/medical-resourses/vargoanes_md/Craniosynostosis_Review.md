### Craniosynostosis Review

The top of a baby's skull consists of five bones that are held together by sutures. In the very first years of life the sutures serve as the most important centers of growth in the skull. The growth of the brain and the patency of the sutures depend on each other

These sutures should stay open while the baby's brain is still growing. With Craniosynostosis one or more of the fibrous sutures prematurely fuses by turning into bone (ossification) before the brain has stopped growing. If even one of the sutures closes prematurely, it can result in a misshapen skull or face. Craniosynostosis can happen before the baby is born or during the first few months of life.

Sometimes with Craniosynostosis, growth pattern provides the necessary space for the growing brain. This can cause an abnormal head shape and abnormal facial features.

If not treated, the non-pliable cranium prevents the brain from growing properly.

Treating craniosynostosis usually involves surgery to separate the fused bones. If there is no underlying brain abnormality, the surgery allows the brain adequate space for growth and development. The correction relieves cranial pressure and allows for improved self-esteem as the child ages.

**Occurance:** 1: 2,000  
**Part of a syndrome:** 15:40%  
  
**Types of Craniosynostosis**  
There are many different types of craniosynostosis. The term given to each type depends on what sutures are affected.  
  
**3 of the most common Craniosynostosis**  
  
**Sagittal Suture Synostosis**  
This is the most common form of craniosynostosis. This condition occasionally goes unrecognized until the child is too old for procedures that depend upon continued calvarial growth for success. Premature fusion of the suture at the top of the head, the sagittal suture, forces the head to grow long and narrow rather than wide.

The sagittal suture is located midline on top of the head and extends from the soft spot towards the back of the head. When the head is palpated, a ridge can be felt along the suture. Because the skull does not grow properly from side to side, the brain grows forward towards the forehead and backwards. Surgical treatment is usually late correction involving a total calvarial reconstruction.  
**Coronal Suture Synostosis**  
This involves premature fusion of a coronal suture. The coronal suture is located on the side of the head and extends from the soft spot to an area just in front of the ear. It may force the forehead to flatten on the affected side and raise the eye socket causing a deviated nose and slanted skull. It allows the forehead and frontal lobe to grow and expand forward. Premature suture closure is known as anterior plagiocephaly.  
**On the side of involvement, the following deformities develop:**  
Forehead is recessed and flattened  
Eye socket is elevated and tilted known as vertical dystopia  
Eyeball and eyelids protrude known as proptosis  
Nose deviates to the opposite side  
Deviation of the top of the head in relation to the face  
Head tilt to the side in order to prevent seeing double if untreated

**Bicoronal synostosis (brachycephaly)**  
When both of the coronal sutures fuse prematurely a flat, elevated forehead and brow is the characteristic appearance.

**Less Common Types of Craniosynostosis**

**Lambdoid synostosis (posterior plagiocephaly).**  
Premature closure of the lambdoid suture is the least common of all and has been frequently confused with positional molding of the head. This rare form of Craniosynostosis involves the lambdoid suture, which runs across the skull near the back of the head. It may cause flattening of the head on the affected side. It is frequently confused with positional molding of the head. Closure leads to posterior plagiocephalus with flattening of the back of the head on the affected side, protrusion of the mastoid bone and lowering of the affected ear. It may cause the skull to tilt sideways as well.

**Metopic Suture Synostosis (trigonocephaly)**  
The metopic suture runs from the nose to the sagittal suture. Premature fusion gives the scalp a triangular appearance.

**Scaphocephaly**  
Premature fusion of the sagittal suture forces the skull to grow long relative to its width.

**Trigonocephaly** (metopic craniosynostosis)  
Premature fusion of the metopic suture produces a narrow, triangular forehead with lateral pinching of the temples.

**Plagiocephaly**  
Premature fusion of one of the coronal or lambdoid sutures results in an asymmetrical head shape with flattening.

**Oxycephaly**  
Premature fusion of both the coronal and sagittal sutures results in an abnormally high conical head shape.

**Kleeblattschadel**  
Premature fusion of the coronal, lambdoid and posterior sagittal sutures results in a cloverleaf skull shape. This is a very rare condition.

  
**Craniosynostosis occurs in isolation but is also present in:**  
Apert  
Crouzon  
Pfeiffer  
Saethre-Chotzen  
Carpenters  
Opitz-C (Opitz Trigonocephaly) syndrome

**Genetics:**  
Most of the Craniosynostosis caused genetically are autosomal dominant inheritance.  
However, around 50% of cases are from new mutations.

**Genes most commonly mutated in Craniosynostosis are:**  
_FGFR2_  
_FGFR3_  
_TWIST1  
__EFNB1_

Non-syndrome related Craniosynostosis usually affecting the coronal suture can be caused by single gene mutations, particularly the Pro250Arg mutation in FGFR3.
