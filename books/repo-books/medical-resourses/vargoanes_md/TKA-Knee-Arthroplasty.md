### TKA - Total Knee Arthroplasty or Total Knee Replacement

Surgeon removes the damaged cartilage and bone and then positions the new metal and plastic joint surfaces to restore the alignment and function of the knee. Many different types of designs and materials are currently used in total knee replacement surgery, nearly all of which consist of three components: the femoral component (made of a highly polished strong metal), the tibial component (made of a durable plastic often held in a metal tray), and the patellar component (also plastic).

**Anesthesia:**

This is usually easy case, especially if they have a good block.

Theoretically, the patient does not even need anesthesia in the operating room with a good block. However, most patients want to be asleep or heavily sedated. Blocks are aimed for post-op pain control. Sometimes blocks do not cover the area of the tourniquet.

**General/LMA or ETT:**  
**Q: Does the patient have a big belly?** Be careful when the surgeon flexes the new knee! The surgeon will flex and push the leg up against the patient’s belly. That can externally compress the stomach and increase the risk of aspiration.

You can still intubate, or use an LMA or NC with a Propofol drip if a block was placed.  

Many of us just intubate to keep it simple. Some surgeons may want the patient in mild Trendelenburg and that’s another aspiration risk with a LMA.

**The following anesthetics and analgesic techniques are commonly used:**

**Femoral and sciatic nerve blocks** combined with spinal or general anesthesia. These are popular, and used mostly with a general anesthetic.

**Femoral nerve block** is often combined with a general or Spinal. A femoral block does not cover the posterior portion of the knee. A sciatic block covers the posterior knee.

**Epidural analgesia** is combined with spinal or general anesthesia; this is rare. Most of us will use Spinal anesthesia alone; and we may inject a small dose of Fentanyl or Duramorph for post op pain control.  
 

**General anesthesia (GA) alone:** With general anesthesia alone, pain management could be a challenge, especially post-operatively.

**Femoral and Sciatic nerve blocks** are most commonly used in up to date orthopedic facilities.

**Duration:** 1-2 hours

**Position:** supine with arms out

**IV Access:** 18G  
**Type and Cross:** Usually  
**EBL:** around 100 mLs.  
**Tourniquet:** yes  
**Tranexamic Acid Protocol:** Sometimes, we are ordered to give 20mg/kg right before the cement is mixed. Be aware of contraindications. It decreases blood loss. Many surgeons still don’t use it.  
**Platelet Gel:** Sometimes a rep may ask you to draw 20cc of blood to mix to make platelet gel in pre-op when you start the IV or when the patient goes to sleep. Platelet Gel helps with the healing.

**Complications:** 

DVTs  
Methyl methacrylate-related complications.  
PE  
Peroneal Nerve Injury.  
Vascular injury to popliteal vessels.
