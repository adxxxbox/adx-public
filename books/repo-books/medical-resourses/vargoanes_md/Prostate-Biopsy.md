### Prostate Biopsy, Transrectal or Transperineal, Ultrasonically Guided

Indications:

For prostates smaller than 40mL or those with an anteroposterior diameter of less than 5cm is best suited for this.

The procedure:

-   A transrectal ultrasound probe is passed through the anus and into the rectum.
-   A needle is passed through the perineum and guided to the prostate gland via ultrasound.
-   Biopsies are taken from the targeted area within the prostate.
-   A spring-loaded biopsy gun with an 18G needle is utilized to take these biopsies.
-   Do not take the patient to the operating room until the ultrasound tech arrives.
-   The case is may be performed on the patient's stretcher or on the operating room table.

**Anesthesia management:** The same as a regular transperineal biopsy.

**Propofol infusion:** Enough to keep the patient from moving.

**Deep MAC,** usually just a propofol infusion

General with ETT or LMA for patients who cannot tolerate a MAC.

Common cocktail:

-   100 mcg of fentanyl followed by a low-dose propofol infusion starting at 50 mcg/kg/min.
-   Titrate to effect.
-   Have a 200 mg syringe of propofol for small boluses as needed.

**Positioning:** Usually lithotomy.

Some surgeon’s still prefer the patient in the left lateral decubitus position, knees flexed up towards the chest in the Sims position.

**Duration:** 10-20 minutes

**EBL:** Minimal

Possible Complications/side effects:

**Bleeding:** This is the most common complication, occurring in up to 50% of cases.

It can manifest as blood in the urine (hematuria), blood in the semen (hematospermia), or rectal bleeding.

**Pain:** Pain at the biopsy site or in the pelvic area is common and usually temporary.

**Urinary tract infection:** This can occur in up to 5% of cases and easily treated with antibiotics.

**Difficulty urinating:** This can be a temporary issue due to swelling or bruising at the biopsy site.

Less common complications/side effects:

**Vasovagal response:** This is a fainting spell that can occur during or after the procedure.

**Prostate cancer seeding:** This is a rare complication where cancer cells are unintentionally spread along the needle tract.

**Persistent bleeding:** In rare cases, bleeding can continue for several days or weeks.

**Rectal injury:** This is a rare complication that can cause pain, rectal bleeding, or difficulty passing stool.
