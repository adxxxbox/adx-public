### PCEA vs Epidural Continuous Infusion

PCEA (Patient Controlled Epidural Analgesia)

Studies show that a PCEA pump is superior to an old traditional Continuous Effusion pump that does not offer extra boluses (Demand Dose).  
  
**PCEA (Patient Controlled Epidural Analgesia) Review  
**PCEA differs from the continuous infusion technique in that the parturient herself can fine-tune the dose of analgesic she receives. She can receive an extra bolus when needed.  
  
**Advantage of PCEA Pump  
**Lower continuous infusion rates.  
Patients often forget to press a demand dose resulting in less hourly dose.  
Less motor block.  
Less intervention by the anesthesia provider.  
Patient feels in control.  
  
Less Intervention by the Anesthesia Provider  
Studies show that there is a decreased need for an anesthesia provider to administer additional top off doses and it lowers the incidence of motor block.  
New approaches to administering PCEA have been suggested, such as using automated mandatory boluses instead of a continuous background infusion to decrease analgesic consumption.Studies have showed a reduction in the hourly consumption of ropivacaine.  
A larger proportion of parturients in the PCEA AMB group did not self-bolus.
