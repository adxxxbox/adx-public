### Epidural Catheter Pulls

Removal of the epidural catheter is very easy and should have no resistance.  
  
If resistance is met, it is often helpful to ask the patient to flex her back or assume the position that she was in during epidural placement.  
  
Always look at the tip of the catheter and make sure it is intact. Make sure you document that the tip is intact. The tip has a characteristic appearance depending upon the manufacturer. Most epidural catheter tips are blue.  
  
After the catheter is pulled, you can close out the chart, or computer record.  
  
Empty the infusion bag and document waste in mLs on the anesthetic record.  
  
If a patient has any complications such as atony, retained products, or excessive bleeding during delivery, the catheter may be left in place longer to maintain access in the event the patient requires surgery.
