Cervical Cerclage Spinal Doses    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Cervical Cerclage Spinal Doses

Cervical cerclage is the placement of stitches in the cervix to hold it closed. This procedure is most often performed via transvaginal.

**Indications:** To keep the incompetent cervix from opening early. When a cervix opens early, it may cause preterm labor and delivery.  
A cervical cerclage is a much shorter procedure than a C-section.

**Dermatome Level**: T 12 (high saddle block)  
Pudendal S2-S4 and genitofemoral (L1–2) nerves supply the surgical area.

The optimal doses of ropivacaine and bupivacaine in combination with fentanyl have also been studied. Ropivacaine 10-20 mg with fentanyl 10- 15 mcg is acceptable, as is bupivacaine 5-10 mg with fentanyl 10-15 mcg.

**Spinal Doses for Cerclage Procedure**  
1.0-1.2 mL hyperbaric 0.75% bupivacaine is the most common dose  
1.0-1.2 mL hyperbaric 5% lidocaine-not as common

_Lidocaine was historically the most popular drug of choice, but it is now less common because of the concerns of transient neurologic symptoms (TNS)._

Patient should remain sitting for 3-5 minutes to establish saddle block.
