### Fentanyl (Sublimaze) Notes

**Generic Name:** Fentanyl citrate**Brand Name:** Sublimaze  
**Drug Class:** Phenylpiperidine opioid  
**Antidote:** Naloxone (opioid antagonists)  
**Incompatible with:** Thiopentone sodium and methohexitone sodium  
**Concentration:** 50 mcg/mL  
  
\- Fentanyl, a synthetic pure opioid agonist, acts primarily through interaction with mu-opioid receptors in the brain, spinal cord, and smooth muscle.  
\- The primary site of therapeutic action in the CNS.  
\- The most clinically useful pharmacological effect of the interaction of fentanyl with mu-opioid receptors is analgesia  
\- Fentanyl is similar to morphine and produces analgesia but to a greater extent.  
\- Paul Janssen structurally designed fentanyl in the early 1960s.  
\- A sterile, non-pyrogenic, preservative-free aqueous solution.  
**Receptors activation:**  
\- Fentanyl is a mu-opioid receptor (mOR) agonist located in the brain, spinal cord and smooth muscle for its primary analgesia.  
\- It may also activate delta and kappa-opioid receptors.  
\- The neurotransmitter dopamine (Da) is increased in the reward areas of the brain, which elicits the stereotypical exhilaration and relaxation effects.  
\- It is typically associated with the addiction to the drug.  
  
**Mechanism of action:**\- Fentanyl binds to opioid receptors, especially the mu-opioid receptor, coupled to G-proteins.  
\- Activation of opioid receptors causes GTP to be exchanged for GDP on the G-proteins, which in turn down-regulates adenylate cyclase, reducing concentrations of cAMP.  
\- Reduced cAMP decreases the cAMP-dependent influx of calcium ions into the cell.  
\- The exchange of GTP for GDP results in hyperpolarization of the cell and inhibition of nerve activity.  
  
**Fentanyl pharmacokinetics:** Refer to _"Fentanyl (Sublimaze) Pharmacokinetics”_ for details  
  
**Perioperative indications of fentanyl:  
**Preoperative analgesia  
Anesthesia adjunct  
Regional anesthesia adjunct  
General anesthesia  
Post-operative pain control  
Moderate to severe acute pain (off-label)  
Often an induction agent for open-heart surgery.  
**Note:** Fentanyl transdermal patches are common for chronic pain**  
  
Advantages of fentanyl (in addition to the benefits of most opioids):  
**\- Rapid onset  
\- High potency (100 times compared with morphine)  
\- Minimal effect on myocardial or hemodynamic function (open heart surgery induction drug)  
\- Causes no to minimal histamine release, safe for asthmatics  
\- Cheaper than sufentanil, alfentanil, and remifentanil.  
\- It is extremely rare to cause an allergic reaction.  
\- Its most common use is as a sedative in intubated patients.  
\- Pain control in patients with renal failure due to its primarily hepatic elimination.

**  
First-pass pulmonary uptake:  
**\- The lungs also serve as a large inactive storage site.  
\- Around 75% of the initial fentanyl dose undergoes first-pass pulmonary uptake.  
\- This limits the initial amount of drug that reaches the systemic circulation.  
(Stoelting’s Pharmacology & Physiology in Anesthetic Practice, 2022)  
**  
Metabolism of fentanyl:  
**\- Fentanyl is extensively (99%) metabolized via CYP3A4 to norfentanyl.  
\- It can also be amide hydrolyzed to despropionylfentanyl, or alkyl hydroxylated to hydroxyfentanyl which is N-dealkylated to hydroxynorfentanyl.  
\- All metabolites are inactive and a small amount of fentanyl is eliminated via the kidneys unchanged  
  
**Fentanyl metabolites:**  
\- Norfentanyl  
\- Despropionylfentanyl  
\- Hydroxyfentanyl  
\- Hydroxy-proprionyl-fentanyl  
  
**Fentanyl is a respiratory depressant.  
**\- Fentanyl frequently slows the respiratory rate, duration, and the degree of respiratory depression is dose-related.  
\- Hypoventilation resulting from fentanyl or other narcotics during MAC anesthesia results in elevated PaCO2 and possibly respiratory failure.  
\- An elevated PaCO2 in a patient with pulmonary hypertension can trigger a pulmonary hypertension crisis.  
\- During anesthesia, these high-risk pulmonary patients can be managed by assisted or controlled respiration.  
\- It has been reported that secondary rebound respiratory depression may occasionally occur postoperatively.  
\- Respiratory depression secondary to chest wall rigidity has also been reported in the postoperative.  
\- Patients should be monitored for this possibility and appropriate countermeasures taken as necessary.  
  
**Fentanyl alters the respiratory sensitivity to CO2 stimulation.  
**\- The reduced sensitivity to CO2 stimulation may persist longer than the depression of the respiratory rate.  
\- Altered sensitivity to CO2 stimulation has been demonstrated for up to four hours following a large single dose of fentanyl in healthy volunteers.  
  
**Possible symptoms/adverse effects of an overdose:  
**Blurred vision  
Nausea  
Emesis  
Diaphoresis  
Pruritus  
Urticaria  
Laryngospasm  
Respiratory degression  
Somnolence  
Stupor  
Coma  
Skeletal muscle flaccidity  
Cold and clammy skin  
Pupillary constriction  
Pulmonary edema  
Bradycardia  
Hypotension  
Airway obstruction  
Atypical snoring  
Cardiac arrest  
Cyanosis  
Death  
**Muscle rigidity from high doses of fentanyl:  
**\- Fentanyl may cause muscle rigidity, particularly involving the muscles of respiration.  
\- This rigidity has been reported to occur or recur infrequently in the extended postoperative period usually following high-dose administration.  
\- This effect is related to the dose and speed of injection.  
**  
Precautions with fentanyl:  
Geriatrics:  
**As with other narcotics, the initial dose of fentanyl citrate should be reduced in elderly and debilitated patients.  
**  
Drug Interactions:  
**\- Other CNS depressant drugs (e.g. barbiturates, tranquilizers, opioids and general anesthetics) will have additive or potentiating effects with fentanyl.  
\- When patients have received such drugs, the dose of fentanyl required will be less than usual.  
\- Following the administration of fentanyl citrate, the dose of other CNS depressant drugs should be reduced.  
  
**Caution with the concomitant administration of fentanyl and the following agents:**  
Tranquilizers  
Neuroleptic drugs  
SSRIs  
**CYP3A4 inhibitors** (macrolide antibiotics or azole-antifungal agents)  
Post cessation of CYP3A4 inducers (i.e., carbamazepine, phenytoin)  
Protease inhibitors (HIV agents)Barbiturates  
Other opioids  
Benzodiazepines  
General anesthetics  
  
**Tranquilizers and fentanyl:  
**\- The combination of the two is associated with a decrease in pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and hypotension.  
\- If hypotension occurs, it is believed to be related to hypovolemia, and administering of volume should be considered.**  
  
Concomitant use of neuroleptic agents should be monitored.  
**\- Cases of cardiac dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death have been reported following the use of fentanyl citrate with a neuroleptic agent\- Many neuroleptic agents have been associated with QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, and cardiac arrest.  
\- ECG monitoring is indicated perioperatively when a neuroleptic agent is used in conjunction with fentanyl.  
  
**Concomitant use of SSRIs may precipitate serotonin syndrome.  
**_\- Fentanyl_ and other phenylpiperidine opioids (eg, meperidine, tramadol, sufentanil, alfentanil and remifentanil) seem to be weak SSRIs and may also enhance serotonin release.  
\- The interaction between the two classes of drugs resulting in serotonin syndrome is not fully understood.  
\- Many of these patients developed severe symptoms and required emergency care.  
\- The occurrence is rare but well documented.  
  
**Concomitant use of** **CYP3A4 inhibitors** **may result in elevated fentanyl plasma levels.**\- Fentanyl should not be used concomitant with CYP3A4 inhibitors like macrolide antibiotics, azole-antifungal agents and protease inhibitors because they may increase plasma concentrations of fentanyl.**  
  
Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 include:**  
Clarithromycin  
Erythromycin  
Diltiazem  
Itraconazole  
Ketoconazole  
Ritonavir  
Verapamil  
Goldenseal  
Grapefruit  
**  
Concomitant use with the cessation of CYP3A4 inducers:  
**\- On the other hand, the cessation of a CYP3A4 inducer medication (i.e., carbamazepine, phenytoin) may result in decreased levels of CYP3A4 resulting in increased plasma concentrations of fentanyl.  
**  
Concomitant use Protease inhibitors for HIV (ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, etc)**  
\- Protease inhibitors are potent inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme.  
\- The concomitant administration with fentanyl **can reduce** the clearance of fentanyl by 67% resulting in elevated fentanyl plasma concentration.  
  
**Nitrous oxide and fentanyl:  
**\- The combination of nitrous oxide and higher doses of fentanyl has been reported to produce cardiovascular depression.  
\- Reduction of the fentanyl dose may be necessary.**  
  
Benzodiazepines:  
**\- Benzodiazepines are not considered respiratory depressants when administered alone.  
\- When combined with fentanyl (or other narcotics), the respiratory depression effects of fentanyl are enhanced.  
  
**Fentanyl should be used with caution with:  
**\- Liver failure  
\- Renal failure\- After operative interventions in the biliary tract (may slow hepatic elimination)  
\- Obstructive airway diseases (i.e., asthma, COPD, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation, also known as, Pickwickian syndrome)\- Patients with decreased respiratory reserve  
\- Pulmonary hypertension  
\- Chronic dialysis patients (many develop pulmonary hypertension)  
\- Non-intubated pediatric patients  
\- With known intolerance to fentanyl or other morphine-like drugs  
  
**Fentanyl and Nitrous oxide:  
**\- Fentanyl should be administered with caution to patients with liver and kidney dysfunction because of the importance of these organs in the metabolism and excretion of drugs.  
\- A reduction in metabolism and/or clearance may lead to respiratory depression.  
**  
Obstructive airway diseases:  
**\- Fentanyl is a respiratory depressant that may result in hypoventilation and hypercapnia in spontaneously breathing patients.  
\- This may cause respiratory failure in airway compromised patients with little reserve.  
  
**Pulmonary hypertension (PHT):  
**\- For the same reason written above, hypercapnia from hypoventilation in a spontaneously breathing patient will increase pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and possibly result in a pulmonary hypertensive crisis.  
  
**Chronic dialysis patients (spontaneously breathing):**  
\- Many chronic dialysis patients have group 5.4 PHT.  
\- They are also at risk for a pulmonary hypertensive crisis for the same reason above.  
\- Be cautious with MAC cases involving AV-graft revisions with spontaneously breathing chronic dialysis patients.  
  
**Cardiovascular effects:  
**\- Fentanyl may produce bradycardia, which may be treated with glycopyrrolate or atropine.  
\- It should be used with caution in patients with cardiac bradyarrhythmias.  
  
**Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility:  
**No carcinogenicity or mutagenicity studies have been conducted with fentanyl.  
  
**Pregnancy:** Category C:  
\- There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on pregnant women.  
\- No evidence of teratogenic effects has been observed in humans or lab animals.  
\- Opioid analgesic agents can cause neonatal respiratory depression.  
\- With long-term use during pregnancy, there is a risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome which may be life-threatening.  
\- Fentanyl should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.  
  
**Maternal fentanyl and labor and delivery:  
**\- It is advised not to use fentanyl during labor and delivery (including cesarean section) because fentanyl passes through the placenta and may cause respiratory depression in the fetus.  
\- The placental transfer ratio is 0.44, fetal:maternal ratio is 1.00:2.27.  
  
**Breastfeeding:**  
\- Fentanyl passes into breast milk and may cause sedation and respiratory depression in the breastfed child.  
\- Fentanyl should not be used by breastfeeding women and breastfeeding should not be restarted until at least 5 days after the last administration of fentanyl.  
  
**Pediatric use:  
**\- The safety and efficacy of fentanyl citrate in children under two years of age have not been established.  
\- Limited doses of fentanyl are commonly administered in intubated pediatric patients during surgical procedures.  
  
**Fentanyl and methemoglobinemia have been reported in premature neonates.**  
\- Rare cases of unexplained clinically significant methemoglobinemia have been reported in premature neonates undergoing emergency anesthesia and surgery which included the combined use of fentanyl, pancuronium, and atropine.  
\- A direct cause and effect relationship has not been established.  
**  
No evidence of seizure activity from fentanyl:  
**With fentanyl, there is an absence of EEG evidence of seizure activity, however, it is difficult to distinguish opioid-induced skeletal muscle rigidity or myoclonus from seizure activity.  
  
**Opioid-induced skeletal muscle rigidity or myoclonus:**  
\- As mentioned above, opioids might produce a form of myoclonus secondary to depression of inhibitory neurons that would produce a clinical picture of seizure activity.  
  
**Somatosensory-Evoked Potentials and Electroencephalogram:**  
\- Fentanyl in doses exceeding 30 mcg/kg IV produces changes in somatosensory-evoked potentials that, although detectable, do not interfere with the use and interpretation of this monitor during anesthesia.  
\- Opioids, including fentanyl, attenuate skeletal muscle movement at doses that have little effect on the EEG.  
  
**Head Injuries and increases in intracranial pressure (ICP):  
**\- Fentanyl should be used with caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to respiratory depression, such as comatose patients who may have a head injury or brain tumor.  
\- Fentanyl plasma protein binding capacity decreases with the increasing ionization of the drug.  
\- Alterations in pH may affect its distribution between plasma and the central nervous system.  
\- Fentanyl accumulates in the lungs, skeletal muscle, and fat, and is released slowly into the blood.  
\- Fentanyl is primarily transformed in the liver.  
**  
Fentanyl in elderly patients has a longer duration than in younger patients.**  
Fentanyl has a prolonged elimination half-time in elderly patients due to its decreased clearance.  
**  
This can be due to age-related:**  
\- Decreases in hepatic blood flow  
\- Decreased microsomal enzyme activity  
\- Decreased albumin production (fentanyl) highly protein-bound  
  
**Prolonged infusions of fentanyl:**  
\- A continuous infusion of fentanyl greater than two hours will prolong the return of the opioid from peripheral compartments back into the plasma.  
\- This delays the rate of plasma clearance after the continuous infusion is discontinued as it still needs the be metabolized.  
**  
The initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) decreases fentanyl plasma concentrations.  
**\- A significant proportion of fentanyl (and other drugs) adheres to the surface of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit resulting in decreased plasma levels.  
\- Opioids that have a large volume distribution (Vd) are the least affected.  
**  
Illicit uses:  
**\- Fentanyl is abused for its intense euphoric effects.  
\- Fentanyl can serve as a direct substitute for heroin in opioid-dependent individuals.  
\- However, fentanyl is a very dangerous substitute for heroin because it is much more potent than heroin and results in frequent overdoses that can lead to respiratory depression and death.
