### Epidural Adjuvants

**Epinephrine (Epi)  
**Epinephrine will increase the duration of action for all local anesthetics and has antinociceptive effects on patients.  
  
**How Epi increases duration in Epidurals  
**Epi causes vasoconstriction to the nearby blood vessels, thus reducing clearance of the local anesthetics from the epidural space and reduces the risk of systemic toxicity and reduces the absorption of local anesthetics and opioids.  
  
**Epi has analgesic (antinociceptive) effects  
**Epinephrine has an antinociceptive effect when injected into the subarachnoid space. Epinephrine exerts its analgesic effect through the stimulation of α2 adrenergic receptors.  
These presynaptic adrenergic receptors are found at the terminals of primary afferent neurons. They can also be found in the spinal cord -in the substantia gelatinosa of the dorsal horn.  
  
_Common doses of Epi per epidural = 5 mcg/mL (1-200,000) with lidocaine. It nearly doubles the duration of epidural lidocaine anesthesia._  
  
**Local anesthetics with greatest duration increases from Epi**  
Lidocaine  
Mepivacaine  
2-chloroprocaine  
  
**Local Anesthetics with LEAST effect from Epi**  
Bupivacaine  
Levobupivacaine  
Etidocaine  
  
One study showed that adding Epi 3.3 mc/mL of 0.5% bupivacaine had NO effect on maternal venous plasma concentrations in laboring women. 5mcg of Epi per mL of bupivacaine showed no effect with C-sections.  
  
**Don’t mix Epi with Ropivacaine**  
Epi is not added to ropivacaine due to its inherent vasoconstrictive effects. There is also no change in duration.  
  
**Epi is better than Neosynephrine**  
Epi is more effective in reducing peak blood levels of local anesthetics when compared to neosynephrine.  
  
**Sodium Bicarbonate  
**Sodium bicarbonate added to local anesthetics has several positive effects, including an increase in the concentration of free base, which enhances the rate of diffusion, speeding onset.  
As you know, local anesthetics are weak bases with a pKa higher than physiologic pH. The addition of bicarb increases the pH of the local anesthetic and increases the pH closer to the local anesthetic. This change increases the un-ionized form that is available to penetrate the nerve membrane. This accelerates the onset of the block and decreases the minimum concentration required for a conduction blockade. The amount of bicarb needed is unique to each anesthetic.  
  
**NaHCO3 most commonly added to what local anesthetics?  
**Lidocaine  
Mepivacaine  
2-chloroprocaine  
  
**NaHCO3 less popular with bupivacaine  
**When NAHCO3 is added to bupivacaine, precipitation occurs above a pH of 6.8. If bicarbonate is added, it should be in a ratio of 0.1 ml of bicarbonate to every 10 ml of bupivacaine.  
  
**NaHCO3 and onset**  
Most studies show that bicarb added to lidocaine, bupivacaine, or 2-chloroprocaine shortens the onset of an epidural block by as much as 10 minutes.  
  
**NaHCO3 offers a faster onset**  
Addition of sodium bicarbonate to 1.5% lidocaine produces a significantly faster onset of sensory blockade/anesthesia, and a more complete block.  
  
**Dose of NAHCO3  
**One (1) mEq of bicarbonate is added to every 10 ml of local anesthetic  
  
**Clonidine  
**As you already now, Clonidine is an α2 agonist and works the same way as Precedex.  
Clonidine’s strength as an adjunct to a neuraxial administered local anesthetic is improving analgesia without affecting sensation or producing motor blockade.  
Less urinary retention than morphine.  
**Epidural Clonidine Doses:** 150-300 mcg can prolong the duration of a block by 1 hour.  
Lower doses can be used when combined with an opioid and local anesthetic resulting in less hypotension.  
Epidural Clonidine is rapidly cleared into the plasma and redistributed to brain sites and causes sedation.  
Sedation peaks within 1-2 hours and may last up to 8 hours.  
Unlike Epi, Clonidine works well with long lasting local anesthetics.  
  
**Disadvantages of Clonidine**  
May cause sedation by α2 adrenergic stimulation in the locus ceruleus.  
May cause hypotension- by acting on α2 adrenergic receptors on preganglionic cholinergic neurons.  
May also cause bradycardia.  
  
FDA has issued a “Black Box” against the use of Clonidine in obstetrics for the concerns of hemodynamic instabilities after its use.  
  
Combining local anesthetics (blocks channels), opioids (act at mu receptors), epinephrine  
(agonists at α2 adrenergic receptors) allows for a multi modal approach to treating pain through synergism.  
  
**Neostigmine  
**Muscarinic and Nicotinic cholinergic receptors are present in the dorsal horns of the spinal cord.  
Neostigmine prevents the breakdown of acetylcholine in the spinal cord. The acetylcholine then binds to muscarinic and nicotinic receptors of the spinal cord.  
When muscarinic receptors are stimulated, they facilitate the release of GABA in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord causing analgesia.  
Neostigmine has not been approved by the FDA for neuraxial anesthesia and has major nausea and GI side effects.
