# Lactated Ringers

**Lactated Ringers (LR, RL, LRS, Hartman's Solution)**  
The most common fluid we administer intra-operatively.  
Has an electrolyte concentration similar to serum, but without magnesium.  
A slighty HYPOtonic crystalloid volume expander that expands circulating blood volume.  
**Trivia:**  
For every liter it provides 100 mLs of free water and tends to lower serum Na.  
1L crystalloid causes a 17% reduction in Hb.  
So a starting Hb will go from 12g/dL down to 10g/dL.  
Intravascular half life is only 20-30 minutes.  
**One liter of lactated Ringer's solution contains:**  
130 mEq of sodium ion = 130 mmol/L.  
109 mEq of chloride ion = 109 mmol/L.  
28 mEq of lactate = 28 mmol/L.  
4 mEq of potassium ion = 4 mmol/L.  
3 mEq of calcium ion = 1.5 mmol/L.  
**Calories:** 9  
pH: 6.5, but it's still considered an alkalizing solution.  
Has an osmolality of 273 mOsm/L.  
**Anesthesia Indications**  
For use in adults and pediatric patients as a source of electrolytes and water for hydration.  
Solution of choice for burns.  
Most cases of dehydration.  
Supportive treatment of trauma.  
However, too much LR can cause a metabolic alkalosis secondary to metabolism of lactate (which produces bicarbonate).  
**Contraindications**  
**Renal failure:** it contains K+ and may lead to hyperkalemia.  
**Liver disease:** Liver can't break down the lactate in the solution.  
**Lactic acidosis or alkalosis:** however-studies now show that with a healthy patient, 1L of LR over 1h does not falsely increase circulating lactate levels.  
When the administration of sodium, potassium, calcium, lactate, or chloride could be clinically detrimental.  
Should also not be used in patients with a pH level >7.5.  
**Disadvantages**  
The Ca+ in LR can bind to certain drugs and reduce their bioavailability and efficacy.  
The Ca+ in LR can bind to the citrated anticoagulant in blood products. This can inactivate the anticoagulant and promote the formation of clots in donor blood. Studies now refute this, but we still use NSS when giving blood.  
LR can cross the blood brain barrier and cause cerebral edema with craniotomies.  
Rapid administration of large amounts > 4-5 Liters is more frequently associated with significant tissue edema.  
**Warnings: LR can cause:**  
Fluid and/or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations.  
Overhydration  
CHF and Pulmonary Edema  
Peripheral Edema  
**Adverse Reactions**  
Allergic reactions or anaphylactoid symptoms such as:  
Localized or generalized urticaria and pruritus  
Periorbital, facial, and/or laryngeal edema  
Coughing, sneezing, and/or SOB  
The reporting frequency of these signs and symptoms is higher in women during pregnancy  
**Lactated Ringer Facts**  
Invented in the early 1880s by Sydney Ringer, a British physician and physiologist.  
The lactate is metabolized into bicarbonate by the liver, which can help correct metabolic acidosis.  
Preferred over NSS with hemorrhage because it is much closer to our natural pH and concentrations of Na, Cl, K and Ca, which may make it preferable.  
Remember a crystalloid as a low molecular weight ions (salts) with or without glucose, whereas colloid solutions contain high molecular weight substances such as proteins or large glucose polymers.
