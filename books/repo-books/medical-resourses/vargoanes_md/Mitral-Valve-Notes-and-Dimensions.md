### Mitral Valve Notes and Dimensions

The mitral valve connects the left atrium (LA) and the left ventricle (LV). The mitral valve opens during diastole to allow the blood flow from the LA to the LV. During ventricular systole, the mitral valve closes and prevents backflow to the LA.

**The normal function of the mitral valve depends on its 6 components:**  
left atrial wall  
annulus  
leaflets  
chordae tendinae  
papillary muscles  
left ventricular wall

**Normal Mitral Valve Area**  
Normal mitral valve area is 4-6cm squared (4-6cm²).  
Patients are usually still asymptomatic at 2cm².

**"Critical stenosis"** is defined as 1 cm squared or less and is usually symptomatic at rest. 1-1.5cm² usually causes mild symptoms on exertion. Assuming a constant area, small changes in CO or diastolic time (with tachycardia) can lead to large changes in the pressure gradient. LA pressures > 25mmHg will lead to acute pulmonary edema, and if present in the long term, will lead to increased PVR.
