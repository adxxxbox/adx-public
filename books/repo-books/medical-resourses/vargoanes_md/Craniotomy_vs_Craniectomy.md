## Craniotomy vs Craniectomy

Both procedures involve removing a portion of the skull, usually to perform surgery on the brain.

After a **craniotomy** the bone is replaced.  
After a **craniectomy** the bone is not replaced immediately.

With a craniectomy, the bone flap is left off, in order to allow the brain more room for expansion. The bone flap is usually stored in a freezer until the brain has sufficiently recovered and then a second surgery is performed to return the bone flap to the skull. If the bone flap cannot be replaced, artificial bone or plates may be used to do the reconstruction of the skull. Often times, there will be a less than perfect fusion of the skull after the surgery, resulting in defects in the skull.

The amount of skull that needs to be removed depends to a large extent on the type of surgery being performed. The bone flap is then replaced using titanium plates and screws or another form of fixation (wire, suture, etc.).
