### EP Lab Cases (Electrophysiology Lab)

Three main types of procedures are performed in the EP lab: 

**Electrophysiology (EP) Studies**  
This is a diagnostic procedure that can produce complex 3-D mapping of the electrical activity in the heart. They could also use other methods to enable the physician to pinpoint the type and the source of the abnormal rhythm.

  
**Implantable Devices**  
Insertion of Pacemakers and AICDs  
  
**Cardiac Ablation or Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA):** Eliminate an arrhythmia by inserting a catheter into the veins, guiding it to the heart and delivering radiofrequency energy to neutralize the electrical cells that are causing the problem.
