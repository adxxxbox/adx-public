### Tips Procedure

A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a percutaneously created connection within the liver between the PORTAL and SYSTEMIC circulations.

**Goal:** To divert portal blood flow into the hepatic vein (bypassing the liver), to reduce the pressure gradient between portal and systemic circulations. Shunt patency is maintained by placing an expandable metal stent within the liver tissue creating a connection (shunt) between the portal and hepatic vein.

  
**Indications:**  
Acute or recurrent variceal bleeding that cannot be controlled.  

Many institutions don’t use anesthesia and basically use conscious sedation.

Other hospitals prefer general anesthesia during TIPS because of the prolonged nature of the procedure and the degree of discomfort that many patients experience during the transvenous punctures.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT, sometimes MAC

The interventional radiologist wants no patient movement, so we usually intubate and relax them. I have seen an LMA used, but this is very rare.  
**Head Position:** Ask the radiologist which way the patient’s head will be turned. The right internal jugular vein is usually accessed with ultrasonographic guidance. The left jugular vein may also used if the right vein is unsuitable for any reason. Techniques involving a femoral venous approach have also been described, but these are used much less commonly, and they are technically more demanding  
The surgeon will stand at the patient’s head between you and your patient. So make sure all your tubing is out of the way.  
  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**IV Access:** 18G incase of a bleed.  
**EBL:** Minimal, there is still potential for a hemorrhage since the liver is being punctured.  
**Position:** Supine  
**A-line:** Sometimes. They are not really needed. We used to always put them in for these cases.

**Coagulation Issues**  
Patients with cirrhosis often have severe coagulopathy and they should be addressed prior to any invasive procedure.

Platelets are routinely administered when platelets are < 50k.

FFP is administered with an INR >2.0.

**Contraindications:**

Active intrahepatic or systemic infection (bacteria can colonize the stent, causing persistent infection).

Severe hepatic encephalopathy poorly controlled with medical therapy.

Hypervascular hepatic tumors.

**Possible Complications**

Although TIPS remains a relatively safe procedure, direct procedure-related complication rates during TIPS have been reported in up to 20% of procedure  
Reaction to iodinated dye  
Liver laceration  
Sepsis/infection  
Biliary puncture and fistula formation  
Inadvertant hepatic artery puncture  
Non target organ puncture-gallbladder, right kidney, duodenum and colonic hepatic flexure.

Shunt malposition  
Device migration  
Vessel trauma during coil embolization  
**Post Tips:** Liver Ischemia, Infarction and Failure  
Tips occlusion  
  
**Other Notes**

The interventional radiologists usually enters the right IJ and advances a guide wire (followed by a sheath) down to the right hepatic vein. A long curved needle is placed through the sheath and thrust through the wall of the hepatic vein and adjacent liver tissue, then into a major branch of the portal vein. Proper placement that the catheter is now within the portal vein is confirmed via  wedged hepatic venogram. A balloon catheter is used to dilate the newly created tract (within the liver tissue) between the hepatic and portal vein. A stent is then inserted into this dilated tract creating a new patent pathway between the hepatic and portal vein. The stent actually extends 2cm into the portal vein. Portal vein pressure is measured to make sure it was lowered.

This new stent directs portal blood flow directly into the hepatic vein bypassing the liver.

Portal vein (PV) patency should be confirmed prior to attempts at TIPS placement
