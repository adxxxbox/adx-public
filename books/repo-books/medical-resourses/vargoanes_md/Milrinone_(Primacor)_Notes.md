### Milrinone (Primacor) Pharmacology and Notes

20mg in100ml or 50mg in 250ml= 200mcg/ml**Adult Loading Dose:** IV 50 mcg/kg over 10 min  
  
**Maintenance Infusion:**  
0.375-0.75 mcg/kg/min.  
If poor kidney function: start at 0.2 mcg/kg/min.  
  
**Milrinone (Primacor) Notes:**  
Phosphodiesterase inhibitor.  
Inotrope: increases contractility and cardiac index.  
Potent pulmonary vasodilator.  
Vasodilator.  
Minimal chronotropic effect.  
Decreases capillary wedge pressure.  
Decreases pulmonary artery pressures.  
Enhances relaxation of the left ventricle (lusitropic effect).  
  
**Indications:**  
Short-term treatment of CHF; improves diastolic function in coronary artery bypass surgery.  
  
**Onset of action: Rationale for loading over 10 minutes.**  
  
Begins within several minutes following IV administration. Peak effects occur in about 10 minutes. Effects may last several hours.  
  
**Adverse Effects:**  
Arrhythmias (supraventricular and ventricular)  
Hypotension  
Headache, angina/chest pain  
Hypokalemia  
Thrombocytopenia  
  
Milrinone may increase AV conduction and ventricular response in patients with atrial flutter or fibrillation who have not been digitalized.  
  
**Caution**  
With uncontrolled Afib/Flutter milrinone can enhance AV node conduction. Consider digitalizing these patients first.  
  
**Direct Contraindications:**  
Allergy to any ingredient in milrinone  
Aortic or pulmonic valvular disease  
PVD  
Recent MI  
  
**Primary route of excretion** is via urine.  
  
**Pregnancy** \- Category C. It is not known whether milrinone is harmful to an unborn.
