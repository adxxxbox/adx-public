### Leep (Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure)

**Indication:** Abnormal Pap smear; cervical dysplasia

Most of these procedures can be performed in a doctor’s office. We may get the patients who can’t tolerate the procedure in a doctor’s office.

A very simple and short procedure:  
It is a simple removal of pre-cancerous lesions from the cervix. The LEEP procedure replaces the traditional cone biopsy, shaving the abnormal tissues away. Over 90% of patients are cured in a single treatment.

(LEEP) is used when there are pre-cancerous cells on the surface of the cervix. This does not mean there is cancer, but treatment of the abnormal area is important to prevent the cells from progressing into invasive cervical cancer.

The LEEP is a thin wire loop electrode attached to an electrosurgical generator. The generator transmits a painless electrical current that quickly cuts away the affected cervical tissue—it takes about one minute.

After the lesion is removed, they use a ball electrode to stop any bleeding; the surgeon may also use a topical solution to prevent further bleeding. Biopsies are usually sent to pathology.

  
**Anesthesia:** Similar to a D&C. You could perform a deep MAC or room air general, place an LMA, or even mask them. A spinal is rare for such a simple procedure.  
**Duration:** 10-30 minutes  
**IV Access:** 20 or even a 22G  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**Position:** Lithotomy, slight Trendelenburg.  
**Possible Complications:** Bleeding
