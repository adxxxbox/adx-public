### Factor V Deficiency

**Other names:** Owren’s disease or parahemophilia.  
**Factor V deficiency** shouldn’t be confused with **factor V Leiden mutation.  
**Factor V Deficiency and Factor V Leiden are two totally different illnesses.  
  
**Factor V deficiency** may cause bleeding.  
Factor V (FV) deficiency was first described in a 1943 and reported by a Norwegian hematologist, Dr. Paul Owren in 1947.  
  
**Incidence:** 1 in 1 million; fewer than 200 cases have been documented worldwide.  
**Autosomal recessive:** Inherited; both parents must carry the gene to pass it on to their children. Affects men and women equally.  
  
**Acquired:** Can be acquired by an underlying medical condition, certain medical drugs, or by an autoimmune reaction.  
  
**Causes of acquired factor V deficiency  
**Liver diseases (hepatitis) – Factor V is produced by the liver.  
DIC.  
Fibrinolysis.  
Autoimmune–Lupus, Kawasaki disease and more.  
Some types of cancer.  
The levels of Factor V can drop to only 20% in the blood and still not cause any serious problems.  
**Common Symptoms:** generally mild, some people have no symptoms.  
Nosebleeds (epistaxis).  
Easy bruising.  
Menorrhagia.  
Bleeding in the mouth, particularly after dental surgery or tooth extraction.  
  
_**Other reported symptoms  
**_Bleeding in the gut (gastrointestinal hemorrhage).  
Muscle bleeds.  
Abnormal bleeding during or after injury, surgery or childbirth.  
  
_**Rare symptoms**  
_Bleeding into joints (hemarthrosis).  
Bleeding in the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord).  
Babies with severe FV deficiency are at increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage.  
  
**Lab Test**  
aPTT-prolonged.  
PTT-prolonged.  
  
Thrombin clotting time-prolonged.  
Factor V assay - for final diagnosis.  
  
People with abnormal levels of factor V should also have their factor VIII levels checked to rule out for combined factor V and factor VIII deficiency.  
No concentrates of factor V are commercially available.  
  
**Treatment:**  
Tranexamic acid.  
Desmopressin - nasal spray.  
FFP.  
Platelets - as an alternative.  
Corticosteroids - for acquired deficiency.  
  
**FFP dosing:**  
FFP infusions are used to correct the deficiency temporarily and should be given daily during a bleeding episode.  
The loading dose 15-20 ml/kg and then 3-6 ml/kg daily.  
  
**FFP Dosing:** 15-20 ml/kg is needed to obtain a 20-30% increase in Factor V.  
Subsequent dosages depend on monitoring the factor V level by obtaining peak and trough factor V level assays.  
Postoperatively, FFP should be administered for 3-10 days, with careful observation of wound bleeding.  
  
**Pregnant women and FFP  
**In pregnant women, considerable bleeding can occur at the time of delivery; however, the administration of FFP can properly control bleeding, with excellent fetal outcome.  
  
**Tooth extraction:** In a patient with factor V hereditary deficiency is safely performed with both supplementation of FFP and application of local hemostasis.  
  
**Antifibrinolytic drugs** – Tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid (Amicar) should be administered and continued for the first few days after surgery.  
  
**Desmopressin** – nasal spray pre-op then FFP.  
  
**Platelet transfusions,** which contain factor V, are emerging as an alternative to FFP.  
Factor V is stored within platelet alpha granules and in a bleeding patient, platelet transfusion can be used as an alternative method of delivering factor V.  
  
**Corticosteroids** have been used successfully in acquired factor V deficiency.  
The safe level of factor V for adequate surgical hemostasis is 25% of the activity of factor V in normal control plasma. The half-life ranges from 24-36 hours.
