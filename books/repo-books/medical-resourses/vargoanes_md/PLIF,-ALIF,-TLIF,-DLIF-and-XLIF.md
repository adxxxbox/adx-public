**DLIF-Direct Lateral Interbody Fusion, Minimally Invasive:**

Patient is positioned laterally. This is just another minimally invasive back procedure except it’s performed in the lateral position. A C-arm or Medtronic O-arm is used to determine the location of the operative site.

**PLIF-Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion:** 

The most popular position for all spine procedures is prone.

**XLIF-Extreme Lateral Interbody Fusion:** 

A gentle, less invasive spinal fusion alternative for patients whose spinal condition requires a fusion to be performed.

**ALIF-Anterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion:**

Anterior approach, supine or slightly lateral position. An anterior approach provides for a much more comprehensive evacuation of the disc space and this leads to increase surface area available for a fusion. A larger spinal implant can be inserted from an anterior approach, which provides for superior stabilization. In cases of spinal deformity like isthmic spondylolisthesis, a posterior approach alone is more difficult to reduce the deformity.

 **TLIF-Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion:**

TLIF back surgery is done through the posterior part of the spine. It’s basically a spinal fusion of the lumbar. Done in the prone position.
