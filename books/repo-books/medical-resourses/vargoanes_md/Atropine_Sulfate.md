### Atropine Sulfate

A natural tertiary amine extracted from belladonna alkaloid.The anticholinergic drug of choice to increase the HR.  
**  
Classes:**  
Anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) for cardiac conditions  
Belladonna and derivative gastrointestinal antispasmodics  
Mydriatics and cycloplegics  
**MOA:** Inhibits postganglionic muscarinic receptors, thus competes with acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptor sites as an antagonist.  
A competitive antagonist, thus its effects can eventually be overcome by an increasing concentration of acetylcholine.  
  
**It increases the firing of the sinoatrial node (atria)** and conduction through the atrioventricular node (AV) of the heart by blocking the action of the vagus nerve.  
  
Does not affect nicotinic receptors.  
Atropine may cause mild sedation (CNS) and has weak antisialagogue effects than does scopolamine.  
**  
Indications:  
**Drug of choice for symptomatic bradycardia (most efficacious anticholinergic for bradyarrhythmias)  
**Peds:** To block vagal cardiac reflexes and/or succinylcholine-induced bradyarrhythmias.  
Co-administered with edrophonium to counter the onset of bradycardia during the reversal of neuromuscular blockade.  
Antidote for anticholinesterase poisoning  
  
**Treatment for** **hiccups (off-label)  
**There are reports of the successful use of atropine, 0.5 mg IV 1, for treatment of hiccups after LMA insertion.  
  
**Atropine is no longer a treatment of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) or asystole**  
The AHA has removed atropine from the cardiac arrest guidelines for the treatment of pulseless  
electrical activity (PEA) or asystole because there is no evidence of its therapeutic benefit.  
  
**Effects:**  
Increases HR, CO via blockade of vagal inhibitory impulses to SA /AV nodes.  
Decreases secretions of exocrine glands (weak antisialagogue as compared to glycopyrrolate)  
Decreases smooth muscle tone and motility (decreases lower esophageal sphincter pressure)  
Modest Anti-spasmodic Action: Decreases smooth muscle tone of the biliary tract and ureter.  
However, it is not potent enough to overcome the opioid-induced spasm of the sphincter of oddi.  
Decreases cholinergic over activity in CNS  
Mydriasis (pupil dilation) and cycloplegia  
  
**Cycloplegia:** Paralysis of the ciliary muscle of the eye, resulting in a loss of accommodation.  
Increases IOP  
  
**Adult Doses:**  
**Symptomatic bradycardia  
**0.5 mg IV  
This may be repeated every 3 to 5 minutes up to 3 mg or 6 _doses.  
  
**For mild symptomatic bradycardia refractory to**_ **glycopyrrolate  
**Some anesthesia providers administer a reduced dose, as little as 0.1 mg of atropine to increase the heart rate enough to correct bradycardia without inducing tachycardia.  
_NOTE: There is some evidence that subtherapeutic doses of atropine can have a paradoxical effect and reduce heart rate._  
  
**Adult dose for intratracheal administration** is 1 to 2 mg. (Dilute in no more than 10 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride injection or sterile water for injection).  
To prevent bradycardia with edrophonium, simultaneously administer atropine 7mcg/kg.  
  
**Pediatric Doses  
Indication:** Symptomatic bradycardia  
**IV:** 0.02 mg/kg  
**Intramuscular (IM):** 0.02 to 0.04 mg/kg  
**Intratracheal:** 0.02 to 0.04 mg/kg (follow the dose with or dilute in saline flush (1 to 5 mL) based on patient size)  
**Maximum single dose** (this dose may be repeated once):**Child:** 0.5 mg  
**Adolescent:** 1.0 mg  
  
**To block cardiovagal reflexes and/or succinylcholine-induced bradycardia  
IV dose:** 0.02 mg/kg  
**IM dose:** 0.02 to 0.04 mg/kg IM just before or simultaneously with succinylcholine.  
**Note:** Some pediatric anesthesia specialist will alternatively utilize a standard dose of 0.2 mg IV regardless of the patient’s weight.**Tertiary amines vs quaternary amines  
Tertiary amines (lipophilic):** atropine and scopolamine cross the blood- brain barrier and therefore affect the central nervous system (CNS) in addition to other organ systems.  
An overdose can result in anticholinergic syndrome, which may result in disorientation, hyperthermia, tachycardia, and/or coma.**Quaternary amines (hydrophilic):** Glycopyrrolate does not cross the blood-brain barrier, thus has little CNS penetration and associated side effects.  
**Anticholinesterase pesticide poisoning (** may require large doses of atropine or the addition of pralidoxime)**Goal** is to reverse excessive secretions, miosis, bronchospasm, vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis, and urinary incontinence.  
**Adult IV doses:** Begin with boluses of 1–5 mg  
**Peds IV doses:** 0.05 mg/kg up to adult doses depending on the severity of symptoms.  
Repeat doses of 1–2 mg should be given every 2–3 minutes or more rapidly until stabilization occurs.  
A reduction in pulmonary secretions is the primary target of atropine therapy.  
Large cumulative doses of atropine may be required.  
Tachycardia is NOT a contraindication to atropine therapy.  
**Isolated pulmonary** **manifestations** may respond to nebulized atropine or ipratropium (Atrovent®).  
  
**If atropine-induced antimuscarinic CNS toxicity is present**  
In the presence of atropine-induced antimuscarinic CNS toxicity and peripheral cholinergic findings necessitate the administration of more atropine,  
glycopyrrolate bromide can be substituted for atropine because its quaternary structure limits CNS penetration.  
  
**Use** **cautiously in patients with:**  
Narrow-angle glaucoma  
Prostatic hypertrophy  
Bladder-neck obstruction  
  
**Atropine in the presence of myocardial ischemia and hypoxia:**  
**The increased HR will cause:**  
Increased myocardial oxygen demand.  
Reduced diastolic filling time, thus decreasing coronary perfusion and worsening ischemia.  
  
**It is not effective for:  
**Mobitz II (second-degree block type II)  
Complete heart block (third-degree block)  
  
**Atropine for third-degree block**  
Third-degree block is a complete disassociation of the atria from the ventricles.  
Third-degree block is a complete dissociation of the atria from the ventricles.  
Atropine’s effect is primarily on the SA node in the atria; a 3rd-degree block would prevent its effect on the SA node from influencing the rate of ventricular contraction which is needed to improve perfusion.  
In most cases, atropine will not hurt the patient with 3rd-degree block unless they are unstable and cardiac pacing is delayed in order to administer atropine.  
**In Mobitz II (second-degree AV block type II),** the situation is similar. There is a partial block of the electrical impulses from the atria (SA) to the ventricles, and thus the effects of atropine would not significantly change the status of the ventricles.  
This block can rapidly progress to 3rd-degree block.  
  
**Bronchodilator ipratropium bromide**  
Solution (0.5 mg in 2.5 ml) is a derivative of atropine.  
Can be administered via metered dose inhaler (MDI) or nebulized for treatment of bronchospasm.  
More effective when alternated with albuterol in acute COPD patients.
