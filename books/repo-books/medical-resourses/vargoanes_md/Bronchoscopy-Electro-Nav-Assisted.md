### Bronchoscopy- Electromagnetic Navigation Assisted

  
This is just a very long bronchoscopy that we intubate and relax the patient to keep it simple. This is an advanced type of bronchoscopy that maneuvers deeper into the segmental bronchi that a regular bronchoscopy can’t; and biopsies of pulmonary nodules as small as 6mm can be taken. It uses a navigation GPS type device that guides the doctor to a targeted nodule or lymph nodes.  
Prior to the procedure, CT scan images are uploaded up and reconstructed into a 3 dimensional view. It has a GPS device that actually tells the doctor to go left or right to get to their target.  
The bronchoscopy tube is inserted down as far as it will go. When it can’t advance anymore, a thin catheter is inserted through the bronchoscopy tube with claws or a needle, and is guided peripherally to the target. This skinny catheter can maneuver just like the bronchoscope.  
It can also biopsy tracheal lymph nodes that are sitting externally on the trachea wall.  Using a thin needle, it can atraumatically penetrate the trachea wall and aspirate lymph tissue for a biopsy.

**General: ETT**: Use as large an ETT as possible.  
**LTA Kit:** Consider it, because it can decrease coughing.  

**ETT Sizes:**  
Warning: an 8.0mm ETT is too small for this procedure.  
An 8.5mm ETT is a pretty tight fit for the Navigation tube to slide through.  
A 9.0mm ETT is strongly recommended.  
Have a pair of scissors handy because you will need to shorten the ETT. This is best done before the ETT is placed in the patient.

Many times a 9.0mm or 8.5mm ETT is too large to pass through the cords, so don’t force it.

**Using an LMA**  
An LMA is commonly used when the patient’s glottis is too narrow for an 8.5 ETT, or  
when the upper paratracheal nodes are the target. Unfortunately, an ETT passes the cords and obstructs access to the upper paratracheal nodes. Make sure the LMA has an adequate seal.  

However, it is usually more difficult to ventilate the patient with an LMA during a bronchoscopy. Much more difficult.

**LMA NOTE:** You will need to remove (cut) the vinyl bars at the junction of the tube and

the laryngeal mask so the navigation scope could slide through the LMA.

**Duration:** 1-2 hours

**Relaxant:** Succinylcholine or an intermediate lasting NDMR. If you are not keeping the patient relaxed, you better give a deep anesthetic and Neosynephrine drip for pressure support.  
**Propofol infusion:** Not needed if you are using a muscle relaxant with an inhalation agent.  
**Narcotics:** Keep to a minimum because sometimes these could be pretty quick cases.  

**Bronchoscope Swivel Adapter:** Make sure you have one prior to the procedure. Most of the time they are with the bronchoscopy cart. It looks like your ventilator elbow connector except it has a small port with a removable rubber cap on top of it. While the patient is being ventilated, the bronchoscope can be inserted through the port (when cap is removed) without disconnecting the ventilator. This allows the bronchoscope access to the airway while maintaining ventilation, oxygenation, and PEEP. However, you still may have to manually ventilate due to desaturations or loss of positive pressure due to air leaking out around the bronchoscope. The best anesthetics are when you are able to bring the patient back to spontaneous respirations while the bronchoscopy is going on. If you have used an LTA kit or sprayed the cords with plain lidocaine, you have a good chance of doing that as long as you haven’t blunted the respiratory drive with lots of opioids. And if your facility doesn’t have LTA kits, make your own. Using a 10 cc syringe, drawn up 6-7 ccs of plain 1-2% lidocaine WITHOUT EPI. Attach a 20 gauge IV without the metal stylet to the luer tip of the syringe and have at it. You have created your own LTA.   

**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.

**The main risks from bronchoscopy:**  
Bleeding from biopsy sites.  
Infection  
Laryngospasms (MAC case).

**There is also a small risk of:**  
Arrhythmias  
Breathing difficulties  
Fever  
Heart attack in people with existing heart disease  
Low blood oxygen  
Pneumothorax  
Sore throat
