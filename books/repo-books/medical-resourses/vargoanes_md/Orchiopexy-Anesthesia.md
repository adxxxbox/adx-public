## Orchiopexy Anesthesia

(Undescended Testicle Repair) Anesthesia  
**_Edited by Anna Stone, CRNA_**

Orchiopexy corrects the placement of a testicle that has not dropped from the groin into the scrotum.  
Anesthesia is similar to inguinal hernia repair – caudal epidural plus general with laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is a popular technique.

Cryptorchidism is the absence of one or both testes in the scrotum. This condition affects 0.8% of 1-year-old boys.

The undescended testicle may be within the abdomen, the inguinal canal or the external ring located proximal to the scrotum.

Surgical correction is usually performed on babies between 9-15 months of age by a pediatric urologist. Also may be performed on older boys and, rarely, on teens or adults.

A patient with an undescended testicle has a 10-fold risk of a malignancy compared to a patient whose descended normally. This condition is also often associated with the presence of an inguinal hernia.

The surgical approach depends on location of the testicle. One or two small incisions are made in the scrotum, the groin, or the abdomen to allow the surgeon to reach the testicle and move it to the scrotum. Laparoscopy may be performed to move undescended testicles when they are located high in the inguinal canal or in the abdomen.

Two procedures several months apart may be required when testicles are located in the abdomen.

**Anesthesia:** General with endotracheal tube (ETT) or LMA. LMA preferred unless contraindicated.

**Caudal Block:** Common for non-ambulatory infants, but walking ability does not contraindicate placement.

**_A common cut off for caudal is whether parent is comfortable carrying child or 20kg. For block use 0.2% Ropivacaine 1cc/kg with max of 20cc._**

**Ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric block-** Infants and neonates have a HIGH failure rate with this block, therefore it is rarely performed. An LMA can be used if the hernia is not thought to be incarcerated.

**Note:** When using an LMA without a caudal block, should keep the patient deep. When the spermatic cord is being manipulated, a laryngospasm or bradycardia can occur if the patient is light.

**_It is prudent to keep patients deep for beginning of procedure in case of failure of caudal. This is a prime laryngospasm time if caudal is not working and gas has been decreased._**

**Narcotics:** Minimal to none are required when a caudal block is present, but 0.5-1 mcg/kg fentanyl may smooth wakeup.

**Position:** Supine. The patient may be temporarily moved to the lateral position after the airway is secured for a caudal block. The Infant may be repositioned towards the foot of the bed. Protect the airway and ensure circuit is of sufficient length.

**IV Access** : 24g or 22g is adequate. Saphenous placement is less painful for the child.

**Hydration:** 4:2:1

**(below is just a common reference)**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc/kg)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**Duration:** 30-60 minutes

**EBL:** Minimal

**Synthetic Patch-** not inserted with infants.

**Possible Complications  
Vagal Bradycardia** : Pulling on the genitals can cause a vagal bradycardia. You should have Atropine and Robinul readily available. Alert the surgeon if there is a bradycardic episode so he/she could stop manipulating the genitals.

Infection  
Bleeding  
Damage to the vas deferens
