# Dilaudid (Hydromorphone)

  
**Class:** Opiate receptor agonist  
A semi-synthetic potent narcotic that is approximately 5-8 times more potent on a milligram basis than Morphine.  
The narcotic of choice for chronic pain patients and cases known to involve severe post op pain ex- open abdominal, thoracic and back cases.  
Very popular in recovery room because of it's duration.  
**Dose:** We usually give 0.5-1mg/hr IVP Q 1h  
0.5-2mg Q4-6h  
**Peds:** 0.005-0.02mg/kg  
**On emergence:** Titrate 0.5-1mg with maintaining spontaneous RR >10 bpm with normal ETCO2.  
Some anesthesia providers administer 2mg IV in holding area and do not use any narcotic with induction.  
Comes in a small vial of 1-2mLs. Most CRNAs dilute it.  
It has a shorter duration than Morphine.  
**Onset (Peak):** 2-5minutes  
**Duration:** 2-4 hours  
**In surgery:** Titrate to effect.  
Crosses Placenta like other narcotics  
Can delay gastric emptying  
Can have chest wall rigidity with large dose like other narcotics.  
**Nausea:** less than morphine.  
It interacts with mostly Mu and some Kappa receptors.  
  
Hydromorphone was first synthesized and researched in Germany in 1924. Dilaudid is basically a synthetic form of Morphine hence its generic name hydromorphone and most emergency rooms prefer Dilaudid over Morphine.  
  
It is eight times stronger than morphine and about three to five times stronger than heroin on a milligram basis.

**Indications:** For the relief of moderate-to-severe pain in opioid-tolerant patients who require larger than usual doses of opioids to provide adequate pain relief.  
  
Dilaudid is also preferred over Morphine due to the fact it has a lot less side effects than Morphine. It displays superior solubility and speed of onset, a less troublesome side effect profile, and lower dependence liability as compared to morphine.

**Mechanism of Action:** Primarily a mu agaonists.

  
Should not be administered to patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, especially paralytic ileus, because it diminishes the propulsive peristaltic wave in the in the GI Tract and may prolong the obstruction.

**_Distribution:_**  
At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8-19% bound to plasma proteins.

* * *

**_Metabolism:_**  
Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver which is excreted in urine.  
In most people, the liver produces hydromorphone when processing hydrocodone using the cytochrome p450 II-D-6 enzyme pathway.

* * *

**_Elimination:_**  
Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.  
Elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours.

* * *

**_Pregnancy and Nursing Mothers:_**  
Hydromorphone crosses the placenta. Hydromorphone is also found in low levels in breast milk No teratogenicity or embryotoxicity were observed  
  
**Contra-Indications:** Intracranial lesion associated with increased intracranial pressure, status asthmaticus, pulmonary edema.

**Precautions:** May be habit-forming.

* * *

**Avoid with MAO inhibitors:** (e.g., furazolidone, isocarboxazid, linezolid, moclobemide, phenelzine, procarbazine, rasagiline, selegiline, tranylcypromine) within 2 weeks before, during, or after treatment with Dilaudid.
