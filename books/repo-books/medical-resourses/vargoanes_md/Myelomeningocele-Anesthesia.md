Myelomeningocele (MMC) Anesthesia   

### Myelomeningocele (MMC) Anesthesia

Despite aggressive surgical and medical management, 15-30% of neonates with MMC die within the first 5 year of life. The majority of deaths are attributed to severe Chiari malformation (CM) II.

When born with a Myelomeningocele, a surgical repair should be performed within the first few days of life. The greater the delay of repair, the greater risks of ventriculitis and motor dysfunction.

The neonate will immediately be assessed for associated anomalies.  
(listed in **Myelomeningocele (spina bifida cystica) Review)**

  
These children will usually need multiple surgeries over the course of their lives, thus latex precautions should be initiated.  
Virtually all patients are considered latex allergic.

**Goals of Myelomeningocele (MMC) Repair:**

The goals of surgery are to protect the neural elements, to remove excess skin tissue, and to obtain a watertight dural closure to prevent infection without exacerbating neurological deficits.

Children with associated Chiari malformation and/or hydrocephalus need special attention during the perioperative period.

High thoracic defects will result in a severe neurological deficit.

Surgical repair of MMC may, at times, pose life-threatening complications mostly because of associated anomalies.

**Surgical Procedure:**

After intubation, the baby is placed prone on the operating table with the head slightly lower than the back so that the cerebrospinal fluid will not be replaced by air.

The incision is carried down, and often into the meningeal sac, initially in an area free of neural elements.

The skin edges are retracted laterally. In the wall of the sac, nerve roots that course back into the spinal canal are mobilized. Some neural elements can be atretic and terminate in the sac itself and may be sacrificed.

The edges of the neural placode are then folded and sutured in attempt to maintain the configuration of the spinal cord. Within the spinal canal, the filum terminale can often be identified. It should be cut sharply to release the associated tethering of the spinal cord.

The dura is then dissected from the subcutaneous tissue and lumbosacral fascia A watertight closure is essential and can be verified with a valsalva maneuver given by anesthesia.

Placement of small subcutaneous drains are sometimes applied aiding in preventing seromas that could be confused with CSF.

**Is this procedure combined with a VP shunt for Hydrocephalus**

Patients with a large hydrocephalus may have a VP Shunt inserted in the supine position following MMC repair in prone position.

Postoperative ventilation was required in 8.9% of children, primarily due to inadequate reversal from neuromuscular blockade.

**Pre op assessment**

Besides your basic pre-evaulation, you should also for the following:

CSF leak from the sac  
Neurological presentation  
Associated systemic abnormalities  
Read their MRI and CT Scan reports in relevance to the extent of disease.

  
Anectine is not associated with hyperkalemia with these patents  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT**Airway issues:** usually not.**Regional:** N/A  
**Induction position:** In lateral position or supine. Some prefer lateral for a large MMC.  
**Induction:** Usually IV  
**Intubation:** Careful with patients with diagnosed Chiari Malformation  
**Nitrous: +/-  
Muscle Relaxation: +/-  
Position** : This is possibly the most important consideration when preparing for an anesthetic for the kids with a myelomeningocele. It is very important to ensure there is no direct pressure applied to the exposed neural placode while supine for induction and intubation. Putting the placode within the padding made in the shape of a doughnut can be done. Sometimes a sort of platform is constructed raising the child and allowing the meningocele to sit below without pressure. However, also avoid allowing the sac to “hang”. Overall, avoid direct pressure/compression and/or unnecessary weight pulling upon the sac.

After intubation, the baby is placed prone on the operating table with the head slightly lower to reduce chance of an air embolism into the dural space. Some patients with large hydrocephalus requiring a VP Shunt will have surgical insertion in supine position immediately following MMC repair.

**Duration:** Very dependent on size and position of MMC, as well as surgeon skill. Appx 2+ hours is a good estimate.  
**EBL:** 20 ml- 130 ml**Blood Bolus dose:** 10-20cc/kg if needed.  
**IV Access:** Will already have one. Flush and assess preoperatively.**  
Hydration: 4:2:1 (below is just a common reference)  
**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
3rd Spacing: 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  

**A-line:** Although it may not be specifically necessary for blood loss/fluid shift reasons, these pt’s are neonates—small bodies, big surgical area—and precise control of anesthetic is important and therefore indicates areterial monitoring

**Age Range: Premie or neonate  
  
**

**Foley Catheter:  
**  
**Emergence:** depending on the pt’s other complicating comorbities (such as a hydrocephalus), overall health status, and complexity of repair; post op intubation is a consideration but not necessarily a standard requirement. In the case of a long surgery, watch for facial and airway edema secondary to positioning and consider remaining intubated post op.
