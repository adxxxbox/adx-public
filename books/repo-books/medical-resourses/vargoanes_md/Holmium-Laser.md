### Holmium Laser

Whenever you have a procedure that has a “Homium Laser” listed, you know that the surgeon will almost always require NO MOVEMENT!  
This means General/ETT with muscle relaxation or a Spinal.  
**_If the patient coughs, the unexpected movement could cause dire consequences._**

The Holmium laser, which operates at a wavelength of 2.1 microns, is highly absorbed by water and has a shallow penetration depth of approximately 0.4 mm. The shallow penetration depth minimizes the coagulation zone and collateral damage to sensitive surrounding tissue for clean and precise incision and tissue vaporization (also called ablation). Hemostasis is achieved by lasing 2-3 mm away from the tissue (defocusing technique). When working in a liquid environment, most of the energy is absorbed in the surrounding water and thereby reduces the energy that can reach the non-target tissue, contributing to the safety of the procedure.

**The Holmium lasers are cleared for procedures in multiple specialties, including:**  
Urology,  
Gastroenterology  
Pulmonology  
Orthopedics

**Safety Glasses**  
What ever nurse, Tech or Rep who is setting up the laser will provide you with two pairs of safety glasses for eye protection (for you and the patient).  The glasses protect the eyes against harmful laser radiation from Holmium, Yag and CO2 lasers. Properly wearing laser safety glasses is not only a crucial safety component; it is a requirement in all medical facilities where medical laser procedures are performed. Wearing the glasses is to be compliant with ANSI Z136.3 standards, intended for individuals working
