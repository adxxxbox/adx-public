### Vasospasms after a Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)

Cerebral vasospasm is one of the most dreaded consequences of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm. A vasospasm typically develops around 3 to 10 days after the initial SAH, usually from an aneurysm rupture. So the safest time to clip the aneurysm or surgically fix the problem is before day 3 or after day 10.

Patients with an SAH are usually kept in the ICU for up to two weeks following the initial hemorrhage in order to watch closely for early signs of vasospasm-related complications.

Vasospasm is a leading cause of death or disability after subarachnoid hemorrhage.     
  
It can be localized or involve several intracranial arteries. 

After a cerebral aneurysm clipping, regardless of the patients clinical status, there is a 50% risk of a cerebral vasospasm.

It is a causative factor in 28% of all deaths and 39% of all disability after SAH.  
It occurs in approximately 70% of persons with ruptured aneurysms and produces symptoms in 20-30%.  
  
**Cause of Vasospasms**  
After a head bleed, blood clots and adhesions hinder the free spread of blood through the subarachnoid space, supporting the formation of intra-cerebral hematomas. The blood and its breakdown products in the subarachnoid space irritate the muscular walls of the nearby arteries and likely contribute to the etiology of cerebral vasospasm. Cerebral ischemia, stroke and death may follow.

  
**Complications of Cerebral Vasospasms**  
Cerebral vasospasm is the most common cause of stroke and death in patients who are hospitalized after a SAH. If untreated, death or significant disability occurs in more than 20% of patients.

**Vasospasm Symptoms:**  
A decreased LOC > 3 days after initial SAH.  
New focal neurologic deficits >3 days after the initial SAH.  
Increased headache, meningismus, and fever.  
  
The neurosurgeon needs to rule out the other possible causes that can occur after an initial SAH, including re-bleeding, hydrocephalus, subdural hematoma, cerebral infarction and edema. 

**Prevention and Treament of Cerebral Vasospasm:**

**Nimodipine (Nimotop) and Nicardipine**  
Both of these 2 drugs are Calcium Channel Blockers. Literature reports that if a patient is  on one or both of these drugs, there may be severe hypotension after induction. This is very rare.  
**Nicardipine:** reduces the clinical incidence of vasospasm.  
**Nimodipine (Nimotop):** is a powerful cerebral vasodilator and has proved in several studies to produce a significant improvement after SAH.   
 

**“Triple H Therapy”**   
Triple H therapy has been shown to reverse ischemic neurological deficits associated with vasospasm in up to 70% of patients. If a patient’s neurological status starts to decline, and there is no contraindication, the surgeon may initiate the “Triple H” therapy.  
 

**Triple H  
Hypertension:** Medically induced from one of the basic pressor drips is common.  
If the aneurysm is already clipped, the goal is to maintain the BP between 160-200 systolic. If the aneurysm has not been clipped, the target is a systolic of 120-150 to prevent aneurysm rupture while maintaining CPP.  
**Hypervolemia:** The goal is to provide volume to the brain; keep the CVP at 10-15mmHg, PAP at 15-18mm H2O, CI at 3-3.5 l/m.  
**Hemodilution:** Dilute to an HCT around 30-35%.

**Complications of “Triple H”:**  
Pulmonary edema  
Myocardial ischemia  
Rebleeding  
Rupture of new aneurysm  
Vasogenic edema/hemorrhagic infarction in setting of compromised Blood-Brain Barrier.  
Death

**Other Treatments for Vasospasms**  
Thrombolytic agents (e.g., urokinase)  
Removal of subarachnoid blood as soon as possible.  
Anti-inflammatory agents (steroids or NSAIDs).  
Endovascular dilation.
