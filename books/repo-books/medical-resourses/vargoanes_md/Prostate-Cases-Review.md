### Prostate Cases-Review

**Prostatectomy Simple vs. Radical**  
**Simple:** A prostatectomy for benign disease (BPH) involves removal of only the inner portion of the prostate.

**Radical:** Removal of the entire prostate, the seminal vesicles, and the vas deferens due to cancer.

**Prostate BrachyTherapy:**   
Placing radioactive seeds in the prostate-under ultra sound for Prostate CA. There will be 2 doctors- a radiation oncologist and urologist. Lithotomy and almost always an ETT with relaxation necessary.

**TURP: Transurethral Resection of the Prostate**  
A surgical instrument (resectoscope) is inserted through the urethra to trim away excess prostate tissue that's blocking urine flow. The resectoscope is for bladder fulguration.  
Done in Lithotomy; use of an LMA or ETT or spinal is standard. Check with surgeon.  
   
  
**Different Approaches to the Prostate Gland**

**Prostatectomy, Retropubic:** Avoids entry into the bladder and allows good visualization of the field. Incision is between the umbilicus and the top of the pubic bone (well below the belt-line). The prostate is removed from the urethra below and the bladder above, and the bladder and urethra are reconnected. The blood vessels leading to and from the prostate are then divided and tied off.  
  
**Prostatectomy**, **Radical Retropubic:** Is typically for early stage prostate cancer. Early stage prostate cancer is confined to the prostate gland and has not yet spread beyond the prostate or to other parts of the body.

**Prostatectomy, Suprapubic:** Is similar to retropubic approach, except a cut is made through the bladder.    
  
**Prostatectomy Perineal:** An incision is made in the perineum, midway between the rectum and scrotum through which the prostate is removed The patient is in an exaggerated lithotomy. Legs are back with the knees touching the chest with mild reverse Trendelenburg. Pressure control ventilation is usually required.

**Cryosurgery: Ablation of the Prostate Gland**  
Transrectal approach in Lithotomy position. ETT with relaxation is required.  
Can’t start the procedure without the Rep who brings the Argon laser and other equipment.

**DaVinci Robotic Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy:**   
Steep Trendelenburg and we used to keep the patient dry until the end of the case-Check with the surgeon. Protect the eyes with Goggles. Arms tucked. General/ETT.

**Prostate Biopsy, Transrectal Ultrasonically Guided:**  
Left lateral, General with a Propofol infusion. This case is usually done on the patient’s stretcher. A very quick case.  

**Prostate Green light Procedure:**    
For BPH. Similar to a TURP procedure, except a laser is used.  Compared to a TURP procedure, the Green light procedure it is associated with fewer side effects, shorter periods of catheterization, quicker recovery, and no need for post-op hospitalization.   
General/ETT with relaxation or a spinal.
