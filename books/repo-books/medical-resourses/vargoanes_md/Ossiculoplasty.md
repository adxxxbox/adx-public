### Ossiculoplasty (Ossicular Chain Reconstruction)

**Goal:** To reestablish the connection between the intact tympanic membrane and the oval window.

Also called **“Middle Ear Bone Surgery.”** It can improve conductive hearing and  replace a damaged malleus or incus bone. This procedure is often done along with a tympanoplasty or a mastoidectomy. An incision can be made behind the ear and the ear is reflected forward or through the external ear canal. The surgeon will make the initial assessment by going through the external ear canal and observe the mobility of the Ossicular Chain. The ear bones (ossicles) will be shaped or replaced, and the incision is closed. The ear is then packed.  
 

**Anesthetic**: General/ETT or LMA  
**Positioning:** Supine; head turned away with ipsilateral arm tucked.

**Muscle Relaxation:** Depends on facial nerve monitoring.  
**Duration:** 1.5 - 4 hours; depends on the surgeon.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
**Facial Nerve Monitoring:** Probably; check with the surgeon.  
**Emergence:** Smooth  
Consider PONV meds
