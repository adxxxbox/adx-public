### Propofol (Diprivan)

**Chemical Name:** 2,6-diisopropylphenol  
**Brand Names:** Diprivan®, Fresenius™ Propoven®  
**Chemical name:** 2,6-diisopropylphenol  
An induction agent  
  
\- Propofol is a potent and widely used intravenous hypnotic drug used in anesthesiology and intensive care.  
\- Propofol is the most commonly used adult anesthesia induction agent.  
  
**History:**  
\- Propofol was developed by Imperial Chemical Industries Limited (London, UK).  
\- It was patented by John (Iain) Glen and Roger James in 1977.  
\- It was commercially launched in 1986 in Europe and in 1989 in the US.  
  
For Pharmacokinetics of propofol, refer to _“Propofol (Diprivan) Pharmacokinetics and Chemistry”_ in this app.  
  
**Administration route:** IV only  
**Concentration:** 10 mg/mL  
  
**Pharmaceutical class:  
**\- IV anesthetic, sedative and hypnotic  
\- It also has anticonvulsant and amnestic properties.  
\- Propofol has NO analgesic or muscle relaxant effects.  
  
**Possible indications for propofol:**  
\- Induction or maintenance of anesthesia, patients ≥ 3 years of age.  
\- An adjunct when the patient becomes light during general anesthesia, patients ≥ 2 months of age.  
\- A sole or balanced technique (TIVA), adults only  
\- Conscious/sedation under MAC, adults only  
\- Postoperative anti-emetic (10-15 mg) for nausea.  
\- Bronchodilation (may attenuate intraoperative bronchospasm)  
\- Antipruritic  
\- To temporarily treat acute intraoperative hypertension, adults only  
\- Prior to local injection for MAC cases  
\- Prior to the application of halo pin tightening (craniotomy)  
\- Orthopedics for joint manipulation  
\- Cardioversions/TEE  
\- GI procedures (EGD/colonoscopy)  
  
**Dose-dependent cardiovascular and respiratory suppression:**  
**At therapeutic or anesthetic doses, it depresses the activity of the medullary respiratory and vasomotor centers resulting in:**  
\- Respiratory depression  
\- Vasodilation (decreases SVR)  
\- Myocardial depression  
**Mechanism of action:** GABA  
\- The action of propofol involves a positive modulation of the inhibitory function of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) through GABA-A receptors.  
\- The modulation of GABA receptors⟶ ↑ transmembrane Cl conduction⟶ hyperpolarizes post synaptic cell membrane ⟶ inhibition of the post synaptic neuron, increasing the duration of the opening of the chloride channels.  
\- This prolongs hyperpolarization and thus creates sedative and hypnotic effects.  
  
**Equivalent doses of 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg IV propofol:**  
Thiopental, 4-5 mg/kg IV  
Methohexital, 1.5 mg/kg IV  
  
**Propofol dosing:** table.tableizer-table { font-size: 12px; border: 1px solid #CCC; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; } .tableizer-table td { padding: 4px; margin: 3px; border: 1px solid #CCC; } .tableizer-table th { background-color: #104E8B; color: #FFF; font-weight: bold; }

| Indication | Dose |
| --- | --- |
| **Induction (adults)** | 1-3 mg/kg |
| **Induction (elderly)** | 1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg  
Due to a smaller volume of distribution and slower clearance. |
| **Induction Peds** | 2.5-3.5 mg/kg |
| **Antiemetic** | 10-15 mg IV (sub-hypnotic)  
It can treat PONV in the PACU. |
| **Antipruritic** | 10 mg IV can be used to treat pruritus associated with neuraxial opioids. |
| **Anticonvulsant** | Doses > 1mg/kg will decrease ECT-induced seizure duration 30-45%. |
| **Conscious sedation (infusion)** | 25-100 mcg/kg  
Produce little amnestic effect |
| **Maintenance of General  
Anesthesia (TIVA)** | 100-300 mcg/kg/min  
**Context-sensitive half-time** is less than 40 minutes after an 8-hour infusion. |
| **To suppress Photic sneeze reflex** | Low dose during a retrobulbar block.  
Minimal literature for to suppressing Photic sneeze reflex |

**  
The administration of propofol often burns at the IV site.  
**\- Most propofol formulations cause pain on injection, which is thought to be due to direct and indirect irritation of venous adventitia by free aqueous propofol through interaction with TRPV1 and TRPA1 receptors.  
\- It often burns more when infused into small dorsum hand veins versus a more prominent, more proximal vein.  
**Methods to decrease IV burning with propofol:  
Location of IV site:** A more prominent arm vein is preferred over a small hand vein.\- Pain on injection has been observed to be decreased by preceding the induction dose with a 50 mg injection of lidocaine.  
\- Lidocaine also offers an additional advantage of partially blunting the stimulation of direct laryngoscopy and intubation.  
\- The lidocaine injection may be given along with the simultaneous proximal manual compression (per available hand squeezing) of the extremity to sequester the lidocaine in the vein; thus, it may function as a temporary “mini Bier block.”  
\- This may decrease the pain on injection.  
  
**Rapid onset of propofol:** < 1 minute (with normal cardiac output)\- The rapid onset is due to high lipid solubility.  
\- 1.5-2.5 mg/kg will produce unconsciousness within 30 seconds.  
  
**Propofol has antiemetic properties:  
**\- 10-15 mg IV of propofol can be used to treat PONV, mainly if it is not of vagal origin.  
\- The low dose is subhypnotic and safe in the postoperative area.**  
  
_Antipruritic Effects:  
_**10 mg IV propofol is an effective treatment of pruritus (itching) associated with neuraxial opioids or cholestasis.  
**  
Propofol is an anticonvulsant:  
**A propofol dose of greater than 1 mg/kg IV decreases seizure duration by 35% to 45% of patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy.  
**  
_Propofol may cause bronchospasm when it contains_ metabisulfite.  
**\- Normally propofol attenuates bronchospasm and is safe to use with hypersensitive airways.  
\- However, a newer formulation of propofol uses metabisulfite as a preservative.  
\- Metabisulfite may cause bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients.  
**Propofol is amnestic:  
**\- A low dose of propofol has been shown to induce amnesia without any impairments in behavior.  
\- The mechanism for amnesia is unknown.  
  
**Propofol and PONV:  
**\- Patients who receive anesthesia with propofol will typically experience significantly less PONV than those associated with other hypnotic drugs and opiates.  
\- TIVA with propofol is becoming more popular in patients with a history of PONV (avoiding inhalation agents.  
\- The mechanisms are unknown.  
  
**Propofol and effects on organ systems:  
Neurophysiological Effects: (Brain/CNS)**  
\- The favorable effects on cerebral physiology make propofol an almost ideal hypnotic for anesthesia during neurosurgery.  
\- Propofol decreases CMRO2, cerebral blood flow, and ICP while maintaining dynamic and static autoregulation of CO2.  
\- Propofol boluses may be administered to decrease sudden elevations in ICP during craniotomies.  
\- However, the evidence for neuroprotective effects of propofol during ischemia-reperfusion injury is conflicting.  
\- In craniotomies, 50-100 mg dose is often administered prior to stimulating procedures such as the tightening of the Mayfield pins**  
  
Evoked Potentials:**  
Cortical response to somatosensory evoked potential stimuli displays little change under propofol alone, but in combination with nitrous oxide, there is a noticeable decrease in amplitude.  
**  
Amnesia:**  
\- Propofol and midazolam have similar sedative effects both immediately after bolus doses and after 1 hour of continuous infusions of the drugs.  
\- In contrast, midazolam had a more profound amnesic effect than propofol on the recognition memory test.  
  
**Cardiovascular:**  
\- Propofol decreases SVR, CO and thus BP.  
\- Propofol decreases SVR by the inhibition of sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve activity.  
\- The most prominent effect of propofol is the reduction of SVR accompanied by a decrease in cardiac output and blood pressure.  
\- Propofol only has direct negative inotropic actions at concentrations exceeding the clinical range  
\- Cardiac contractility remains preserved.  
\- However, a negative inotropic effect of propofol may result from a decrease in intracellular calcium availability secondary to inhibition of trans-sarcolemmal calcium influx.  
\- Propofol also inhibits the physiological baroreflex responses, thereby enhancing cardiovascular depression  
\- This effect is dose-dependent and even occurs at sedative doses.  
\- The direct sympathetic stimulation caused by direct laryngoscopy and intubation of the trachea usually counters the blood pressure effects of propofol.  
\- A normal induction dose of propofol should be avoided for patients with moderate to severe compromised cardiac function (cardiac output) due to its cardiac depressant effects.  
\- Etomidate and/or ketamine may be a better option.  
**\- Nitrous oxide** does not alter the CV effects of Propofol.  
  
**Propofol-induced bradycardia:** 1.4 of every 100,000 cases.  
\- Profound bradycardia, asystole, and death have been documented in adult healthy patients after propofol administration despite prophylactic anticholinergics.  
\- The poor response to atropine suggests propofol may induce sympathetic nervous system activity suppression.  
\- A direct β-agonist such as isoproterenol may be required to treat as needed.  
  
**Pulmonary:** Propofol is a potent ventilatory depressant.\- Propofol produces dose-dependent depression of ventilation with apnea occurring in 25-35% of patients after induction.  
\- The coadministration of opioids enhances it.  
\- Adding low-dose ketamine to propofol (ketofol) without coadministration of opioids and benzodiazepines drastically decreases the incidence and duration of propofol-induced apnea.  
\- Higher doses of propofol depress the ventilatory response to hypercapnia due to the effect on central chemoreceptors.  
**Bronchodilation:** Propofol can produce bronchodilation and decrease the intraoperative incidence of wheezing in asthmatic patients.  
  
**HPV (hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction)**  
HPV remains intact during propofol administration.  
  
**Hepatic:  
**\- Propofol does not usually affect liver enzyme levels.  
\- However, prolonged propofol infusions have been associated with propofol infusion syndrome.  
\- Propofol infusion syndrome may result in lactic acidosis, hepatocellular injury, bradydysrhythmias, and rhabdomyolysis.  
  
**Renal:  
**Propofol does not affect renal function or creatinine levels.  
  
**Urine discoloration:  
Green urine:** This may result from prolonged infusions of propofol resulting in phenols in the urine.**  
Cloudy urine:  
**\- Urinary uric acid excretion is increased after administration of propofol.  
It may manifest as cloudy urine when the uric acid crystallizes in the urine under low pH and temperature conditions.  
\- This cloudy urine is NOT a concern.  
**  
Intraocular pressure:**  
\- Propofol is associated with significant decreases in intraocular pressure that occur immediately after induction of anesthesia and are sustained during tracheal intubation.  
  
**Propofol and strabismus surgery:**  
\- Compared with other anesthetics, propofol has a higher incidence of oculocardiac reflex in pediatric strabismus surgery despite prior administration of anticholinergics.  
\- Awake patients respond more.  
  
**Propofol and ophthalmologic surgery under MAC:**  
\- Photic sneeze reflex.  
\- Some individuals exhibit a reflex that manifests in sneezing in response to sunlight or bright light.  
\- It is an inherited phenotype that affects 18–35% of the world's population, but its exact mechanism of action is not well understood.  
\- Sneezing is provoked not necessarily by light itself but by a change in light intensity.  
\- If disruptive sneezing occurs under the microscope, especially after injection of a peribulbar block, an IV injection of pheniramine maleate has been reported to terminate the sneezing within one minute.  
\- Propofol augments the expression of this reflex.  
\- Pheniramine (the preferred treatment) is usually not readily available.  
  
**Propofol has antioxidant vitamin E properties:  
**\- Propofol has antioxidant properties that resemble endogenous vitamin E.  
\- Like vitamin E, propofol contains a phenolic hydroxyl group that scavenges free radicals and inhibits lipid peroxidation.  
  
**Propofol and stereotactic surgery:**  
\- Propofol can temporarily eliminate tremors in patients with Parkinson’s disease.  
\- A continuous infusion of propofol should be avoided in patients undergoing stereotactic neurosurgery during which the symptom is required to identify the correct anatomic location.  
  
**Bacterial growth and risk of infection**  
\- Propofol supports bacterial growth once the vial is open.  
\- The high lipid formulation supports rapid microbial growth of _Escherichia coli_ and _Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In contrast, the_ solvent (Intralipid) appears to be bactericidal for these same organisms and bacteriostatic for _Candida albicans._  
\- Inadvertent contamination of the formulation can cause potentially lethal postoperative sepsis.  
\- The contents of an opened ampule must be discarded if they are not used within 6 hours.  
In the ICU, the tubing or any unused portion of propofol should be discarded in 12 hours.  
  
**0.005% Disodium edetate (EDTA)** was added in 1996 to the propofol formulation to inhibit the growth rate of microorganisms for up to 12 hours in the event of accidental extrinsic contamination.**Hyperlipidemia and propofol:**  
Prolonged infusion in the ICU over many days as a sedative to facilitate mechanical ventilation has been associated with hyperlipidemia in the intensive care unit setting.  
  
**Propofol and cesarean section:  
**\- Propofol readily crosses the placenta but is rapidly cleared from the neonatal circulation.  
\- Due to its rapid clearance from the neonatal circulation, it has only minimal and short-lived clinical effects in unborn neonates and is thus safe for use during cesarean section.  
**  
Propofol and breast milk:  
**\- Crosses the placenta and enters breast milk.  
\- Oral consumption of propofol results in a high first-pass effect with a high hepatic extraction rate of greater than ninety percent.  
  
**Allergies contraindicating propofol:  
**\- Propofol or any of its contents  
\- Allergies to eggs and egg products and soybeans and soybean products were formerly thought to be contraindications to the use of propofol.  
\- Recent studies DO NOT support a connection between propofol hypersensitivity and allergy to egg, soy, or peanuts.  
**  
Propofol concerns:**  
**Caution in the presence of cardiac dysfunction (decreased EF) and hypovolemia  
**\- May cause severe hypotension.  
\- Adequate hydration is recommended.  
\- Consider etomidate as the alternative induction agent in the presence of decreased EF.  
  
**Extravasation:  
**\- Extravasation of propofol may cause local pain, swelling, blisters, and tissue necrosis.  
\- Propofol is directly irritating to the venous intima.  
\- Propofol also activates the kallikrein-kinin system, which results in bradykinin production.  
\- Bradykinin dilates and increases the permeability of the vein.  
\- As a result, the aqueous phase propofol irritates more free nerve endings outside the endothelial layer of the vessel.  
  
**Propofol infusion syndrome (“PRIS”):  
**\- Continuous infusions of propofol greater than 75 mg/kg/min greater than 24 hours are associated with PRIS in adults and especially in the pediatric population in the ICU\- For this reason, propofol infusion is avoided in pediatric ICU patients.  
\- Due to PRIS, propofol infusions for adult patients being mechanically ventilated in ICU are usually limited to 50 mg/kg/min and titrated to maintain arousal to stimulation.  
**  
Signs of propofol infusion syndrome:  
**Metabolic (lactic) acidosis  
Rhabdomyolysis  
Cardiac arrhythmias  
Myocardial failure  
Multiorgan failure  
Death  
**  
The manufacturer’s instructions for discarding propofol:**  
**The 2020 edition of the Physicians’ Desk Reference contains the following recommendations for the formulation of propofol bearing the proprietary name Diprivan®:**  
\- Administration for ICU sedation directly from the vial must be completed within 12 hours of spiking the vial; discard tubing and any unused portion after 12 hours.  
\- If transferred to a syringe or other container before administration for ICU sedation, discard unused portions and IV lines at the end of the procedure or within 12 hours of opening the  
\- Diprivan® vial, whichever is sooner.  
\- For general anesthesia or procedural sedation, draw into sterile syringes immediately after opening the vials.  
\- After the vial is spiked, complete administration within 12 hours.  
  
**Main adverse effects of propofol:  
**Hypotension (decreases SVR)  
Loss of airway reflexes  
Hypoventilation  
Apnea  
  
**Other possible adverse reactions (less common):  
**\- Anaphylaxis  
\- Propofol infusion syndrome (PRIS)  
**  
CNS:  
**\- Dizziness, headache, myoclonus, posturing, and seizure-like movement phenomena (jerking, thrashing).  
\- Prolonged myoclonus similar to that seen in meningitis has been associated with propofol.  
\- Seizures have been noted when propofol infusions were discontinued.  
**Resp:** Cough, bronchospasm  
**CV:** Bradycardia, hypertension, supraventricular tachydysrhythmias  
**GI:** Abdominal cramping, hiccups, nausea, vomiting  
**Skin:** Flushing or pruritus.  
**Local:** Burning, pain, stinging, cold sensation, numbness, and tingling at the IV site.  
**Musculoskeletal:** Perioperative myoclonus, posturing, and seizure-like movement phenomena (jerking, thrashing).  
**Genitourinary:** Green discoloration of urine (after prolonged infusion)  
Propofol infusion syndrome  
Fever  
  
**Drug-drug interactions:**  
**Additive CNS and respiratory depression when used in combination with:**  
Alcohol  
Antihistamines  
Opioid  
Analgesics  
Sedative/hypnotics(reduced dose may be required).  
  
\- The supplementation by alfentanil enhances the effects of propofol on hemodynamic function.  
\- Cardiorespiratory instability can occur when used with acetazolamide.  
\- Serious bradycardia can occur with concurrent use of fentanyl in children.  
\- Increases risk of hypertriglyceridemia with intravenous fat emulsion.  
  
**Physical (IV Site) incompatibility:**  
Amikacin  
Amphotericin B deoxycholate  
Calcium chloride  
Ciprofloxacin  
Diazepam  
Digoxin  
Doxorubicin  
Gentamicin  
Levofloxacin  
Methotrexate  
Methylprednisolone sodium succinate  
Metoclopramide  
Mitoxantrone  
Phenytoin  
Tobramycin  
Verapamil  
  
**Abuse potential:**  
\- There is accumulating evidence suggesting its potential for abuse.  
\- Clinical and experimental evidence has revealed that not only does propofol have the potential to be abused, but also that addiction to propofol shows a high mortality rate.  
  
**Accidental intra-arterial injection of propofol:  
**\- Arterial administration results in severe pain but no lasting vascular damage.  
\- Case reports suggest that there is immediate pain followed by hyperemia and blanching of the local and distal skin.  
  
**Propofol is contraindicated in two patient categories:**  
\- Patients with hypersensitivity to propofol or any of the components of its formulation  
\- Patients with fat metabolism disorders.  
  
**Patients allergic to eggs, egg products, soybeans, or soy products:**  
\- Since a small number of case reports of anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have been published, the Diprivan® package insert also advises against Diprivan® use in patients with allergies to eggs, egg products, soybeans, or soy products.  
\- However, Asserhøj and colleagues could not confirm the link between propofol and food allergies in two extensive retrospective studies.
