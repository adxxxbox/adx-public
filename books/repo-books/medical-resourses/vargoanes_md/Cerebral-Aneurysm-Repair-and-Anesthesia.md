### Cerebral Aneurysm Repair and Anesthesia

**Warning:** Until the aneurysm is clipped, DO NOT permit or allow the BP to rise above the preoperative baseline.  It will increase the aneurysm’s Transmembrane Pressure (TMP) and increase the risk of rupture.  
  
Also, any reductions in ICP should be GRADUAL until the dura has been opened (ICP = 0) because sudden reductions in ICP will also produce rapid increases in the aneurysm’s TMP.  This also increases the risk of a rupture.  
  
**Possible Drips:  
Nipride or Nitroglycerine  
Neosynephrine**  
**Remifentanil and Propofol** usually with 0.5-1 MAC of Isoflurane.  
Warning:  > 0.5 MAC increases CBF and possibly ICP.   
**Precedex:** A great drug for a smooth induction and emergence.  
  
**Anesthetic Goals:  
Maintain optimum CPP**: Neosynephrine (titrate to effect) is popular. However, if the aneurysm ruptures intra-op, you will need to immediately drop the MAP to 50 mmHg, which decreases the CPP.  
**Decrease intracranial volume** (blood and tissue): Mannitol, Lasix, hyperventilation and normovolemia are the goals. These drugs and anesthetic actions all create more working space for surgeons and minimize the amount of brain retraction needed.  
**Decrease metabolic rate and CRMO­2:** This is accomplished by temperature, gases and drugs. This enables the brain to tolerate hypotension and ischemia if sudden decreases in MAP and CPP become necessary. Avoid hyperthermia.  
  
**Pre-op:**  
If these patients already have a SAH, they may be on a Calcium Channel blocker (Nimodipine or Nicardipine or both) prophylactically for post SAH cerebral vasospasm. Literature everywhere states that severe hypotension may occur after induction. This seems very rare.  
  
Your patient maybe on “Triple H” therapy.  Always ask the surgeon where he wants the patient’s BP. (For Triple H Therapy, read  “Vasospasms after a Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.”)   
  
**Cerebral Aneurysm and Bypass:**  
You will find literature about the patient possibly going on bypass via the groin vessels. This is usually only seen with basilar aneurysms and it is rare.  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
**Note:** If the patient is a grade 4 or 5 SAH, they are usually already intubated. Tape the ETT on opposite side of the aneurysm.  
**Induction Position:** HOB up 15-30 degrees to facilitate venous drainage and drainage of CSF.  
**Induction:** Goal is to induce gently to avoid increasing BP. Increasing the BP may cause the cerebral aneurysm to rupture. The mortality rate associated with aneurysmal rupture during induction is substantial. Large drops in BP can also compromise the CPP.  
**Blood Pressure:** The BP should be kept within 20mmHg below the baseline Systolic BP until the aneurysm is approached.  
**Thiopental:** It is OK to use, but many hospital pharmacies don’t stock it.

**Propofol or Etomidate:** Yes to use.  
**Esmolol:** 100-150mg 2 minutes before laryngoscopy to prevent transient tachycardia and HTN.   
**Fentanyl:** 5-10mcg/kg a few minutes prior to laryngoscopy.  
**Nitroglycerine:** Connected and ready to titrate to effect.  
Also have a Nitro diluted syringe handy. 1-2 mLs of Nitro mixed with NS or LR in a 10cc syringe.  
**LTA Kit**: You should, but many still don’t use one.  
**Hyperventilation**: For a non-ruptured aneurysm, it is not a good idea to hyperventilate the patient after intubation to lower the ICP. Sudden decreases in ICP will still increase TMP.    
**Remifentanil:** Can also be used to blunt the effects of direct laryngoscopy (see below).  
**Remi Induction dose:** 1-3mcg/kg over 1 minute.  
**Remi-Induction drip:** 0.5- 1mcg/kg/min and intubate in 5-8 minutes.  
**Muscle Relaxants:** **YES, NO MOVEMENT!**  
Anectine increases ICP; avoid it if at all possible. However, if there is a difficult airway, you may need it because hypoxia and hypercarbia is worse for the ICP. Usually awake fiber-optic intubations are not a good idea. Glidescope intubation and follow with a Non-depolarizing Muscle Relaxant when twitches have returned.  
**Muscle Relaxants:** Usually Rocuronium or Vecuronium.  
**Warning:** The duration of action of a NDMR is reduced by many anticonvulsants. Atracurium and Cisatracurium are not affected by anticonvulsants because of Hoffman elimination. However, we still mostly use Roc or Vec.  
**IV Access:** 1-2 large bore IVs (14-18Gs)  
**Type & Cross: Yes.  
2 units of PRBCs in the room:** Yes, PRBCs should be in the room and checked and hanging but not spiked. You will need to start infusing the blood immediately if the aneurysm ruptures.

**IV Fluid:** All texts books say NSS, but most of us still use LR.  
**Hydration:** Normovolemia: volume restriction is no longer used to treat elevated ICP.   
Avoid Dextrose containing IVs as the large sugar molecule has a huge oncotic pull and exacerbates ischemia. It increases neuronal lactate production which carries a risk of neurological deficits (**_Resuscitation,_ June 1990, Volume 19:3, 271-289)** and edema.  
**Temperature:** Normothermic.  
Hyperthermia increases brain damage.  
Hypothermia (decrease body temp by 2°–3°C) can cause major neuro-protection. Sometimes used with bypass.  
**Inhalation Agent:** Usually Isoflurane.  
**Nitrous Oxide:** NO, when combined with a volatile anesthetic, it can further increase CBF. When given alone, nitrous oxide causes mild cerebral vasodilation and can potentially increase ICP.  
**Central Line and CVP**: Not common anymore unless they expect a large EBL or a very long case. However, some already have a central line for “Triple H” therapy from the ICU.  
**A-line:** Yes, if one is not already established from the ICU, we usually insert one just prior to induction on the operating room table while the patient is more sedated.  
**Neuro Monitoring:** Possibly Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), motor evoked potentials (MEP), and electromyography(EMG). The surgeon should inform the anesthesia team well in advance, usually at time of posting of the procedure.  
  
**Positioning:** Find out ahead of time if possible.  
Anterior Aneurysm: Supine with head 30-45 degrees turned away.  
Posterior Aneurysm: Lateral or supine.  
**Head stability:** Mayfield Head Pins.  
**Mayfield Pins and Propofol:** The application of Mayfield Pins is very stimulating. Most of us bolus with 50-100 mg of Propofol just prior to prevent the BP from skyrocketing. So have some extra Propofol available. If you are using a Remifentanil drip, you can bolus it rather than Propofol. Sometimes the surgeon may inject a local to decrease the stimulation of the placement of the pins.  
  
Make sure the patient’s head is not flexed or rotated laterally too far because it could decrease jugular venous drainage and can increase ICP.  
Make sure your circuit tubing is stretched out and aligned correctly before the staff rotates the bed 90-180 degrees. Many of us tape the vent tubing out over the patient’s chest.  
Arms are usually to the side but not tightly tucked.  
**Duration:**   
Anterior Circulation Aneurysm: 3-5h  
Posterior Circulation Aneurysm 3-6h  
**EBL:** 250-1,000mLs  
   
**Intra-Op Maintenance**  
As mentioned earlier, you need to ask the surgeon where he wants the BP. Communication is key. Titrate your inhalation agents, drips and narcotics for the desired BP. Don’t use crystalloids to correct hypotension.  
**Ventilation:** Only mildly hyperventilate. Try keeping the ETCO2 30-35mmHg.  
For every 1 mm Hg decrease in PaCO2, the CBF decreases by 1-2 mL/100g/min and is usually adequate to offset the vasodilatory effects of volatile anesthetics.  
If you hyperventilate, the resultant hypocarbia could decrease cerebral perfusion.   
Avoid Peep >10 cm H2O. It could decrease venous drainage and increase ICP.  
**ABGs:** Take a baseline sample. Consider switching to LR if there is metabolic acidosis.  
Literature states there is a potential for hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with NS IV.  
This is very rare. Adjust ventilation using your PaCO2 results.  
**Blood Loss:** Should be replaced at a 3:1 ratio (3L crystalloid per 1 liter EBL) to a hematocrit of 25-30%.  
**When the Dura is opened:** After the dural is opened, there is less stimulation and you can reduce the Remifentanil/Diprivan infusions or other agents.  
**Dissection and Clipping the Aneurysm:**  
Goal is to induce hypotension at this time. Decrease MAP to 50mmHg or whatever the surgeon tells you. The usual thing to do is to reduce the MAP to about 60mmHg as the surgeon is approaching the aneurysm and only go to 50mmHg with clipping. Some surgeons prefer no talking or noise during this time so get your game plan clear before the surgeon gets ready to clip.  
**Post-Clipping the Aneurysm:**  
Once the aneurysm is clipped, the BP is raised to the pre-op level via infusions; this should be done slowly over about 10 minutes. Once the BP has returned to baseline and the surgeon is beginning to close, you could ease up on ventilation and let the ETCO2 go to 40mmHg.  
  
**Brain Protection Meds:**  
If you don’t know your surgeon’s regiment, you should ask him/her about the three drugs below. The surgeon will tell you how much and when to give them.   
**Mannitol:** 0.25-1gram/kg (25-50g) prior to opening the Dura.  
**Lasix:** usually 10-20mg prior to opening the Dura.  
**Steroids:** Usually Decadron or Solu Medrol. 10mg Q2 hours is not unusual.  
**Dilantin:** 1g, rarely given anymore. Don’t bolus Dilantin.  
**After Dural Incision:**  Anesthetic requirements drop substantially because the brain has no pain receptors. At this point, Propofol 50-150mcg/kg/min with Remifentanil 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg/min would be adequate while avoiding a slow wake up.  
After the head dressing is applied the table will be turned back to its original position towards you.  
**Reversal:** It is recommended not to reverse your muscle relaxant until the dressing is on.  
**Emergence Warning:** There is an association between emergence hypertension and post-operative hemorrhage. So avoid bucking and hypertension. Don’t hesitate to beta block the patient with Labetalol.  
  
**Emergence Recommendations:**  
Sit the patient up at 20° and place the arterial transducer at the level of the head.  
Check with the surgeon concerning deep or awake extubation. We usually perform a deep extubation unless there was a difficult airway. Surgeons now rarely perform a neurologic exam before leaving the operating room.   
 

**Popular Cranial Surgery Emergence Drugs** 

**Lidocaine:** 1.5mg/kg 1-2 minutes prior to suctioning and extubation.  
**Labetalol:** 40-60mg with emergence if the BP permits.  

**Prededex Drip:** Can also be used for emergence/extubation pathway. Precedex dose range is 0.2-1 mcg/kg/hr. Using the 200mcg/2mL vial (100mcg/mL), inject 2 vials into a 100mLs bag of  NSS, thus giving you 4 mcg/mL.  For a 80kg patient, 0.5mcg/kg/hr rate is infused at 10mLs/hr.  
  
**Antiemetics:** PONV is very common with Craniotomies. Studies show a prophylactic antiemetic given shortly before emergence reduces PONV. 4mg Zofran is the standard.

**Emergence Recommendations:**  
Check with the surgeon concerning deep or awake extubation. We usually perform a deep extubation unless there was a difficult airway.  
  
Give 1.5mg/kg of Lidocaine 1-2 minutes prior to suctioning and extubation.  
Consider prophylactic labetalol 40-60mg with emergence if the BP permits. Emergence hypertension contributes to hematoma formation.    
  
**If the patient does not wake up, it could be from:**  
Elevated ICP   
Residual anesthesia or paralysis  
CO2 narcosis, hypoxia, and hypercarbia.  
Consider giving physostigmine (0.01-0.03 mg/kg) and/or Narcan (0.04 - 0.4 mg) to facilitate awakening.

  
**More Notes:**  
**_Purple haze all in my brain!_**  
**_Isoflurane_** **protects brain through two mechanisms:**  
It reduces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters by a presynaptic mechanism with  an effect comparable to hypothermia (K Nakashima et al 1996).  
It decreases neuronal metabolism by another nontoxic mechanism of action.  
It lowers glucose takeover in neurons, thereby reducing risk of neuronal deficits.  
It can induce an EEG isoelectric line at non-toxic concentrations (2MAC).  
Combining TIVA and Isoflurane is becoming popular.   
 

**Mayfield Pin Complications**  
Severe hypertension with application.  
Over tightening may lead to a micro skull fracture.  
Bleeding that requires suturing.  
A laceration because the pins are not tight enough and patient’s head moves.
