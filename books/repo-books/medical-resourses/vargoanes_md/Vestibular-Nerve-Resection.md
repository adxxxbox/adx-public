### Vestibular Nerve Resection (Vestibular Neurectomy)

**Indication:** When the attacks of vertigo from Meniere’s disease cannot be controlled with medication in patients whose hearing is still intact.  
A transmastoid incision is made and the surgeon works his way in to surgically cut the vestibular part of the cochleovestibular cranial nerve (leaving the cochlear portion of the nerve intact). This operation is done with a neurosurgeon. This procedure is not as popular, due to transtympanic Gentamycin injections. The procedure is still useful when the Gentamicin fails, or when the site of lesion is between the inner ear and brainstem.

**Anesthetic**: General/ETT  
**Positioning:** Supine with the patient’s head turned away with ipsilateral arm tucked.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Depends on facial nerve monitoring.  
**Duration:** Around 2 hours  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
**Facial Nerve Monitoring:** Yes, The facial nerve is in close relationship to the cochleovestibular cranial nerve (cranial nerve VIII).  
**Emergence:** Smooth  
Consider PONV meds

**Other Notes:**  
The success rate (no more vertigo attacks) is over 90%.   
Mild hearing loss in the operated ear occurs in some patients. In very rare cases, total hearing loss occurs. Tinnitus may remain, disappear or get worse.  
  
 

**Spinal Fluid Leak**  
Rarely, persistent CSF leaks from the wound occur. The patient must remain in the hospital with a spinal fluid drain in place for 3 or 4 days until the leak stops. Rarely, further surgery is necessary.
