### TIVA and Precedex

**Dexmedetomidine (Precedex)/Ketamine/Propofol – No syringe pumps  
**_By Lisa Scheller, CRNA, Evansville, Indiana_  
  
Administer 0.1-0.2mg of glycopyrrolate (Robinul), prior to TIVA.

**Have 3 syringes drawn up**  
50 ml syringe of Dexmedetomidine (Precedex) diluted to 4 mcg//ml.  
Ketamine (10mg/ ml)  
Propofol (10mg/ ml)

200mcg of dexmedetomidine (Precedex) diluted to a total volume of 50 ml = 4mcg/ml (This technique requires no pump, just small boluses of 3-5 ml every 2 minutes or so) Since dexmedetomidine (Precedex) has a slow onset, start with 20-30mg of propofol. Then SLOWLY push 3-5 ml (12-20mcg) dexmedetomidine (Precedex) every 2 minutes or so.  
Push SLOWLY or the patient may become bradycardic.  
Prior administration of 0.1-0.2 mg glycopyrrolate (Robinul) helps prevent both bradycardia from dexmedetomidine and secretions caused by ketamine.

**Ketamine:** 10-20 mg ketamine every 15-20 minutes (< 0.5mg/kg total)  
**Propofol:** 10-20mg propofol every 2-3 minutes

**Short procedures:** like endoscopy cases, all sedatives are administered manually; no fentanyl or midazolam is used.

**For longer MAC procedures:**  
Propofol at 50 mcg/kg/min via pump; manually bolus the ketamine and dexmedetomidine.  
Usually 0.5mcg/kg/hr of Precedex is sufficient.  
1mcg/kg/hr is safe.  
Consider administering 25mcg of fentanyl at a time if indicated.

For gamma knife cases.  
First administer 1-2 mg of midazolam.  
Dilute 200 mcg of dexmedetomidine (one 2ml vial of Precedex) with 48 ml of saline in an appropriate syringe, or dexmedetomidine 400 mcg (two 2ml vials of Precedex) diluted in 96 ml of saline (e.g. a 100 ml bag with 4 ml withdrawn prior to adding dexmedetomidine).  
  
Start the infusion of dexmedetomidine at 0.2-0.3 mcg/kg/hr.  
No bolus is required.  
As soon as the gamma knife procedure is over I walk in and immediately turn it off. By the time we have their head unhooked from the machine they can sit up and then get themselves into the wheel chair. It seems to be just enough to also get the frame off as well.
