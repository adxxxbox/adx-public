Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP) Values    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP) Values

MAP-ICP (or CVP) = CPP  
**Intact autoregulation CPP has a wide range:** 50 to 150 mm Hg  
**Normal CPP:** 70 to 110mmHg  
**CPP < 50 mmHg:** Slowing of the EEG  
**CPP 25-40 mmHg:** Flat EEG  
**CPP < 25 mmHg:**  Irreversible brain damage  
  
The Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) guideline recommends a target cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) value between 60 and 70 mmHg.  
The “optimal” CPP target within this range is, however, uncertain and may depend upon the patient's autoregulatory status.  
  
_The goal for maintaining the CPP is to ensure that the CPP is high enough to perfuse the brain, while preventing excessive CPP elevations that might worsen any cerebral edema._  
A decrease in the CPP suggests that the gradient required to push blood toward the brain is not being maintained.  
This can cause brain ischemia from reduced cerebral blood flow.  
  
**CPP with an injured brain (impaired autoregulation):**  
Cerebral blood flow approximates a straight-line relationship with CPP; that is, reductions of CBF are more severe at any given level of reduced CPP.  
  
**CCP with an elevated ICP:  
**If the ICP rises, a normal compensatory response is to increase the systemic BP in an attempt to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure.   
Hypertension in the presence of brain injury may be a life-saving response and frequently indicates raised intracranial pressure.  
  
CPP must be closely regulated within 70 to 120 mmHg in patients with increased ICP because reductions below this level can lead to secondary hypoxic-ischemic damage, whereas excessive increases can lead to “breakthrough” hyperperfusion and aggravation of cerebral edema.  
  
**Avoid elevated CPP:**  
When a brain injury occurs, cerebral capillaries can become "leaky" or more permeable to water.  
In addition, cerebral blood vessels may dilate in response to brain tissue injury, hypoxemia, hypercarbia, acidosis, or hypotension.  
If the MAP becomes elevated, the increased CPP can lead to increased cerebral blood flow.  
When combined with increased capillary permeability or cerebral vasodilation, blood flow can increase to the point where brain edema worsens.  
  
**Elevated CPP is associated with ARDS:  
**Targeting high CPP ≥70 mmHg has not been shown to be beneficial in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is associated with an increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).  
  
**Causes of decreased CCP:  
**Decreased MAPIncreased ICP without a corresponding rise in systemic blood pressure.  
**Treatment for a low CPP:** Should be aimed at correcting the underlying cause (i.e., by increasing the MAP or lowering the ICP).  
  
The degree of elevation above normal and the duration of time that the ICP is high are important indicators of brain injury.  
  
**Avoid hypotension in procedures involving steep Trendelenburg:**  
In steep Trendelenburg, the CVP or ICP is drastically elevated, so it is obvious here not to permit a low MAP.  
The maintenance of stable blood pressure is critical to CPP management, and central venous pressure monitoring with a subclavian central venous catheter can guide fluid management.  
Fluid resuscitation and use of vasopressors (norepinephrine, phenylephrine, or dopamine), if necessary, may be required to maintain an adequate CPP.
