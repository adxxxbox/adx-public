### Heart Transplant-Simplified Operative Procedure

The surgeon performs a median sternotomy and then opens the pericardium. The aorta and the inferior and superior vena cava are cannulated, followed by cardiac bypass. The native heart is removed, but the posterior right atrium remains attached, leaving the pulmonary venous orifices, inferior and superior vena cava. The remaining portion of the right atrium is also still attached to the posterior intra-atrium with the posterior left atrium. Then the surgeon appropriately trims out the donor heart’s right atrium, places in the donor heart with anastomoses in the following order:  
Left atrium  
Right atrium to the native right atrial wall and septum.  
Pulmonary artery  
Aorta

**After the anastomosis:**  
A vent is inserted in the aorta to remove air from the heart.  
Patient is sometimes placed in Trendelenburg.  
Cross Clamp is removed. Give 1 gram of Solu-Medrol.  
The heart starts to beat. It may be sluggish because it has been stored in ice for around 4 hours. It gets stronger with warming.  
Wean from Bypass.  
Epicardial pacing wires are inserted before closure.
