### Local Anesthetic Effects on the Cardiovascular System

CVS is more resistant to the effects local anesthetics than the CNS.  
Severe cardiac depression from local anesthetics are extremely rare.  
  
Decrease the conduction in Purkinje fibers and cardiomyocytes by prolonging the recovery time-decreasing conduction rate.  
  
A direct myocardial depressant related to reduced Ca2+ influx and release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This decreases the force of conduction.  
  
Hypotension - from the direct relaxant action on vascular smooth muscle from the blockage of B fibers.  
  
There are two theories for why Bupivacaine causes a malignant ventricular arrhythmia far greater Lidocaine. We both know that Lidocaine and Bupivacaine can both block cardiac Na channels during systole.  
  
1.) Bupivacaine dissociates form the Na channels during diastole at a much slower rate than  
Lidocaine.  
  
2.) Bupivacaine being so highly lipid soluble makes it easier (in high concentrations) to cross  
the blood brain barrier in the brain stem to cause systemic hypotension, bradycardia and  
ventricular arrhythmias.  
  
This is one reason why we use very low concentrations of Bupivacaine in OB; to decrease the risk of toxicity and less motor block to preserve pushing during labor.  
  
Bupivacaine is four times more potent than lidocaine in blocking nerves and depressing cardiac contractility.  
4 mcg/mL blood level of Bupivacaine with result in seizures4-6 mcg/mL is associated with cardiac toxicity.  
Lidocaine is 20-25 mcg/mL for cardiac toxicity.  
  
**Safety Points on Ropivacaine**  
Ropivacaine is a less toxic drug than bupivacaine.  
A 20 mg dose in a laboring patient is less than 0.33 mg/kg.  
This is a very safe and effective dose of local anesthetic.  
If 20 mg of ropivacaine was administered accidentally intravenously, it would be safer than bupivacaine, and depending on the rate of delivery, may NOT cause any symptoms. If a dose was accidentally given intrathecally, it is still an acceptable dose for spinal ropivacaine.
