### Blepharoplasty/Blepharoptosis Repair

This is an eyelid surgery that improves the appearance and/or function of the upper eyelids, lower eyelids, or both. It often gives a better field of vision as well.  

**Indications of** **Blepharoplasty/****Blepharoptosis Repair:**

Excess fatty deposits that appear as puffiness in the upper eyelids.

Loose or sagging skin that creates folds or disturbs the natural contour of the upper eyelid, sometimes impairing vision.

Lower eyelid blepharoplasty can remove excess skin and fine wrinkles of the lower eyelid.

Bags under the eyes is a phrase for droopiness of the lower eyelids, showing white below the iris (colored portion of the eye).  

**Anesthetic:** MAC with a subconjunctival injection of local anesthesia. Administer Propofol or Alfenta just prior to the bilateral local injections. 2 mg of Versed is also common.  
**Duration:** 60-90 minutes  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 22G is acceptable. A 500mL NS bag with micro drip tubing is popular.  
**Position:** Supine with arms tucked and the patient remains on the same stretcher. Make sure the ETCO2 NC or Salter cannula is looped away from the surgical eye. The stretcher is parked 90-180 degrees away from you -unless you are starting out as a general.
