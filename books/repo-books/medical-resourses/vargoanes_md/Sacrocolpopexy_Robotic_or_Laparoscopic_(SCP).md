### Sacrocolpopexy Robotic or Laparoscopic (SCP)

\- Robotic procedures are becoming more popular for SCP.  
\- SCP is an operation to correct uterine prolapse or correct vaginal vault prolapse in women with a hysterectomy.  
\- This surgery offers long-term treatment of apical prolapse with success rates greater than 80 percent.  
\- The surgeon applies surgical mesh to the front and back walls of the vagina and then to the sacrum to suspend the top of the vagina or the cervix back into its normal position.  
\- This procedure required a large abdominal incision (laparotomy) in the past.  
  
**Pre-op:**  
**IV access:** Two IVs are recommended because there is poor access once the arms are tucked.  
**Bowel prep:** Usually  
**ERAS protocol:** Becoming more common  
  
**Anesthesia:** General/ETT  
**Positioning:** Deep Trendelenburg, lithotomy with arms tucked.  
The stability of the patient’s positioning should be checked while in steep Trendelenburg prior to applying the surgical drape and prepping.  
**Duration:** 3 to 5 hours (depends on the surgeon and anatomy)  
**Face Protection:** Yes, a foam donut pillow or cradle is placed over the face.  
Some of the robotic equipment is placed on the drapes over the patient’s face.  
  
**\- Eye protection:** Yes, consider applying eye goggles and leaving them on the patient until they are fully awake in the recovery room.  
\- Scleral edema is common in robotic procedures that require steep Trendelenburg.  
\- Corneal abrasions are more common with these patients as patients tend to rub their eyes postoperatively when scleral edema is present.  
**Neosynephrine drip:** Consider connecting one prior to the arms being tucked.  
**EBL:** 100 – 150 mLs  
**OGT:** Consider it, especially if the patient has gastroparesis.  
  
**Ventilation Issues:** Yes, change to Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV).  
\- Once the patient is in steep Trendelenburg, the abdominal contents will shift against the diaphragm, decreasing FRC, compliance and lung volumes.  
\- Due to the elevated peak pressures, it will become difficult to volume ventilate. This is significantly exaggerated with obese patients with large bellies.  
  
**Possible areas for hemorrhage:**  
\- When the surgeon is trying to find the sacral promontory, the right common iliac vein can be perforated if the dissection is too far cephalad and lateral. The middle sacral artery can be perforated during dissection of the fat pad from the promontory.  
\- In securing the mesh to the sacral promontory, the surgeon can puncture the left common iliac vein if he/she is not aware of the exit point of the needle and it traverses too far medially.  
\- Damaging a plexus of veins traverses the hollow of the sacrum, with applying the mesh at the level of S2-3.  
  
**Possible complications:  
**Severe bradycardia with the initiation of the pneumoperitoneum.  
Hemorrhage  
Bowel or ureter damage  
Corneal abrasion (patient rubbing their eyes from irritating scleral edema)  
Mesh failure  
Aspiration (from steep Trendelenburg)  
Atelectasis (from inadequate ventilation due to high peak airway pressures)  
Recuring vaginal vault prolapse  
Infection
