# Scopolamine Patch

**Class:** Anticholinergic, Antiemetic  
Belladonna Alkaloid  
1.5mg Patch is standard.  
**Doses:**  
PONV: Place patch behind an ear (postauricular) the evening before or minimally 4 hours before surgery and remove after 24 hours.  
**PONV for C-sec:** 1h before scheduled C-sec to limit exposure to the infant.  
**Motion Sickness:** at least 4 hours prior to exposure every 3 days as needed.  
**Peds >12yo Motion Sickness:** at least 4 hours prior to exposure every 3 days as needed.  
Less effective if given during nausea.  
**Indication:** prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness and recovery from anesthesia and surgery.  
**Lacks the SE:** sedation, cycloplegia or antisialagogue effects that IV Scopolamine causes, or very mild.  
**Absorption:** well-absorbed percutaneously. Circulating plasma levels are detected within 4 hours with peak levels being obtained, on average, within 24 hours.  
**Elimination:** Has not been determined. Following patch removal, plasma levels decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours. Less than 10% of the total dose is excreted in the urine as parent and metabolites over 108 hours.  
**Success rate:** 75% of reduction in the incidence of motion-induced nausea and vomiting.  
**Contraindications:** Anyone hypersensitive scopolamine or to other belladonna alkaloids.  
**(Anisocoria) One Dilated Pupil** -a unilateral dilated pupil can be present when one rubs their eye after applying a scopolamine patch. More than 90% occurs to pupils on the same side as the patch.  
The postauricular zone is best area for a scopolamine patch because the epidermal layer and it's slightly higher skin temperature is the ONLY area that is sufficiently permeable for a predictable and sustained absorption of scopolamine.  
There is NO histamine releasing effects with transdermal administration.
