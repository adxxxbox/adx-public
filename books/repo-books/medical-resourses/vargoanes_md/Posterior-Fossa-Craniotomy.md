#### Posterior Fossa (Infratentorial, Subtentorial) Craniotomy  
Also Review “Craniotomy Anesthesia”

**Fact:** Posterior Fossa lesions often obstruct CSF outflow, causing hydrocephalus.

Operations in the posterior fossa are often demanding, delicate, and long.

**Remember-**Infratentorial or Subtentorial means below the Tentorial Membrane. So we are referring to the brainstem and cerebellum.

**Posterior Fossa:** is the mid-lower back area of the skull that contains the brain stem and the cerebellum. That compartment is small, so even a small hematoma or edema can compromise neural function.

The brainstem is the most important area in the Infratentorial space.

**Infratentorial Surgeries are more prone to:**  
Blood loss  
Cardiac arrhythmias  
BP variations  
Venous air embolism (VAE) especially when the patient is in the sitting position.  
Urinary losses 

**Anatomical Structures at Risk:**  
Several Cranial Nerves  
The reticular activating system  
Other structures vital for control of the airway, cardiovascular and respiratory systems.  
 

**Special Concerns  
Have a syringe of Atropine available:**  
Retraction on the brainstem can cause ischemic loss of function of nuclei that regulate hemodynamics and ventilation. Sudden bradycardia is considered to be a signal of brainstem ischemia. Tell the surgeon ASAP so the retractor can be adjusted. Sometimes atropine may need to be administered.

**Be Prepared for Cardiac Reflexes-Quickly Alert the Surgeon**  
During acoustic schwannoma resections, the surgery can produce abrupt, often profound, cardiovascular responses that may signal potential damage to the brain stem.  
**Hypertension:** HTN can occur from stimulation of the floor of the fourth ventricle, medullary reticular formation, or trigeminal nerve. This response is usually abrupt, transient and gone by the time a drug is administered, and of course the inducing stimulus goes away and treatment becomes unnecessary.

**Bradycardia**: Bradycardia from the stimulation of the vagus nerve. It can be treated or prevented with Robinul or Atropine.

**Brainstem Monitoring:** Yes, (SSEPs, BAEPs or EMGs)

Operations in the area of cerebellopontine angle and lower brain stem are at risk for cranial nerve damage.

**Post-op Hypertension:** Is common after posterior fossa surgery, possibly from edema or intracranial hemorrhage.

**Possible Pre-op Presentation**  
Head Ache  
Dysphagia  
Laryngeal dysfunction  
Respiratory irregularities  
Altered airway gag reflex  
Altered states of consciousness  
  
**Positions used in Posterior Fossa Surgery:**  
See “Craniotomy Positions” section for specifics.  
Ventral/prone  
Sitting position  
Lateral position (park bench position)

**Pre-Op meds:**  
If the patient has either elevated ICP or symptomatic hydrocephalus, heavy premedication should be avoided.  
  

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT; some of us will use an armored ETT when the procedure and operating approach call for the chin to be flexed towards the chest. The flexed head may sometimes kink a regular ETT. This is still rare.  
**Duration:** Depends on the surgery: average is 2-5 hours.  
**EBL:** Depends on the surgery and position.  
**Muscle relaxation:** Yes, PREVENT ANY MOVEMENT.  
**IV Access:** Usually 2 IVs  
**A-line:** Yes, zero transducer at head level if it is a sitting case.  
**Drips:** Usually Neosynephrine and Nitroglycerine.  
**Pericordial Doppler or TEE:** Yes, for sitting position.  
**Central Line/ CVP**: rarely used anymore.  
**Hydration:** Adequate is the goal.  
**Nitrous Oxide:** Conflicting literature, but we usually avoid.  
**Ventilation:** Mild hyperventilation.  Avoid high peak pressures and Peep because they both can decrease venous return and increase ICP.  
Some PEEP is recommended for sitting position.  
   
**Emergence:  
Loss of Gag Reflex and Aspiration**  
The 9th and 10th cranial nerves regulate gag reflex and laryngeal function. Some surgeons want to test the gag reflex before extubation. Absence of the gag reflex provides sufficient reason for continued intubation to prevent aspiration.

Watch for severe tongue and facial edema from induced venous or lymphatic obstruction. Don’t extubate until it’s resolved. This is still rare.  
  
**Possible Complications:**  
Intraoperative hemorrhage  
Seizures  
Venous Air Embolus: occurs during head-elevated/sitting position or if venous sinuses are traversed.  
Damage to Cranial Nerves Cranial Nerves II, IV, V, VI, VII, IX, X, XI, and XII.
