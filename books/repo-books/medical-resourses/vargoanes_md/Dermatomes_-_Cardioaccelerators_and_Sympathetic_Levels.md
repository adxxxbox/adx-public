### Dermatome - Cardioaccelerators and Sympathetic Levels

_Always remember that neuraxial blocks result in a **sympathectomy 2-6 dermatomes above the sensory block.  
  
**_It is important to know your dermatome levels and landmarks, not only to assess if the block is adequate, but to know when to be prepared for hemodynamic changes.  
  
This enables you to anticipate the systemic and potential complications.  
  
Assessment of inadequate block will allow you to employ an alternative anesthetic technique before incision.

| Surface Anatomical Area | Dermatome Level | Effects |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fifth finger -"pinky" | C8 | Cardioaccelerator fibers blocked (T1-T4) |
| Inner area of arm and forearm | T1-T2 | Some Cardioaccelerator fibers blocked |
| Apex of Axilla | T3 | Possible Cardioaccelerator fiber blocked |
| Nipple level | T4-T5 | Possible Cardioaccelerator fiber blocked |
| Bottom of Xiphoid Process | T7 | Possible Splanchnic blockade (T5-L1) |
| Umbilicus | T10 | SNS blockage |
| Inguinal Hernia area | T12 | SNS blockage - only legs |
| Lateral Foot | S1 |  |

So as you know, for a C-section you need a sensory block all the way up to T4.  
  
That will effect S2-S4 up to T4. As stated above, the sympathectomy will be 2-6 dermatomes higher than the sensory block.  
  
Looking at the chart above, this will not only effect the sympathetic nervous system in the lower thoracic dermatomes (T12-T10), but the cardioaccelartor fibers in the upper thoracic area above the T4 sensory.
