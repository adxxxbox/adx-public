### Factor XI Deficiency-Hemophilia C

Also called Plasma Thromboplastin Antecedent (PTA) Deficiency and Rosenthal Syndrome.

Factor XI deficiency (hemophilia C) was first recognized in 1953 in patients who experienced severe bleeding after dental extractions.  
Second most common bleeding disorder affecting women (after von Willebrand disease).  
  
**Incidence:** 1 in 100,000.  
In Israel, FXI deficiency occurs in up to 8% of Ashkenazi Jews because of intermarriage.  
  
It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, thus both parents must carry the gene to pass it on to their children; men and women are affected equally.  
  
Carriers of factor XI deficiency are at elevated risk for bleeding problems. Studies have suggested that 20 to 50% of carriers of the disease show "excessive bleeding," although the definition of this phrase varies. Rarely, carriers have shown major bleeding problems.  
  
Factor XI is produced in the liver.  
  
Bleeding problems tend to occur when factor XI levels are lower than 15% of the normal level.  
  
Bleeding problems can occur, however, when levels are as high as 70% of the normal level.  
  
FXI levels in the blood do not necessarily correlate with bleeding symptoms. People with low levels may bleed less than those with higher levels.  
  
**Symptoms**  
People with low levels may bleed less than those with higher levels. Although some patients experience frequent nosebleeds or soft tissue bleeds, others first experience hemorrhaging only after tooth extraction, such as for wisdom teeth, surgery or trauma. Further, bleeding may be delayed after these procedures. Women may not know they have FXI deficiency until they experience menorrhagia (heavy menstrual periods) or postpartum bleeding. Joint and muscle bleeds are uncommon.  
  
**Labs:**  
PT/aPTT  
Factor XI assay confirms.

**Management of Anesthesia  
**Presently, factor XI concentrates are only available in Europe.  
aminocaproic acid (Amicar) or tranexamic acid may be administered for dental procedures and minor surgery.  
FFP may be administered for active bleeding.  
FXI is not concentrated in FFP, large amounts of it may be needed.  
Fibrin glue works well to maintain clots after mouth bleeds.
