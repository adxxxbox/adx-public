# Neosynephrine

**Neosynephrine (Phenylephrine Hcl)**  
3-hydroxyphenylethylamine  
Clinically mimics the effects of Levophed, but less potent/longer duration.  
**Class:** Synthetic Noncatecholamine.  
Alpha 1 Adrenergic Pressor.  
Common vasopressor used to manage mild to severe hypotension.  
**Warning:** Neosynephrine causes a reflex bradycardia and drip dose dependent. Don't give it with a low HR.  
OB/GYN - now acceptable for post SAB hypotension.  
**Doses: (always titrate to effect)**  
**IV Push:** 40-200mcg  
  
**OB/GYN:** 40-80mcg per bolus, or titrate to effect. Drips are becoming more popular right after the SAB.  
**Drip:** 40-80 mcg/min initially then 100-180 mcg/min  
  
**Infusion rates:** 10 to 200 mcg/minute or 0.1 to 2 mcg/kg/minute.  
**Most common:** 40 to 80 mcg/minute or 0.4 to 0.8 mcg/minute.  
OR 0.05-1mcg/kg/min as drip  
and 5-20mcg/kg as bolus.  
**Peds:** 0.5-10mcg/kg (rare).  
**Drip:** 0.1-0.5mcg/kg/min (rare).  
**Mix:**  
Mix one 10mg vial in 250mL of NS or D5W = 40mcg/mL.  
Mix two 10mg vials in 250mL of NS or D5W = 80mcg/mL (double strength).  
  
**MOA:** alpha adrenergic agonist.  
**Effect:** constricts both arterial and venous blood vessels.  
Arterial > Venous  
**CAD friendly:** Increases coronary perfusion pressure without chronotropic side effects.  
**Increases:** SVR, BP, PAP CVP and ICP  
**Decreases:** HR (reflex Bradycardia) and CO  
**Use:** In patients who need blood pressure support.  
**Risk:** Decreases flow of blood to all organs, reducing oxygen supply and potentiating ischemia at very high doses can have some beta effect.  
  
**Contraindications:**  
Bradycardia  
Incompatable with phentoin and alkaline solutions.  
Pheochromocytoma  
Hypertension  
Uterine vasoconstriction  
  
**Other Notes**  
Theory on Bradycardia with Neo (rapid IV injection) The decrease in CO may be from a baroreceptor reflex Bradycardia in response to drug induced increases in diastolic BP.  
  
**OB Trivia**  
Neo drip during a C-sec to maintain maternal baseline Systolic BP has a lower incidence of fetal acidosis than with Ephedrine.  
Like all potent vasoconstrictors, it can cause decreased tissue and organ perfusion.  
Just because you corrected your patient's hypotension, does not always mean all their organs are being perfused.
