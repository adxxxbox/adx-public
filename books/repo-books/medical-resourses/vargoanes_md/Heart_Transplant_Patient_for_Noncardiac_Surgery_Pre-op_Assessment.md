Heart Transplant Patient for Noncardiac Surgery-Pre-op Assessment    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Heart Transplant Patient for Noncardiac Surgery Pre-op Assessment

Elective surgeries within 6-12 months of a heart transplant should be deferred.**During this period, patients have a greater risk of complications, including:  
\- Acute rejection:** Often results in ischemic injury and right ventricular dysfunction.  
**\- Immunosuppression-related complications:**  In the first 3-6 months, these patients have higher doses of **immunosuppressants** and adrenal suppression from steroids.  
**\- Infection risk:** **The higher doses of** immunosuppressants increase infection risk.  
**  
Greater than 12-month post-transplantation concerns:**  
**\- Allograft vasculopathy  
\- Risk of malignancy, including post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease  
\- Overall level of activity and exercise tolerance**  
\- The risk of acute rejection has diminished, and the immunosuppressive regimen has usually stabilized.  
  
Continue all medications, including antihypertensive medicines.**  
Common medications for the post-heart transplant patient:  
**ACE inhibitor  
Aspirin  
Azathioprine  
Calcium carbonate  
Clotrimazole troches  
Cyclosporine  
Diltiazem  
Furosemide  
H2 Blockers  
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor  
Ketoconazole  
Prednisone  
Trimethoprin-sulfamethoxazole  
Vitamin D  
  
Cardiac clearance for nonurgent procedures is a must!  
**Risk of myocardial ischemia:**  Some patients are at a higher risk for myocardial ischemia due to transplant-related coronary artery disease (ie, cardiac allograft vasculopathy).  
\- Anesthetic management for patients with cardiac allograft vasculopathy is similar to that for other patients with ischemic heart disease.  
Note: _A study showed that coronary vasoconstriction can occur in atherosclerotic coronary arteries in transplanted hearts._  
\- However, normal coronary arteries in transplanted hearts exhibited vasodilation.  
  
**Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Post Heart Transplantation:**  
Development of CAD is accelerated, with 30% or more of recipients exhibiting significant multivessel coronary artery stenosis within 3 years after transplantation.  
  
**Assess for the common pre-op comorbidities:  
**\- Multitude of side effects of immunosuppressants-see table at the bottom of this page.  
\- Steroid-induced diabetes mellitus: Control serum glucose perioperatively  
\- Hypertension treated with ACE inhibitors or ARBs  
  
**Pulmonary assessment:  
**\- Recurrent pneumonias  
\- Lymphoproliferative diseases secondary to altered immunity  
\- Restrictive lung disease  
\- Recurrent pneumonias  
\- Related congenital anomalies in patients who have a history of congenital heart disease (CHD)  
**\- Examples include** airway abnormalities, hypotonia, and pectus excavatum  
\- Check CXR and PFTs  
  
**CNS assessment and concern:  
**\- Mental status changes, including depression and irritability, for chronic steroids  
\- Decreased seizure threshold from Cyclosporine therapy.  
\- The presence of anticonvulsant medications that may interact with anesthetic agents by increasing or lowering their plasma concentration.  
\- Cyclosporine has also been shown to enhance both the analgesic effect of opioids and the anesthetic effects of barbiturates.  
  
**Musculoskeletal and Skin  
Chronic steroid use may result in the following:  
**\- Severe osteoporosis with spinal cord compression due to fractures of the vertebrae.  
\- Aseptic necrosis of the femoral head requiring hip arthrodesis  
\- Cutaneous adverse effects of azathioprine and glucocorticoids include skin fragility, which may complicate perioperative wound care.  
  
**Assess renal function:  
**\- Nephrotoxicity from cyclosporine  
\- Post-transplantation nephrotoxic immunosuppressive drugs and repeated exposure to contrast media during cardiac catheterizations may compromise renal function.  
  
**Assess the following:**  
Baseline creatinine  
Glomerular filtration rate  
Urinalysis and spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio  
  
**Assess liver function and coags.  
**Hepatotoxicity may result from immunosuppression due to cyclosporine.  
Transaminase levels and liver synthetic function (e.g., prothrombin time)  
  
**Assess cyclosporin levels because the levels may be altered by the following:  
**IV fluid shifts  
Gastrointestinal malabsorption  
Changes in plasma protein content**ECG: The following abnormalities are common:  
\- Dual P waves:** Due to the presence of native atrial cuff tissue and the transplanted atrium, which each generates electrical activity.  
**\- Right bundle branch block:** Due to frequent endomyocardial biopsies, which are present in up to 75 percent of transplant recipients.  
**\- Atrial dysrhythmias:** Due to the lack of vagal tone and increased endogenous catecholamine levels.  
**\- First-degree AV block:**  Common after cardiac transplantation.  
**\- Pacemaker:** Some patients will be paced to maintain a high heart rate.**Fluid management:** Adequately hydrate the patient preoperatively.  
**Preload dependent:**  A transplanted heart has no rate-changing compensatory response to hypovolemia, hypotension, and sudden shifts in blood volume.  
\- Thus, they are "preload dependent" and must have adequate central volume to meet the demands of stress and of anesthetic techniques that redistribute vascular volume to the periphery.  
\- Avoid hypovolemia or hypotension, both of which decrease preload.  
\- Any loss of intravascular volume such as rapid blood loss or large fluid shifts must be immediately treated with volume administration to avoid decreased preload and severe hypotension.  
  
**Assess cardiac function prior to preoperative hydration.**  
\- Reduced ventricular compliance associated with organ rejection may result in CHF when preloading the patient  
\- Major rejection episodes may result in myocardial fibrosis.  
  
**Trivia:**  
During exercise, the denervated heart must rely on circulating levels of catecholamines and the Frank-Starling mechanism to maintain adequate cardiac output.  
**  
Pre-op:  
**\- All preoperative drug therapy must be continued.  
\- Proper functioning of a cardiac pacemaker must be confirmed.**  
  
IV Access:  
**\- Use aseptic technique because of the increased susceptibility to infection.  
\- Remember that these patients are immunosuppressed.  
  
**Invasive monitoring (arterial and central line) indications:  
**\- Use the same clinical considerations in cardiac transplant as would be used in other surgical patients.\- Indicated if significant blood loss or large intravascular volume shifts are anticipated, particularly in post-transplant patients with evidence of cardiac dysfunction.  
\- A procedure that involves frequent blood draws  
\- Frequent use of the right internal jugular vein for right heart catheterization and endomyocardial biopsy in post-transplantation patients may result in significant scarring and/or occlusion of this vessel.  
**TEE indications:** The same as other surgical patients.  
**Surgical infection prophylaxis:**  
\- Antibiotic prophylaxis is administered according to institutional protocols.  
\- Aminoglycosides and erythromycin should be avoided due to the risk of renal injury when used with calcineurin inhibitors.  
\- Certain antibiotic may potentially result in toxic levels of the calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressant drugs.  
  
**Adrenal suppression prophylaxis:  
**\- Almost all heart transplant recipient patients have a high likelihood of adrenal suppression due to chronic prednisone administration.  
\- All patients should take their usual morning dose of prednisone. table.tableizer-table { font-size: 12px; border: 1px solid #CCC; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; } .tableizer-table td { padding: 4px; margin: 3px; border: 1px solid #CCC; } .tableizer-table th { background-color: #104E8B; color: #FFF; font-weight: bold; }

| Severity of procedure | Hydrocortisone supplementation |
| --- | --- |
| Minor procedures under local anesthesia | NOT necessary |
| Moderate surgical stress | 50 mg hydrocortisone IV just before the procedure and 25 mg of hydrocortisone every eight hours for 24 hours. |
| Major surgical stress | 100 mg of hydrocortisone IV before induction of anesthesia and 50 mg every eight hours for 24 hours.  
Taper dose by half per day to maintenance level. |

**  
Airway and ventilation considerations:**  
Oral intubation is favored over a nasal to decrease risk of infection.  
  
**Avoid hyperventilation (hypocapnia):**  
\- Patients on calcineurin inhibitors (ie, cyclosporin, tacrolimus) have decreased seizure thresholds.  
  
**Choice of anesthetic technique:  
MAC with local or regional anesthesia:**  
\- Peripheral nerve block(s) with or without light sedation are acceptable techniques.  
\- They reduce the hemodynamic consequences in these patients.  
  
**Neuraxial anesthesia** **(** **spinal or epidural) may result in:**  
\- Severe hypotension from decreases in SVR  
\- Venous pooling  
\- Decreased in preload (venous return) due to sympathetic blockade in the absence of a compensatory tachycardic response and ability to preserve cardiac output.  
  
**Possible limitations of regional technique include:**  
Difficulty with positioning (steroid-induced osteoporosis)  
Obesity secondary to glucocorticoid therapy  
  
**Epidural anesthesia:** Has been used safely on obstetric patients for labor analgesia and cesarean section delivery.  
**Spinal anesthesia:** Has been used safely for TURPS  
**Intravenous and inhalation agents:**  
\- IV or inhalational may be used safely as long as the denervation of the heart is appreciated.  
\- Inhalation anesthetics all share a common dose-dependent myocardial depressant properties and various degrees of autonomic excitation and inhibition.**  
  
General anesthesia:  
****To** **reduce the risk of hypotension during induction:**  
\- Ensuring that intravascular volume (preload) status.  
\- Etomidate (does not decrease SVR) or low slow dose of propofol  
\- Administering a direct-acting vasopressor  
\- Carefully titrated inhalation agent or continuous intravenous infusion of any agent known vasodilatory properties  
  
**Ketamine for induction:** Lacks adequate literature  
\- A denervated heart lacks the direct nerve supply that would normally respond to the sympathetic stimulation caused by ketamine.  
\- In these cases, the direct cardiac depressant effects of ketamine may be more prominent.
