Tinzaparin (Innohep)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Tinzaparin (Innohep)

Low Molecular Heparin (LMWH)  
**Antidote:** Tinzaparin (half-life of 3.9 hrs): 1mg of protamine sulfate for every 100 units of  
Tinzaparin given in previous 8 hours.  
_Protamine does not completely neutralize anti-Xa activity (maximum about 60%)._  
  
**Non Urgent Procedure  
**Hold day of procedure Once-daily regimens or may consider ½ dose day prior to procedure.  
  
**Twice-daily regimens:** Hold evening dose day prior and morning of procedure.  
  
**Monitor:** Usually not monitored, but may check Anti-XA levels.  
Therapeutic qD dosing: 0.85.  
aPTT can also be used with reversing.  
  
**Bleeding Time:** Usually not effected, but clotting time is.  
**aPTT:** Prolonged  
**PT:** maybe slightly prolonged.

**_Note - Fondaparinux (Arixtra)_** _is an anticoagulant that shares the same pentasaccharide sequence as UFH and LMWH for the binding to antithrombin, however it has no extra chain and thus, is not considered a heparin product. It is also known to not cause HIT, as seen with UFH and LMWH._  
  
_Waiting time with regional anesthesia depend of BID vs TID._  
  
_Waiting time with_ Tinzaparin _and regional anesthesia depends on dose and frequency (TID or BID)._

| Minimal Time between  
last dose and neuraxial procedure | Can it be given with  
epidural catheter  
in place? | Restart after  
neuraxial procedure and/or  
catheter insertion | Restart after  
catheter removal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 12 hours | Yes  
Indwelling catheter is  
not considered a risk. | 12 hours from  
the first dose. | 12 hours form  
last dose.  
  
Next dose:  
No sooner than 24  
hours from the first dose. |

**Restart medication after procedure:** 24 hours, indwelling catheter should be removed before initiation of low LMWH treatment.  
**Daily:** May restart 6-8 hours after surgical procedure.  
**For BID:** May restart medication 24 hours after surgical procedure.  
**Remove catheter after last administration:** 10-12 hours.  
Second LMWH should be administered 24 hours after the first dose.  
  
Each 2 mL vial contains 20,000 anti-Factor Xa IU.  
For Sub Q injections only  
  
**Summary**  
A newly released, low molecular weight heparin product used in combination with warfarin for the treatment of acute deep venous thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolus.  
  
**Indications**  
For the treatment of acute symptomatic deep vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism when administered in conjunction with warfarin sodium.  
**  
Mechanism of Action  
**It inhibits factor Xa, which catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin (Factor IIa).  
It also exerts inhibitory action on thrombin, which converts fibrinogen to fibrin.  
Inhibits reactions that lead to the clotting of blood including the formation of fibrin clots.  
Neither unfractionated heparin nor tinzaparin sodium have intrinsic fibrinolytic activity; therefore, they do not lyse existing clots.  
  
**Onset:** Plasma levels of anti-Xa activity increase in the first 2 to 3 hours following SC injection of tinzaparin sodium and reach a maximum within 4 to 5 hours.  
  
**Half-life:** longer with subcutaneous administration for all agents so may require monitoring with anti-Xa level (LMWH) every 3 hours with repeat protamine (decrease dose to 0.5mg increments though) for LMWH if bleeding continues.  
  
**_Metabolism_**  
Low molecular weight heparins are partially metabolized by desulphation and depolymerization.  
  
**Elimination:** Primarily renal  
The elimination half-life is 3–4 hours, based on anti-Xa activity.  
Patients with severe renal impairment showed a 24% reduction in tinzaparin sodium clearance; therefore, the drug should be administered with caution to patients with renal impairment.
