Fluid Maintenance   

## Fluid Maintenance

**Perioperative fluid requirement**  
Maintenance fluid 4-2-1  
For the first 10 kg of weight give 4cc/kg/hr  
For the second 10 kg, ADD 2cc/kg/hr  
For the remaining kg, add 1cc/kg /hr  
Example: A 35 kg child requires 40+20+15 =75 cc/kg/hr  
A 5 kg child requires only 5x4=20cc/kg/h

**Replacing Fluid Deficit**  
Maintenance fluid x hours NPO  
Half is replaced in the first hour of surgery  
Replace one quarter in the second hour  
Replace remaining quarter in the third hour

**Anesthesia Induced Hypotension Treatment Volume Doses**  
Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended: (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids: (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for severe hypotension/crises 20cc/kg

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic): 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation): 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases): 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC): >10 cc/kg/hr  
3rd Spacing: 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**Third space losses during surgery**  
Superficial procedures 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderate procedures 4-6 cc/kg/hr  
Major procedures 6-8cc/kg /hr
