_FEIBA is available as a lyophilized powder in a single-use vial containing nominally 500, 1,000 or 2,500 units per vial._  
  
**Preparation of FEIBA  
**FEIBA (NF) has been prepared from source plasma and/or fresh frozen plasma.  
Individual donations of human plasma are combined to form plasma pools.  
Prior to being used for manufacture of FEIBA, each plasma pool is tested for the presence of genome sequences of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2), hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Parvovirus B19 (B19V) using PCR.  
  
**For Admistration:**  
Allow the vial of FEIBA and Sterile Water for Injection (diluent) to reach room temperature. Remove the plastic caps from the concentrate and diluents vials. Gently swirl (do not shake) the vial until FEIBA is completely dissolved. Make sure that FEIBA has been dissolved completely; otherwise, active material will not pass through the device filter. The reconstituted solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter before administration. The solution should be discarded if it is not clear or is discolored.
