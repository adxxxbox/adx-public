**Dalteparin (Fragmin) Reversal**

_Currently, there is a lack of specific antidotes for the growing number of new (novel) anticoagulants that are slowly replacing warfarin and heparin. For this reason, there is NO universal standard of care for the treatment of the anticoagulated bleeding patient when there is no specific antidote._

**Consult cardiology for ALL patients with coronary stents.**  
  
**Quick Notes  
**Dalteparin is a LMWH.  
**Dalteparin half-life:** 2.2 hours.  
  
**Subcutaneous injection:** half-life is prolonged.  
  
**Other LMWH all have similar reversal methods:  
**Enoxaparin  
Tinzaparin  
  
**Specific antidote:** Protamine, only partial.  
**Dalteparin and protamine doses:  
When last dose of dalteparin was within 8 hours:** 1mg protamine per 100 units.  
**When last dose of dalteparin was within 8-12 hours:** 0.5 mg protamine per 100 anti-Xa.  
  
Repeat dose 0.5 mg protamine for every 1 mg of 1mg enoxaparin given if bleeding continues or elevated anti‐factor Xa activity level after 2‐4 hours.  
  
**Low Molecular Weight Heparin Reversal of Bleeding (literature varies)  
**Protamine sulfate may be used as a partial reversal agent (neutralizes approximately 60% of LMWH’s anti‐ factor Xa activity).  
  
**Protamine Facts**  
Maximum single dose is 50mg.  
Never bolus - may result in profound HYPOtension.  
  
**LMWH Therapeutic Ranges (target anti-Xa levels measured 4 hours after dosing):**  
  
**Nonurgent**  
Hold dalteparin the day of procedure.  
**Once-daily regimens:** May consider ½ dose day prior to procedure.  
**Twice-daily regimens:** Hold evening dose day prior and morning of procedure  
  
**Urgent: No major bleeding  
**Wait 12-24 hours if possible.  
Consider protamine sulfate if a delay not possible for high bleeding risk procedures.  
  
**Life-threatening Bleed:  
**Hematology/Coagulation consult is recommended.  
Protamine sulfate  
Additional products may be needed to obtain hemostasis.  
PCCs  
  
rVIIa - no proven role.  
FFP - no proven role.  
  
**Dalteparin Ranges (target anti-Xa levels measured 4 hours after dosing):**  
Therapeutic Q day dosing 1.05  
  
**Lab Monitoring:  
**LMWHs are not routinely monitored.  
  
**AntiXa Activity (** antifactor Xa assay): Most reliable  
**Optional Labs:** PTT, ACT, or TEG  
**APTT:** Only slightly affected  
  
**AntiXa Activity (LMWXA) monitoring with LMWH (when needed)**  
If measuring is desired, check peak antiXa level 3-4 hours after dose.  
Observed peak AntiXa levels for Q12h dosing of LMWHs = 0.5-1 units/mL.  
Observed peak antiXa levels for Q24h dosing of LMWHs = 1-2 units per mL.  
  
You can also check trough antiXa levels prior to the next dose = < 0.5 units/mL.  
  
Elevated troughs suggest impaired clearance.  
  
aPTT displays a linear dose-respone to LMWH but, there is still variations.  
  
**Protamine Allergy**  
Increased risk of hypersensitivity reaction, including anaphylaxis, in patients with a fish allergy or prior exposure to protamine.  
Premedicate with corticosteroids and antihistamines if at risk for protamine allergy.  
  
**LMWH -** major bleeding occurs in 1-4% depending on dose and underlying condition.
