### Thrombolytic drugs / fibrinolytics

**Plasminogen activators**  
**r-tPA:** Alteplase, Reteplase and Tenecteplase  
**UPA:** (Saruplase, Urokinase)  
Anistreplase, Monteplace and Streptokinase  
  
**Other Serine Endopeptidases**  
Ancrod  
Brinase  
Fibrinolysin  
  
**Thrombolytics  
**Thrombolytics are medicines that may be used for the emergency treatment to break down newly formed clots (thrombi) which resulted in an ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or a massive pulmonary embolism. They may also be used for other indications.   
  
Thrombolytics break up clots by activating fibrinolysis and converting plasminogen to plasmin which lyses the clot. This allows blood and oxygen to re-perfuse the area, limiting tissue damage.  
  
Thrombolytics are more effective if initiated as soon as possible after the event (such as a heart attack, stroke, or PE) but can be given within three hours of symptom onset for a stroke, or within 12-24 hours of symptom onset for a heart attack.  
  
Major bleeding, including bleeding into the brain, is the most common risk associated with thrombolytics.  
  
**3 major classes of fibrinolytic drugs:**  
Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)  
Streptokinase (SK)  
Urokinase (UK)  
  
While drugs in these three classes all have the ability to effectively dissolve blood clots, they differ in their detailed mechanisms in ways that alter their selectivity for fibrin clots.
