**MAC Requirement  
****_Pregnancy overall decreases MAC requirements  
(administer lower doses)  
_**  
_This may be secondary to the high levels of progesterone and possibly an increase in B endorphin levels. There is a similar increase in sensitivity to opioids, sedatives, and local anesthetics.  
_**Less Succinylcholine  
**Less circulating plasma cholinesterase means less succinylcholine is required. Normal doses may have a prolonged effect.  
  
**Be careful of other protein bound drugs  
**Less circulating albumin  
  
**Inhalation Agents  
**Studies show that Isoflurane requirements are reduced by 28-30% during pregnancy.  
It is safe to assume that Sevoflurane and Desflurane may be similar.  
Epidural vein engorgement reduces the available CSF space.  
This can exaggerate the spread of a spinal anesthetic.  
Less local anesthetic is required for spinals and epidurals compared to a nonpregnant patient.  
  
**Spinal and Epidurals**  
Vena caval compression results in distension of the epidural venous plexus, increasing the risk of intravascular injection during regional blockade. The capacity of the epidural space is reduced, which probably contributes to the enhanced spread of local anesthetics in pregnancy.  
  
**Neuraxial Doses**  
Local anesthetics are enhanced secondary to mechanical factors within the epidural and subarachnoid space. The two spaces become smaller secondary to the engorged veins and thus less volume is required.  
Therefore, an identical volume of local anesthetic will spread more extensively in the pregnant patient than in a nonpregnant patient.  
  
These patients are more prone to "Blood Taps" with epidurals.
