### Breast Flap Options

**The TUG flap and SGAP/IGAP flaps**  
Generally used with patients who lack enough abdominal tissue for the TRAM, DIEP or SIEA flap.  
  
**Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator (DIEP) Flap:**  
Replacing the TRAM Flap. Uses tissue from the lower abdomen.  
The most advanced form of breast reconstruction currently available.  
  
Unlike the TRAM flap, the DIEP flap preserves all the abdominal muscles. Only abdominal skin and fat are removed, similar to a "tummy tuck." Patients experience less pain after surgery because of this, enjoy a faster recovery and maintain their abdominal strength.  
  
**Superficial Inferior Epigastric Artery (SIEA) Flap**  
The flap is taken from the abdomen to create a new breast.  
This method includes skin, fat and an artery and vein attached to the tissue flap so that it can be supplied with blood when it is transplanted to the chest. No abdominal muscle will be cut or moved during either process.  
  
**Transverse Upper Gracilis (TUG) Flap**  
Uses tissue from the inner thigh and underlying gracilis muscle.  
  
The medial thigh serves as an excellent reconstructive alternative for women who have a natural deposition of fat in this region. With blood supply provided by vessels from the medial femoral circumflex system, this flap captures the soft tissue from the upper, inner thigh, as well as the underlying gracilis muscle, an expendable muscle residing in the medial thigh.  
  
Advantages of this flap include minimal donor-site morbidity and a concealed scar. Furthermore, the semicircular shape of the transverse upper gracilis flap permits final shaping of the flap in a conical fashion, similar to that of the native breast. As with abdominal flaps, the adipose tissue of the inner thigh is soft and resembles the texture of the native breast.  
  
**Buttocks (Gluteal Flap)  
**A gluteal flap is a free flap procedure that takes tissue (possibly including muscle) from the buttocks and is transplanted transplants it to the chest area. A gluteal flap may be an option for women who prefer tissue reconstruction but don't have enough extra tissue in their backs or abdomens for those to serve as the tissue donor sites.  
  
**TRAM Flap**  
Breast Reconstruction Using a Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous Flap  
(either a pedicle or free flap type–transverse rectus abdominis muscle \[Tram\] Graft)  
Layman’s terms: “Tummy Tuck" Breast Reconstruction. Skin, fat and muscle are tunneled from the abdomen up to the chest and used to create a breast mound.  
  
**Two methods:** free flap or a pedicle flap, in which the proximal portion remains attached to the rectus abdominis muscle that provides the blood supply.  
Usually immediately follows a bilateral mastectomy as a single procedure.  
The TRAM flap can be used for reconstructing one or both breasts.
