### Protamine

**Heparin Antidote**  
  
**Dose:** For heparin reversal: 1-1.3mg of protamine per 100 units of heparin. However, this often results in protamine excess.  
  
Protamine administered rapidly is often associated with a drop in BP due to mild to moderate vasodilation and mild negative inotropic effects.  
  
It should be gradually administered over 5-15 minutes.  
  
Follow your institution’s procedures and common practices. The surgeon may wish to be notified when half the dose of heparin has been administered.  
  
**Protamine and pulmonary hypertension:**  
Patient should pay special attention to a history of pulmonary hypertension. Severe pulmonary hypertension after protamine neutralization of heparin is an infrequent but life-threatening event following cardiopulmonary bypass. Pulmonary vasodilators and the return to CPB is the standard corrective treatment.  
  
Protamine is a strong base. When combined with heparin (an acid), the anticoagulant effect is neutralized by the formation of a salt.  
The pH is protamine is between 6 and 7.  
Heparin pH is 5.0 to 7.5.  
Heparin is a strong acid forming salts when combined with a base.  
  
**Protamine:**  
Used in a long-acting formulation of insulin.  
Neutralizes the anticoagulant effects of heparin.  
Originally isolated from the sperm heads of salmon and other species of fish.  
  
Protamine is eliminated from the plasma considerably faster than heparin, so free protamine is less likely to be present longer than free heparin. This can lead to **heparin rebound.**  
  
**Heparin Rebound**  
The rapid clearance of protamine leaves unbound heparin remaining after protamine clearance. Treatment is to give more protamine.  
  
**Heparin rebound** usually occurs several hours after heparin has been adequately neutralized by protamine sulfate but has been reported 0.5 to 18 hours following cardiopulmonary bypass procedure.  
  
The heparin-protamine complex is eliminated by the reticuloendothelial system.  
  
Modern protamine manufacture involves recombinant biotechnology.  
  
In the presence of fish allergy, Protamine can cause significant histamine release resulting in hypotension and bronchoconstriction.  
  
In large doses, protamine itself has some anticoagulant effect.  
  
**Adverse effects:**  
Possible severe hypotension.  
Cardiovascular collapse.  
Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  
Catastrophic pulmonary vasoconstriction.  
Pulmonary hypertension with rapid IV injection, high doses, repeated doses, or previous exposure to protamine or protamine-containing drugs (e.g., insulin).  
  
**Other possible risk factors:**  
Known sensitivity to fish.  
Vasectomy.  
Severe left ventricular dysfunction.  
Abnormal pulmonary hemodynamics.  
Neutralization of anticoagulant effect of heparin.  
  
**Protamine in patients who have undergone vasectomy.**  
  
Nucleoprotamines are a normal component of human sperm cells. Antibodies against these protamines develop in 22 to 33% of patients undergoing elective vasectomy. These antibodies, in turn, have been shown to cross-react with medicinal protamines, which are extracted commercially from the testes of salmon and certain other fish.  
  
This cross-reactivity against protamines raises the possibility that patients who have undergone elective vasectomy may be at increased risk of an allergic reaction developing if they are later exposed to protamine as a medication.  
  
Anaphalactiod response to protamine or protamine-heparin complex is rare.
