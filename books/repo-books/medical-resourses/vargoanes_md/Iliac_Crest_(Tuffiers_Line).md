### Iliac Crest (Tuffier’s Line)

“Tuffier’s” line is a line drawn across the iliac crest that crosses the body of L4 or L4-L5 interspace. It is defined as a horizontal line connecting the superior aspect of the posterior iliac crests. This is a helpful landmark for the placement of spinal or epidural anesthetics.
