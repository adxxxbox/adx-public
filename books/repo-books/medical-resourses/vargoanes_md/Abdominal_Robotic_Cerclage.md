### Abdominal Robotic Cerclage

Also called transabdominal robotic cerclage  
Transabdominal robotic cerclage is a type of transabdominal cerclage (TAC).  
Robotic TAC has similar favorable obstetric outcomes to traditional laparotomy and it allows easier broad ligament dissection, visualization of the vasculature, and knot tying.  
  
The first ever robot-assisted abdominal cerclage using the da Vinci robot was performed in 2007.  
**Indications for transabdominal cerclage (TAC) via laparoscopy:  
**When a vaginal cerclage has failed in the past  
Cervix is too short to perform cerclage vaginally  
When the vaginal approach is not possible**  
  
Cervical cerclage:**  
Cervical cerclage procedure is for the management of an incompetent (insufficient) cervix.  
The surgeon performs a purse-string suture to cinch the cervix shut at the level of the internal os.  
The vaginal approach is currently still the gold standard for cerclage at the level of the internal os.  
**Incompetent cervix** often results in preterm delivery or miscarriage.  
  
This procedure may be performed on a parturient or prior to pregnancy if a patient has a history of an incompetent cervix.  
TAC is perceived to have better outcomes and more pregnancies carried to term.  
  
**TAC is permanent,** and the parturient will require a cesarian section.  
  
**Anesthesia:** General/ETT  
Consider RSI and aspiration precautions if the patient is pregnant.  
**If pregnant:** Avoid nitrous oxide and midazolam (Versed®).  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**Position:** Steep Trendelenburg with arms tucked  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV:** 20G is sufficient  
**OGT:** Consider it due to steep Trendelenburg  
**Ventilation:** Consider positive pressure ventilation due to the limitations of lung expansion resulting from a cephalad shift in abdominal contents against the diaphragm.  
  
**Possible complications:**  
Premature labor, if pregnant  
Premature rupture of membranes (TOM), if pregnant  
Cervical infection  
Chorioamnionitis (infection of the amniotic sac), if pregnant  
Cervical rupture  
Uterine rupture  
Injury to the cervix or bladder  
Bleeding
