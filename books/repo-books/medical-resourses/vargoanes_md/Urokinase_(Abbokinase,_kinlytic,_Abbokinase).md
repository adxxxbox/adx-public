### Urokinase (Abbokinase, Kinlytic)

**Thrombolytic (clot buster)  
****Urokinase** is an enzyme (protein) produced by the kidneys and found in the urine.  
Acts on the endogenous fibrinolytic system.  
Like tPA, it converts plasminogen to the enzyme plasmin. Plasmin degrades fibrin clots as well as fibrinogen and some other plasma proteins.  
  
_Newer drugs with a shorter half-life are usually preferred over Urokinase.  
__Primarily indicated only for patients allergic to Streptokinase._  
  
**Indications:**  
Urokinase is used for the treatment of pulmonary embolisms.  
The effectiveness of thrombolytics (“clot busters”) is inversely related to the time elapsed since the thrombic crisis began these drugs are most effective within **6 hours of onset of symptoms.**  
  
**Lab monitoring:  
****Thrombin time (TT):** a systemic administration, a 3 to 5 fold 4 hours after initiation of therapy is generally considered sufficient.  
However, results of coagulation tests and fibrinolytic activity do not reliably predict either efficacy or risk of bleeding.  
  
Plasma fibrinogen may be useful.  
Bleeding time and fibrin/fibrin degradation product (FDP/fdp) titer.  
May increase PT, PTT, and INR.  
May decrease hematocrit  
  
**Contraindications:  
**Recent surgery (10 days)  
GI bleeding (3 months)  
History of hypertension (diastolic > 110 mmHg)  
Pregnancy aortic dissection |  
Active bleeding or hemorrhagic disorder.  
Previous cerebrovascular accident  
Acute pericarditis or active intracranial process  
  
**Metabolism:** Proteolysis-Liver  
  
**Elimination:**  
Small fractions of the administered dose are excreted in bile and urine.  
  
Urokinase administered by intravenous infusion is rapidly cleared by the liver with an  
**Elimination half-life:** 12.6 ± 6.2 minutes  
Endogenous urokinase-type plasminogen activator plasma levels are elevated 2- to 4-fold in patients with moderate to severe cirrhosis.  
Thus, reduced urokinase clearance in patients with hepatic impairment might be expected.  
  
Urokinase-like TPA, is used clinically as a thrombolytic agent in the treatment of severe or massive deep venous thrombosis,  pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and occluded intravenous or dialysis cannulas.  
  
**Urokinase and** **Neuraxial or Deep Regional Block**

| Minimal Time between last dose and neuraxial procedure | Can it be given with  
epidural catheter in place? | Restart after neuraxial procedure and/or catheter insertion | Restart after catheter removal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avoid  
Insufficient clear data  
  
Consider assessing clotting studies and fibrinogen at 48 hours after last dose.  
  
Other source: 48 hours | No | Insufficient data.  
Not until fibrinogen level has recovered.  
  
Other source:  
10 days without catheter. | Insufficient data.  
Not until fibrinogen level has recovered.  
  
Other source: No sooner than 10 days after initial dose. |

**Restart medication after procedure:** No recommendations, avoid with an indwelling catheter.  
**Remove catheter after last administration:** No recommendations, check Fibrinogen level, one of the last clotting factors to recover.
