Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) (Total Hip Replacement)     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) (Total Hip Replacement)

**The new hip that replaces the old one is made up of these parts:**  
A socket, which is usually made of strong metal.  
A liner, which fits inside the socket. It is usually plastic, but some surgeons are now trying other materials, like ceramic and metal. The liner allows the hip to move smoothly.  
A metal or ceramic ball that will replace the round head (top) of the femur.  
A metal stem that is attached to the femur to make the joint more stable.

Then the surgeon must repair the muscles and tendons around the new joint.

  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT.  
**Regional:** Spinal or Epidural.  
Remember-a Spinal means less EBL!  
Many patients get both a spinal and an ETT; or a Spinal with a NC and a Propofol infusion. The patients are usually in the lateral position; so you will need a good airway if you want to use a NC.  
**Duration:** 1-3 hours.  
**Position:** Lateral  
**EBL:** 200-900mLs.  Varies with surgeons.  
**Cell Saver:** Sometimes but rarely utilized.  
**Duration:** 1.5 -3 hours.  
**IV Access:** 1-2 18G  
**Neo Drip:** usually  
**Blood Type and Screened:** Yes  
**Administer Tranexamic Acid:** Usually 20mg/kg after induction to decrease blood loss. Depends on the surgeon. Many surgeons still don’t order this drug.  
**Foley Catheter:** Yes  
**A-Line:** Usually not, but many still do.  
  
**Possible Complications:**  
Excessive blood loss.  
Intraoperative femoral shaft fracture.  
Intra-op cementless fracture.  
Complications related to cement Methyl-methacrylate.  
DVT  
Wound Infection.  
Hematoma  
Vascular injury to iliac vessels.  
Femoral/sciatic nerve injury.  
Urinary retention.  
  
Around 2% of these procedures will fail after three years.  
**Other Notes:** The surgeon makes the incision and will cut and remove the head of the femur, clean out the hip socket (acetabulum) and remove the rest of the cartilage and damaged or arthritic bone.

The surgeon will then insert the new hip socket in place and a metal stem into the femur. Then he will size and place the correct-sized ball for the new joint. After securing all of the new parts in place, cement will be placed.   

The hip joint is made up of two major parts. One or both parts may be replaced during surgery:  
The hip socket: a part of the pelvic bone called the acetabulum.  
The upper end of the thighbone or femoral head.
