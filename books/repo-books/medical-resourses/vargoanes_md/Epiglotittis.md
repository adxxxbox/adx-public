Epiglottitis   

### Epiglottitis (supraglottitis)

Because of widespread vaccination against _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b (or Hib) since 1985, epiglottitis has been almost eradicated in children. Today, more cases occur in adults, although there is an increase in children under one year.

**Epiglottitis** (“epi”-meaning “above” the glottis) is an acute bacterial infection of the epiglottis and surrounding tissues that may lead to severe airway obstruction and death

**Etiology (all bacterial)**  
_Haemophilus influenzae_ type B  
_Branhamella catarrhalis_  
_Klebsiella pneumonia**e**_  
_Streptococcus pneumoniae  
Streptococcus_ A,B and C  
_Varicella zoster_  
_Herpes simplex_~virus~type 1  
  
**Other possible causes:  
**Burns from hot liquids, chemicals or trauma.

**It may also involve the three structures below resulting in airway obstruction:**  
Arytenoid  
False cords  
Posterior tongue

**Age range:** usually 2-5 year of age  
**Acute:** yes  
**Fever:** yes, 104F (40C)  
**Throat pain:** yes  
**Course:** Rapid progress of symptoms

**Other Symptoms:**  
Sitting-leaning forward to breath and using accessory muscles  
Salivation-Drooling  
Difficulty swallowing  
Tachypnea  
Children may be sitting up in a "sniffing position" with the body leaning forward and the head and nose tilted forward and upward.

**Location:** Epiglottis and adjacent supraglottic structures

**Treatment**

Corticosteroids and epinephrine are used, but there is no good evidence these medications are helpful in cases of epiglottitis.  
Keep the child calm  
Remain in sitting position  
Immediate intubation to secure the airway  
β-lactamase–resistant antibiotic, such as ceftriaxone (Rocephin)  
  
Most people begin to recover within 24 to 48 hours after receiving antibiotics.  
Keep a parent in attendance to prevent separation anxiety.  
Oxygen.  
  
**Diagnosis:  
**Neck X-ray- Enlarged epiglottis (thumb sign) and distention of the hypopharynx.  
Laryngoscopy is the best way to confirm the diagnosis of epiglottitis, but this should not be done outside the operating room or where an immediate airway can be obtained.
