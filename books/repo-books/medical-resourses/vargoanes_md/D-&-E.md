### D & E (Dilation and Evacuation)

Therapeutic Abortion (TAB)  
A minor surgical procedure which involves mechanically opening (dilating) the cervix and evacuating the uterus.

**Indications**  
**Missed abortion:** The embryo or fetus dies, but no bleeding or cervical opening occurs.  
**Inevitable abortion:** The embryo or fetus dies, and painful or heavy bleeding occurs. If tissue from the pregnancy remains in the uterus after miscarriage, it can cause heavy bleeding or infection. The D&E aims to avoid this.

**Elective abortion:** Still legal in many states. Make sure you know your facility’s policies about this type of procedure. And just a note here: Be a professional about your job in these cases. If you have a religious conviction about elective abortions, then ask a colleague to do the case and you can do their procedure-this is common. There are some hospital employees who refuse to participate in these cases. If your policy allows it and you object, speak up before you meet the patient.

**WARNING:** Most of these patients are pretty depressed. Be sympathetic with them. Especially the patient’s who just had a miscarriage.  
**Pre-op:** Find out how many weeks the patient was pregnant. If they are a fairly new pregnancy, you do not need aspiration precautions.  
**Anesthetic:** MAC or General/LMA  
**Regional (Rare):** Surgeon may opt to perform a paracervical block or spinal.  
If the surgeon says it will be quick, you might consider a deep MAC. Inserting an LMA is much easier. For a MAC case, the OR staff will wait for you to put the patient to sleep before they lift the patient’s legs for lithotomy position.  
**Popular cocktail:** 2mg versed, 100mcgs Fentanyl with a Propofol infusion. If the patient’s airway looks difficult, just use an LMA. Most of the time it is easier just to go general and to slide in an LMA.  
**Duration:** 10-30 minutes  
**Position:** Lithotomy, arms out and slight Trendelenburg.  
Do your charting quickly because some of these procedures can be pretty fast. These women are of child bearing age so consider giving the Zofran / Decadron to prevent PONV.  
**Dx:** Usually missed abortion.  
**Blood Loss:** 10-40mLs; but I have seen 200-300mLs blood loss in 90-120 seconds.  
**Post-op cramps:** Usually, so consider Ofirmev and/or Toradol.  
Ofirmev is becoming the favorite.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
**Ultra Sound and full bladder:** For a pregnancy > 12 weeks, an ultra sound is usually utilized. A partially full bladder moves the bowel out from the pelvis into the abdomen, helping visualize the uterus. Consider a 500cc bolus if you find out the patient voided right before surgery.

**Possible Complications**  
Bleeding  
Perforated uterus  
Blood clots in the uterus  
Cervical laceration  
Infection

**Note:** It’s rare, but sometimes there will be more bleeding and the surgeon may ask for one of the 3 meds below.  
**Hemabate (Carboprost Tromethamine)**  
Standard dose-250mcg IM  
**Methergine (methylergonovine)**  
Standard Dose: 0.2mg IM  
**Pitocin (Oxytocin)**  
Standard Dose: 20 units IV

**More Notes**  
A device called a cervical (osmotic) dilator is often inserted in the cervix 24 hours before the procedure to help slowly open (dilate) the cervix. Dilating the cervix reduces the risk of any injury to the cervix during the procedure.

Misoprostol or Cytotec may also be given several hours before surgery. This medicine can help soften the cervix.  
The surgeon will grasp the cervix with an instrument to hold the uterus in place. Then the surgeon will dilate the cervical canal with probes of increasing size. An abortion in the second trimester will need the cervix to be dilated more than is required for a vacuum aspiration. Then a hollow tube (cannula) will be passed into the uterus. The cannula is attached by tubing to a bottle and a pump that provides a gentle vacuum to remove tissue in the uterus. Some cramping is felt during the rest of the procedure. The surgeon will pass a grasping instrument (forceps) into the uterus to grasp larger pieces of tissue. This is more likely in pregnancies of 16 weeks or more and is done before the uterine lining is scraped with a curette.
