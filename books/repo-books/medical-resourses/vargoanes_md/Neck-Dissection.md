### Neck Dissection- Radical or Modified

True Radical Neck dissections (the surgeon removes everything) are rarer now thanks to other conservative surgeries combined with chemo/radiation.  
Modified: The surgeon removes much less and many of these patients do not require an A-line or tracheostomy.  

**What is a neck dissection?**  
When the surgeon removes lymph nodes and other structures in the head and neck that are likely or proven to be malignant. Variations on neck dissections exist depending on the extent of the cancer.

**What structures MAY be removed:**  
Lymph Nodes  
Sternocleidomastoid muscle  
Internal Jugular Vein  
Larynx per a laryngectomy  
Part of the tongue  
Pharynx  
Submandibular gland  
Spinal accessory nerve  
Tumor  

The goal is always to remove all the cancer but to save as many components surrounding the nodes as possible.

There are around 600 lymph nodes in the body, and 200 are located in the neck. Only a small number of these are removed during a neck dissection. Some patients still end up with a tracheostomy.

You need to find out from the surgeon what he is going to remove ahead of time. If he is NOT entering the larynx, that usually means no tracheostomy procedure.

**Anesthesia**: General/ETT. Tape the ETT to the opposite side of where the surgeon stands.  
**Muscle relaxant:** Check with the surgeon.  
**Position:** Supine with arms tucked. The bed may be rotated 90-180 degrees. Make sure you have anesthesia circuit slack for your tubing.  
**A-line:** for a Radical: yes. For a Modified radical: not as common.  
**EBL:** Potential for large **EBL** from the Internal Jugular or Carotid Artery, but usually very little.  
**Blood available:** Yes, the patient should be typed and crossed.  
**NG Tube:** usually, just asks the surgeon. Some surgeons will let you pass it, empty the stomach and then remove it before the surgery begins.  
**Duration:** 2-5 hours.  

**Possible Complications**

The greatest risk is damage to the nerves, muscles, and veins in the neck. Nerve damage can result in numbness (either temporary or permanent) to different regions on the neck and loss of function (temporary or permanent) to parts of the neck, throat, and shoulder.

The more extensive the neck dissection, the more function the patient is likely to lose. As a result, it is common following radical neck dissection for a person to have stooped shoulders, limited ability to lift the arm, and limited head and neck rotation and flexion due to the removal of nerves and muscles.

**Other risks**: Potential bleeding and infection.

**More Notes**: Cancers of the head and neck (sometimes inaccurately called throat cancer) often spread to nearby tissues and into the lymph nodes. Removing these structures is one way of controlling the cancer.

There are around 600 lymph nodes in the body, and 200 are located in the neck. Only a small number of these are removed during a neck dissection.
