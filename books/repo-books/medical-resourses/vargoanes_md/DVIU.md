### DVIU (Direct Vision Internal Urethrotomy)

A surgery to repair a urethral stricture. A small scope is placed into the urethra, and a cut is made in the stricture. In most cases a Foley catheter is inserted and will remain in place for 2 days to 2 weeks. A Urethral stricture is due to scarring of the urethra. This scarring may be caused by infection or injury. DVIU cuts through the scar tissue and opens the urethra. Many of these cases are done in the doctor’s office.  
**Anesthetic:** Deep Mac or General/LMA.  
**Duration:** 5-10 minutes  
**IV Access:** 22G is acceptable  
**Position:** Lithotomy  
**EBL:** Minimal  
  
**More Notes:**  
The surgery is usually only a temporary relief. Success is less than 9% for the first or subsequent urethrotomies. Most patients will be expected to experience failure with longer follow up and the expected long-term success rate from any urethrotomy approach is very low. A urethroplasty is becoming the treatment of choice for patients who fail 2 successive urethrotomies.
