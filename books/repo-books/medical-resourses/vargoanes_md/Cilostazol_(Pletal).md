### Cilostazol (Pletal®)

Phosphodiesterase type 3 Inhibitor  
Cilostazol reversibly inhibits platelet aggregation-meaning NOT the life-span of the platelets.  
  
Cilostazol being a Phosphodiesterase type 3 Inhibitor is also **direct arterial vasodilator**  
to increase blood flow to the legs and decreasing platelet coagulation-treating intermittent claudication.  
  
Cilostazol is a quinolinone derivative and cellular phosphodiesterase inhibitor, more specific for phosphodiesterase III (PDE III).  
  
**Coagulation Review Note:** An important mediator of the platelet activity is cyclic AMP (cAMP), which inhibits platelet aggregation.  
  
When Prostacyclin (PGI 2 ) is released by the endothelium, it activates platelet G s protein-linked receptors. This, in turn, activates adenylyl cyclase, which synthesizes cAMP.  
An increase in cAMP INHIBITS platelet activation by decreasing cytosolic levels of calcium and, by doing so, inhibits the release of granules that would lead to activation of additional platelets and the coagulation cascade.  
  
**Mechanism of Action -** Exact mechanism is unknown.  
Cilostazol and its metabolites probably inhibits PDE III activity, thereby suppressing cAMP degradation. This results in an increase in cAMP in platelets and blood vessels, leading to inhibition of platelet aggregation and vasodilation.  
  
**Laboratory Monitoring  
**Cilostazol is considered reliable and usually not monitored, unlike heparin and warfarin.  
Studies show when administered alone on healthy patients, there is little to no change in Bleeding Time, aPTT, PT and INR.  
  
**Potential side effects** (mostly from arterial dilation)  
Tachycardia  
Palpitation  
Tachyarrhythmia  
Hypotension.  
**  
Indications of Cilostazol**  
For the reduction of symptoms of intermittent claudication, as demonstrated by an increased walking distance. The typical dose is 100 mg BID  
The effects may take as long as 3 months to be evident and has been shown to improve pain-free walking distance by 50%.  
  
Cilostazol is also frequently used off-label, at the same dose, for treatment of intracranial atherosclerosis and secondary stroke prevention.  
  
**Metabolism:** by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, two isoenzymes of the cytochrome P450 system. with metabolites largely excreted in urine.  
  
**Metabolites:** Two metabolites are active, with one metabolite appearing to account for at least 50% of the pharmacologic (PDE III inhibition) activity after administration of PLETAL.  
  
**Drug Interactions**  
Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4, such as itraconazole, erythromycin, ketoconazole, and diltiazem, are known to  interact with cilostazol. The proton pump inhibitor omeprazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP2C19, increases exposure to the active  metabolite of Cilostazol.  
  
**Excretion:** 74% renal, 20 % fecal  
**Half-life:** 10 hours  
_The platelet aggregation returns to normal within 96 hours of stopping Cilostazol._  
  
**Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal  
impairment - SCr <= 2.5 mg/dL)  
  
**Hepatic Impairment**  
The pharmacokinetics of cilostazol and its metabolites were similar in subjects with mild hepatic disease as compared to healthy subjects.

**Restart medication after procedure:** Within 24 hours.  
**Remove catheter after administration: 42 hours post last dose of.**  
  
Consider extending time prior to catheter placement in patients with renal impairment half-life 11-13 hours.  
  
**Contraindications:** In patients with heart failure of any severity.  
Cilostazol and several of its metabolites are inhibitors of phosphodiesterase III. Several drugs with this pharmacologic effect have caused decreased survival compared to placebo in patients with class III-IV heart failure.
