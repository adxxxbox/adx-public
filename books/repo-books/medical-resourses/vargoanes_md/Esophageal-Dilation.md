Esophageal Dilation     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Esophageal Dilation

There are several causes of blockage or stricture of the esophagus.  
They all can cause dysphagia, or difficulty in swallowing.  
Most of the dilations are performed in a GI Lab.  

**The dilatation is done with one of three types of dilators:**  
A balloon dilator  
A bougie dilator  
Rigid dilator

  As soon as the patient gets in the room, you need to put the NC (with ETCO2 detector) so the patient could build up a reserve while you are connecting the other monitors. Some GI labs are efficient with little time between the patient entering the room and the start of the procedure.  
**Equipment:** Appropriate size oral airway, suction and Ambu bag within arm’s reach.

Make sure the bite block is carefully inserted before you start giving them Propofol.

Make sure the patient is deep before the insertion of the dilator because it is very stimulating. The patient is more prone to a laryngospasm if they are too light.

**Anesthetic**: General; usually a Propofol Infusion. In addition to Propofol, some CRNAs give 2mg of Versed or combine the Versed with Ketamine.   
**Lidocaine bolus**: Yes, to try and prevent a laryngeal spasm.  
I’ve seen Versed given pre-op, and then a bolus of 20mg of Ketamine and 30mg of Propofol before the scope is initially inserted.  
**Bedside Meds:** Robinul, Atropine, Ephedrine and Anectine.  
**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**Position:** Head of bed up 25-30%. Most patients are in the left lateral position, while some are left in the supine position with their head flexed to the left.  
**Muscle relaxation:** Not needed  
**IV Access:** 22G is acceptable  
  
**An EGD is done before the dilation procedure.** A biopsy (tissue sample) may be taken and sent to lab for tests before the dilation.

**Airway issues:**  
Do not hesitate to manipulate the airway (jaw thrust) if the patient starts to obstruct during the procedure. Do not hesitate to tell the GI doc to pull out the endoscope if you can’t manage the airway.

Don’t feel bad, I could assure you it’s not the first time he/she has been asked this. The GI doc may continue when the SAO2 returns to normal.  
  
**Bite Block Removal**  
When the procedure is complete, do not remove the bite block until the patient can follow commands and open their mouth. You can damage the patient’s teeth by pulling the bite block out too soon.  
 

**Possible Complications**  
Laryngeal spasm while advancing the tube  
Esophageal perforation

  
**More Notes:  
A balloon dilator:** This is passed through the endoscope during the exam and then inflated in the esophagus.

**A bougie dilator**: Bougies are dilators made of soft rubber or polyurethane and filled with metal to make them heavy. They come is different diameter sizes. Usually no more than three dilators of increasing sizes are passed in a single procedure. The bougie may stay inserted for 5-15 seconds and are lubricated before they are passed. They are tapered on the distal end like a pencil.

**Rigid dilators:** These are made of hard plastic and positioned using a guide wire passed through the endoscope.

Dilation is done with the dilator or balloon in place. This may be repeated once or twice with larger dilators. The endoscope may be inserted again to place a stent, which is a tube to hold the esophagus open. A shot of steroid medicine may also be given in the distal esophageal walls to help prevent the area from getting narrow again.  
 Dilation is rarely associated with complications and is rarely contraindicated unless previous dilation attempts have been unsuccessful.

**Possible Causes of Esophageal Stricture**

**Peptic Acid Stricture**

Over time, the acid and peptic stomach juices injure the esophagus, causing inflammation and then scarring. The fibrous scar then contracts and narrows the esophageal opening. A Hiatal hernia makes it worse.

**Schatzki's Ring**  
A narrow ring of benign fibrous tissue constricting the lower esophagus.

**Ingestion of Caustic Agents**  
Children are particularly prone to swallowing liquid lye and other agents which can severely burn the esophagus, leaving it narrowed.  
  
**Achalasia:** A marked spasm of the lower esophageal muscle.

  
**Heredity Tumors:** The esophagus may be partially or completely blocked at birth.
