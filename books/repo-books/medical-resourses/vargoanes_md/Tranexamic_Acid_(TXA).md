Tranexamic Acid (TXA)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Tranexamic Acid (TXA)

**Documented doses for anticoagulated bleeding patients**

_Currently, there is a lack of specific antidotes for the growing number of new anticoagulants that are slowly replacing warfarin and heparin. For this reason, there is NO universal standard of care addressing treatment of an anticoagulated bleeding patient when there lacks a specific antidote.  
  
_

There has been a great increase in interest in the ability of tranexamic acid to reduce morbidity and mortality in surgical and traumatic bleeding.  
Tranexamic acid has been shown to reduce mortality due to traumatic bleeding by a third, without apparent safety issues.  
  
After aprotinin was taken off the market, TXA has been widely used to reduce bleeding in cardiac surgery and in other types of surgery.  
  
**TXA is safe to administer when in doubt**  
Corticosteroid randomization after significant head injury (CRASH-2) showed that TXA had no effect on the rate of venous thromboembolism providing reassuring evidence that it is safe to use in a trauma setting. In orthopedics, TXA is commonly administered prophylactically.  
  
_TXA is about 10 times more potent than Amicar (Mannucci 1998)  
  
_**Indications:** To prevent or treat excessive blood loss during surgery.  
In anesthesia, this drug is most commonly administered prophylactically for orthopedic procedures and trauma.  
  
TXA has only a few contraindications and a low record of adverse reactions which are related to thrombotic sequelae. Therefore, the many recommend that TXA should be considered as an option for reversal of bleeding in patients taking anticoagulants.  
  
TXA is commonly mentioned as an option for the early treatment and/or severe bleeding patients who are on newer anticoagulants WITHOUT specific antidotes, including those listed below.  
  
Rivaroxaban (Xarelto)  
Apixaban (Eliquis)  
Edoxaban (Savaysa)  
Dabigatran (Pradaxa, Pradax, Prazaxa)  
Abciximab (Reopro®)  
Bivalirudin (Angiomax)  
Clopidogrel (Plavix, Duoplavin)  
Prasugrel (Effient, Efient)  
Tirofiban (Aggrastat)  
Urokinase  
Vorapaxar Sulfate (Zontivity)  
  
**_Do NOT administer aPCC or other procoagulants with antifibrinolytics!_**  
  
Antifibrinolytics - aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid should not be used for approximately 6 to 12 hours after the administration of FEIBA or other potent procoagulants to reduce possible thromboembolic events.  
  
**Doses vary for reversal of bleeding with anticoagulants  
**15mg/kg bolus followed by 1mg/kg/hour until bleeding is controlled  
25mg/kg IV  
1 gram  
1gram IV stat and continue (maximum dose 15 mg/kg) every 6-8 hours  
1 gram infusion over 6 hours  
  
**Common Dose Recommendations of TXA** (reduced with renal dysfunction)  
**IV injection for fibrinolysis:** 0.5-1 gram BID or TID  
**Generalized hyperfibronolysis:** 1 gram (15 mg/kg) Q 6-8 hours  
**Cardiac surgery trials–loading or bolus dose:** ranged from 2.5-100mg/kg.  
**Cardiac surgery maintenance dose:** 0.25-4.0 mg/kg/hour over 1-12 hours  
Convulsive seizures after bypass have been reported with moderate (24mg/kg) to high  
doses (> 100mg/kg) (Kalavrouziotis et al. 2012: Koster et al. 2013).  
**Orthopedic Doses:** Range from 1 gram x 2 (before incision and closing) to just 20 mg/kg IV.  
**Trauma Protocols:** vary  
  
**Mechanism of Action  
**Inhibits fibrinolysis by inhibiting the binding of plasma to fibrin  
**Route of administration:** Oral (tablet or solution) and IV.  
**Half-life:** 2.3 hours.  
  
**TXA contraindications:**  
In patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, due to the risk of cerebral edema and cerebral infarction.  
In patients with active intravascular clotting (DIC).  
In patients with severe hypersensitivity reactions to tranexamic acid or any of the ingredients.  
  
**TXA is no longer contraindicated in patients with:**  
History of CVA/TIA  
Recent MI (within 1 year)  
Coronary vascular stent placed within six months to one year  
  
TXA should be used with caution in patients who are color blind since this prohibits measuring one endpoint that should be followed as a measure of toxicity.
