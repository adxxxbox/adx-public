## PRBCs Notes

**(For more blood products - refer to “Drug Box” link)**  
**_Note: Always remember that 30% of blood transfusion recipients get some type of infection._**

Packed RBCs, which is whole blood minus the plasma portion.  
Average volume-275mLs + or - 25mLs.  
Average HCT per bag: 60-80%.  
Only 70% of the RBCs in the bag remain viable upon transfusion.

**Goal:** To increase oxygen carrying capacity.  
1 Unit PRBC's usually increases Hct by 3% or Hb by 1g/dL.  
Should mix or flush PRBCs with NS, D5NS or Normosol.  
Avoid LR because the Ca ions in the LR may induce clotting.  
Always use a blood filter.  
Blood warmer is recommended.

**Indications For PRBCs via ASA**  
Recommended for <6g/dL  
Rarely needed for >10g/dL  
For 6-10g/dL, evaluate clinical evidence.

**Supporting Indications of Blood Transfusions**  
Uncontrolled or Active Hemorrhage.  
Tissue ischemia - i.e., shock (cardiac, muscle, visceral, etc).

**NOT Indicators**  
Anemia  
Arbitrary Hemoglobin measurement  
Decreased CO or BP

**  
Biggest Indicator**  
Intraoperative, unstable  
Active, uncontrolled hemorrhage.   
Tissue Ischemia-verified via lactate levels, pH, base deficit and increasing Creatinine.

**  
Hyperkalemia and Pack RBCs**  
Hyperkalemia is common after PRBC transfusion, and often severe with large rapid infusions.   
During storage, K+ moves out of RBCs to maintain electrochemical neutrality because of the hydrogen ions generated during storage redistribute. K+ can reach levels of 17-35mEq/L.  
Also from ruptured RBCs in the bag releases K.

**  
Dilutional Coagulopathy**  
70kg patient has 5L of Blood.  
1L crystalloid causes a 17% reduction in Hb.  
So starting Hb will go from 12g/dL down to 10g/dL.  
We usually give FFP and platelets if we transfuse 4-6 units of PRBCs.   
PRBC's have no coagulants or platelets. Administration of any large volumes will naturally dilute them.   
Diluted thrombocytopenia is not expected until the transfused blood volume exceeds 1.5 times the blood volume.

**Compared to Whole blood, PRBC has less:**  
Na and K+  
Ammonia  
Citrate  
Lactic acid  
Less plasma - so less allergic transfusion reactions.  
Kept in a refrigerator (1-6 degrees C) and is good for 42 days from the date of donation.  
A transfusion of one unit (one bag) of packed red blood cells ranges from $522 to $1,183.

**Additives to PRBCs**  
Citrate - phosphate dextrose preservative (CPDA-1)-this increases storage time.  
Adenine-increases RBC survival by allowing the cells to resynthesize ATP needed to fuel metabolic reactions.  
**Glucose:** To maintain glycolysis with prolonged storage time with adenine.  
**Adsol (adenine, glucose, mannitol and NaCl):** will increase storage time up to 42 days, but resulting Hct of the RBC's is only 55% rather than 70-80%.  
Expiration date of frozen PRBCs at 65 degrees C is 3 years.

**Warning**  
All transfusions cause some degree of harm in EVERY patient due to the physical properties of stored blood and because of impairments in immune system function.  
Anesthesia providers have become much more resistant to transfusing blood unless it is absolutely necessary.  
Lab values are no longer the #1 indicator for transfusing blood, unless they are extreme. The decision must be the specific patients needs.
