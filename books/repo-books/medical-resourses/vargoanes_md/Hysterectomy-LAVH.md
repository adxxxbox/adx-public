### Hysterectomy- Laparoscopic Assisted Vaginal (LAVH)

When the surgeon uses a laparoscope to guide the removal of the uterus and/or Fallopian tubes and ovaries through the vagina.  
Laparoscopically, the ligaments that support the uterus are cut and blood vessels are clamped, then the uterus is removed vaginally.  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**Position:** Lithotomy and Trendelenburg.  
**EBL:** 10-50  
**IV Access:** 20 G is acceptable

**Possible Complications**  
Bleeding  
Wound Infection  
Small bowel herniation

**More Notes:**  
**Laparoscopic Assisted Vaginal Hysterectomy (LAVH):**  
This technique allows better operative exposure, decreased blood loss, and decreased operative time. During a laparoscopic assisted procedure, the uterus is flipped on itself prior to finishing the hysterectomy, the vessels are clamped and blood loss is typically less versus the standard vaginal approach.
