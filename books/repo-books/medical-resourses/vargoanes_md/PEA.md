## PEA

PEA (Pulseless Electrical Activity)  
  
**PEA:  
**Any organized EKG rhythm WITHOUT a palpable pulse. It is the most common rhythm present after defibrillation.

**Heart Monitor with PEA  
**EKG reading is present  
Absent Pulse ox waveform  
Absent ETCO2

PEA and asystole make up half of the Cardiac Arrest Algorithm with VF and VT consisting of the other half.  
Unfortunately, patients with PEA usually have poor outcomes.

PEA used to be called electromechanical dissociation or EMD.

**Heart Monitor Display with PEA (in the OR)**  
EKG waveform still present  
Loss of pulse ox waveform  
Loss of ETCO2

Always immediately check a pulse or ventilator disconnect to confirm PEA.

**Treatment**  
Call for more anesthesia stat and a code cart  
Surgeon to stop operating  
Intubate (if not already intubated)  
100% O2 and manually ventilate  
Start chest compressions  
  
**Medications for PEA**  
Epinephrine: 1 mg IV every 3-5 minutes  
Vasopressin: 40 Units can be given IV to replace the first or second dose of epinephrine

_Identifying the underlying reversible cause is very important_

**Reversible Causes (H’s and T’s)  
**Hypovolemia  
Hypoxia  
H+ (acidosis)  
Hypokalemia or hyperkalemia  
Hypothermia

Toxins  
Tamponade (cardiac)  
Tension pneumothorax  
Thrombosis (pulmonary, coronary)
