### Vitamin K

Additional Information about warfarin reversal.

1.  Oral vitamin K is preferred for patients without severe bleeding.
2.  IV vitamin K should be ordered only if patient has life-threatening bleeding, or needs an emergent procedure, where a shorter onset of anticoagulation reversal may be required.
3.  Subcutaneous or intramuscular doses are not recommended as routine care.
4.  Full effect of vitamin K on warfarin reversal occurs approximately 24 hours after administration. Partial effects may be seen in 6‐12 hours.
5.  Doses of vitamin K greater than 10 mg are excessive and do not reverse anticoagulation more quickly.

**VKAs** inhibit the synthesis of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and anticoagulant proteins C and S.  
  
**Discontinued Warfarin and INR  
**With the discontinuation of warfarin, the INR can drop or approach normal levels in 1-3 days. This reflects the increase of factor VII activity.  
However, inadequate hemostasis remains possible despite a decreased INR because factor-II has a longer _T1/2_.  
  
**Vitamin K:** Leads to production of functional coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X previously depleted by warfarin.  
Vitamin K only works on VKAs; does not neutralize the activity of other non-VKA anticoagulants.  
  
**Vitamin K Onset  
PO:** 12-24 hours-for nonsignificant bleeding.  
**IV:** 4-12 hours-for significant bleeding  
(SC and IM) not recommended.  
  
**Absence of clinical bleeding:** IV Vitamin: K – may reverse to a normal INR within 6-8 hours.  
  
**Common IV Doses of Vitamin K (phytonadione)  
Severe Bleed:** 5–10 mg IV (usually 10mg) for severe bleeds with addition of FFP or a PCC.  
  
**Non-Urgent:  
Urgent but NOT immediate:** Patient may receive 10mg/day of Vitamin K.  
  
**PO Vitamin K**  
Higher home doses of warfarin may require higher doses of Vitamin K to achieve certain reduction in INR.  
Bridging therapy  
  
**Duration  
**Duration of vitamin K is dependent on warfarin intensity  
INR may rebound in occurring days.  
  
**Vitamin K is NOT enough when URGENT reversal is needed.**  
For urgent reversal, vitamin K administered alone is insufficient.  
The liver cannot quickly produce the lacking factors.  
In addition to Vitamin K, the missing factors must be replaced with either FFP or PPCs.  
  
**Vitamin K Doses for nonbleeding elevated INRs.  
INR 4.5-10: 1.25 mg Vitamin K PO  
**Continue with lower dose OR omit dose and resume therapy at lower dose when INR is in therapeutic range; if only minimally above therapeutic range, no dose reduction may be required. Routine use of vitamin K is not recommended.  
  
(INR should return to therapeutic range in 24-48 hours).**  
  
INR > 10: 2.5-5 mg Vitamin K PO  
**Hold warfarin and administer vitamin K 2.5 – 5 mg PO; administer additional vitamin K every 24 to 48 hours as needed; resume therapy at lower dose when INR is in therapeutic range.  
  
(INR should return to therapeutic range in 24-48 hours).  
  
**For Major Bleeding** Vitamin K 5-10 mg IV along with PCCs.
