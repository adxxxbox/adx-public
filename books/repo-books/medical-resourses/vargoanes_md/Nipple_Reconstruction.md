Nipple Reconstruction    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Nipple Reconstruction

This procedure is usually done 3 or 4 months after breast reconstruction surgery.  
  
Creating the nipple-areola complex is the final component making the breast reconstruction complete.  
  
**Various methods:** From skin taken as a local flap on the reconstructed breast, the surgeon will create a nipple mound. The areola can then be either tattooed, or it can be reconstructed with a skin graft taken from elsewhere on the body.  
  
**Anesthetic:** General, usually using LMA.  
**Position:** Supine with arms abducted.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable. IV and BP cuff placement should be on the arm opposite the side of axillary node dissection.  
  
Tissue to rebuild the nipple is usually taken from the patient’s chest wall or the upper inner thigh.  
  
**More Notes  
**The new nipple will not react to temperature or touch and will have no sensation.  
  
Depending on the type of breast reconstruction, these reconstructed nipples may appear more or less erect than normal breast nipples.  
**Nipple reconstruction using a dermal matrix product** (a skin substitute made mostly of collagen -- AlloDerm®, Strattice®, NeoForm®, and DermaMatrix® are examples).  
  
**A Nipple Tattoo:** Instead of using tissue to rebuild a nipple, some women choose to have a nipple tattooed on the reconstructed breast. Some women decide to have a star, a heart, or another meaningful image tattooed on the reconstructed breast instead of a nipple.  
  
**There are two types of nipple tattoos:** Dermabrasion and 3-D tattooing.  
  
**Dermabrasion nipple tattoos** use a high frequency vibrating probe to push pigment into the skin.  
  
**3-D nipple tattoos** are actual tattoos that use oscillating needles coated with pigment.
