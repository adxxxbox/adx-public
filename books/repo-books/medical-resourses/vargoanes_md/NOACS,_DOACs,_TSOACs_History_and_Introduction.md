### NOACS, DOACs, TSOACs History and Introduction

**NOAC -** Novel Oral Anticoagulant  
**DOAC -** Direct Oral Anticoagulant  
**TSOAC -** Target Specific Oral Anticoagulants  
  
**Introduction  
**Heparin and Warfarin have been the conventional anticoagulants for decades. Unfortunately, they both affect many coagulation factors that increase variability.  
  
**Heparin:** Inhibits factors Xa and to a lesser extent IIa. It also inhibits XIIa, XIa and IXa.  
Heparin is NOT administered orally, so it is excluded.  
  
**Warfarin** : An oral anticoagulant **–** inhibits the synthesis of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and anticoagulant proteins C and S.  
  
**The “novel” (new) oral anticoagulants are much more specific and only affect one factor.  
_The fewer clotting factors affected, the more reliable the anticoagulant, thus it does NOT need routine monitoring is not necessary._**  
  
Many experts prefer not to use the acronym "novel oral anticoagulant" and "new(er) oral anticoagulants" (NOAC) because over time each agent ceases to be novel or new.  
  
Some clinicians refer to this group of agents as **"non-vitamin** K antagonist oral anticoagulants", to retain the NOAC acronym.  
  
**Dabigatran – the original “novel” anticoagulant  
Dabigatran** was introduction to the US market in 2010.  
Dabigatran is considered reliable and is a Direct Thrombin Inhibitor (clotting factor IIa). It is one of the few that presently have an antidote. Dabigatran directly binds to clotting factor IIa (thrombin). This mechanism was novel for an oral anticoagulant and even for most parenteral anticoagulants.  
  
A year later, in 2011, **Rivaroxaban (Xarelto)** was approved by the FDA.  
Rivaroxaban only binds directly to clotting factor Xa.Over the next 4 years, 2 additional direct clotting factor Xa inhibitors **Apixaban** **(Eliquis)** and **Edoxaban (Savaysa)** were approved.  
  
New (novel) anticoagulants have been surfacing and have been proven to be more target-specific, reliable and require less monitoring. These drugs are slowly replacing warfarin.The negative aspect is that there are many new anticoagulants with few antidotes.  
  
**Anticoagulants that are considered NOACs:  
**Dabigatran (Pradaxa)  
Rivaroxaban (Xarelto)  
Apixaban (Eliguis)  
  
**Advantage of newer oral anticoagulants over warfarin  
**More reliable and do not need monitored  
Shorter half-lives  
  
**Disadvantages of newer oral anticoagulants over warfarin**  
More expensive **–** as are all newer drugs  
Most have no antidotes and thus treatment of acute hemorrhage becomes confusing an acute hemorrhage.  
Common lab monitoring using aPTT, PT and INR is NOT reliable.  
  
**History of the NOAC Concept**  
The term “novel” was initially applied to dabigatran (Pradaxa) when it was introduced to the US market in 2010. Instead of reducing clotting factor production (like warfarin) or binding to antithrombin III to induce anticoagulation (like heparin and heparin derivatives), dabigatran directly binds to clotting factor IIa (thrombin). This mechanism was novel for an oral anticoagulant and even for most parenteral anticoagulants.  
  
Several years later, these oral anticoagulants have ceased to be “novel.” Therefore, various organizations have proposed more durable names to refer to this important class of oral anticoagulants.  
  
**The “N” in NOAC  
**The newest CHEST guideline defines “novel” as “non-vitamin K antagonist” oral anticoagulants.  
Critics of the NOAC terminology cite that “non-vitamin K antagonist” contains several letters not captured in the acronym, and NOAC may be misunderstood to mean “NO Anticoagulants,” which could potentially be a life-threatening mistake.  
  
**Alternative Acronyms** – **DOACs (direct oral anticoagulant)**  
The most popular competing term is “DOAC,” which stands for direct oral anticoagulant. This terminology reflects the novel mechanism of the newer anticoagulants (directly binding to specific clotting factors), which may even reflect future oral anticoagulants that haven’t been developed, like those directly binding to other clotting factors (aside from Xa or IIa) within the clotting cascade.  
  
**International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) endorsed the acronym DOAC.**  
The ISTH was concerned about the acronym NOAC being misconstrued as “no anticoagulant,”so the ISTH adopted the acronym “DOAC” into their literature instead of “NOAC.”  
  
“OAC” means oral anticoagulant. NOAC, DOAC and TSOAC exclude warfarin and tend to overlap.  
As mentioned above, different organizations acquire different acronyms for the newer oral anticoagulants. Acronyms are frequently changed.
