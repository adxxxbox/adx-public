# Nitrous Oxide

**Nitrous Oxide (N2O)**  
**Class:** Inhalation Agent  
**Blood:** Gas Partition Coefficient: 0.46. Almost as fast acting as Desflurane.  
Poor blood solubility so has a fast onset/offset.  
**Mac:** 104%.  
MAC cannot be achieved at normal atmospheric pressure, but can in a hyperbaric chamber.  
More efficacious when given along with another inhalation agent.  
Masking N2O when needed (adjunct to IV narcotics) for a MAC case is still considered a MAC case.  
Good analgesic but causes minimal skeletal muscle relaxant.  
Decreases volatile anesthetic requirements.  
Very cheap.  
**Teratogenic:** Possibly-avoid with early pregnancy  
**Supports Combustion:** Yes  
Less myocardial depression than volatile agents.  
Related to PONV is always questioned.  
Nitrous will cause distensible gas spaces to distend (intestinal gas, pneumothorax, bleb and air embolism.  
Increases pulmonary vascular resistance  
Inhibits methionine synthetase  
Nondistensible gas spaces (middle ear, cerebral ventricles and supraentorial subdural space) will increase in pressure.  
Can cause rapid expansion of pneumothorax, and slow expansion in bowel obstruction.  
**Bowel Cases**  
Keep below 50% if used for a short bowel case. Bowel gas volume can double with nitrous in a prolonged case.  
Second Gas Effect-The uptake (onset) and the offset of a second gas is faster when simultaneously using Nitrous.  
**Adverse Effect:**  
**Diffusion Hypoxia**  
As nitrous oxide diffuses out of the lungs, it reduces the amount of oxygen within the airways, and there is a relative diffusion hypoxia. Because of this, 100% O2 is recommended post extubation.
