### Airway/Pulmonary with Burn Patients

Immediateand continued airway assessment is a priority.  
Inhalation injury is the #1 cause of death in burn patients  
  
Both, the burn and the inflammatory response can affect the pulmonary system. The inflammatory response can be delayed up to several hours post-exposure.  
  
Edema, secretions, obstruction are common complications.

Smoke, flame, and /or damaging gases result in thermal injury and / or chemical irritation of the airways and lungs.

**Inhalation Injury Facts**  
Inhalation injury is the most frequent cause of death in burn patients in the United States  
Occurs in 10% to 25% of burn-injured patients  
Increases mortality rate by up to 25%  
Symptoms may be delayed up to several hours post exposure

**Possible causes of post burn impaired gas exchange:**  
Edema  
Bronchial casts  
Sloughing of tissues  
Decreased clearance related to impaired mucociliary transport  
Decreased surfactant (tendency for alveolar collapse)

Circumferential burns of the chest can restrict the chest for adequate expansion.

Upper airways are much more affected. Typically, the lower airways are not affected, unless super-heated gases, such as steam, or small particulate matter are involved.

**Lung injury sequelae:**  
Laryngospasm  
Bronchospasm  
Bronchitis  
Shunt  
Decreased pulmonary compliance  
ARDS - from inflammatory response, capillary leak and fluid resuscitation

Post inhalation injury may develop respiratory distress, bronchitis, and reactive airways, which may require an aerosol treatment or MDI preoperatively.

**Ventilation:**  
Early, planned, and controlled intubation is preferred over later emergent based upon sign and symptoms of respiratory compromise.  
Usually high minute ventilation and PEEP are required.

**Early Phase (direct):**  
Upper airway obstruction  
Effects of smoke inhalation; thermal injury and chemical irritation  
Asphyxia

**Indirect:**  
Effects of inflammatory mediators; increased vascular permeability  
Pulmonary edema increased from fluid resuscitation

**Late Direct:** Chest wall restriction

**Late Indirect:  
**Complications of ventilation  
Oxygen toxicity  
Barotrauma  
Infections

Laryngeal damage  
Tracheal stenosis

All burn patents should receive 100% oxygen via a non-rebreathing mask on initial admission. An **immediate assessment** must be made to see it the airway was compromised.  
  
On admission, the initial compromise of the airway is almost always due to a low Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) and not the burn; loss of consciousness preventing the patient from protecting the airway.

**Early intubation is common since the results of an inhalation injury may be delayed with a sudden onset.** There is a potential for a sudden onset of airway edema that can result in acute obstruction and death.

**When to consider early intubation:**  
**(Signs and symptoms associated with airway edema from inhalation injury)**  
Stridor  
Hypoxemia or hypercapnia  
GCS of < 8  
Deep facial burns  
Full-thickness neck burns  
Oropharyngeal edema (including swollen tongue)  
History of entrapment in a closed space  
Facial burns  
Symptoms of respiratory distress  
Presence of carbonaceous sputum  
Increased WOB post fluid resuscitation  
Increased WOB

**Early intubation / fiber optic:**  
Early intubation is usually not difficult due to the lack of airway swelling. Fiber optic intubation via bronchoscopy is common to further assess distal airway damage. An ETT of 8.0 mm or above is used for the bronchoscopy. A Glide Scope is also common to use.

**The key features of airway assessment in major burns are:  
**Preexisting airway abnormality  
Current airway injury (inhalation injury)  
Signs of airway edema and obstruction

**Airway edema and pediatrics:  
**We all remember that children have smaller and narrower airways as compared to adults. The flow of air is laminar and proportional to the fourth power of the radius. Even small changes in trachea diameter from edema can have significant effects on air flow in children. Airway obstruction develops rapidly in smaller children.  
Example – a neonate 4mm airway, 1cm of _circumferential_ edema reduces the diameter by 50% resulting in a 16-fold airway resistance increase

**Difficult airway:**  
You can safely assume that any patient with burns of the face, neck, and upper chest or signs of inhalation injury has a difficult airway; awake fiberoptic intubation, Glide scope may be necessary.  
  
**Respiratory symptoms with inhalation injury depend on:**  
Chemical composition  
Particulate size of inhaled smoke  
Duration of exposure  
Patient's tidal volume during inhalation  
  
  
**3 Types of injuries with smoke inhalation**  
**1\. Thermal injury  
**Mostly restricted to the upper airway**\-** primarily restricted to airway structures above the vocal cords, unless steam is inhaled.  
  
Heat destroys the epithelial layer, denatures proteins, and activates the complement cascade. This results in the release histamine and nitric oxide and the formation of xanthine oxidase, which leads to increased endothelium permeability that results in airway edema.  
  
Airway symptoms such as dyspnea and stridor may be delayed until the edema significantly decreases airway diameter. Aggressive intravenous hydration necessary to treat burn shock can contribute significantly to airway edema formation and may increase the progression of airway obstruction.  
  
  

**2\. Chemical irritation of the respiratory tract**  
**Chemicals inhaled that damage the tracheal bronchial tree, alveoli, and lung parenchyma (products of combustion):**  
Aldehydes and oxides of sulfur and nitrogen  
Hydrochloric acid  
Carbon monoxide  
  
**Chemical destruction of bronchial epithelium results in:  
**Mucosal/interstitial edema and sloughing  
Impaired mucociliary clearance  
Inactivation of surfactant  
Formation of endobronchial casts  
  
The first two above may also lead to partial or complete airway obstruction. Pulmonary compliance may be decreased up to 50% within the first 24 hours after injury causing acute micro-atelectasis and ventilation perfusion mismatch.

**3\. Systemic toxicity**  
Absorption of toxic gases (carbon monoxide)  
Carbon monoxide poisoning should be suspected in patients with inhalation injuries and is diagnosed by elevated carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) level.  
  
Carbon monoxide poisoning symptoms vary and correlate with COHb level.  
COHb levels 15-60 = headache à N/V, impaired vision à agitation, coma, shock, death.  
  
A COHb level greater than 30% requires 100% inspired oxygen to quickly reduce the COHb half-life. Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin, myoglobin, and cytochromes with an affinity 200 times stronger than that of oxygen, and elimination of COHb is dependent on alveolar oxygen pressure rather than alveolar ventilation.  
  
The COHb half-life can be reduced from 4 hours with room air to 60 to 90 minutes with the administration of 100% inspired oxygen. Normal oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry does NOT exclude CO toxicity.

**Fiberoptic bronchoscopy** is the gold standard for diagnosis and evaluation of inhalation injury. Usually performed with early an early intubation.**  
  
Chest X-ray** may show signs of diffuse atelectasis, pulmonary edema, or bronchopneumonia. However, a CXR may underestimate airway injury when signs of damage are delayed or primarily confined to the conducting airways.
