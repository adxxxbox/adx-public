Oculocardiac Reflex (OCR)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Oculocardiac Reflex (OCR)

Some refer to this reflex as the “5 and dime” after the cranial nerves involved.**Afferent nerve:** Trigeminal (cranial nerve #5)  
**Efferent nerve:**  Vagus (cranial nerve # 10)**OCR** results with a decrease in HR associated with traction applied to extraocular muscles and/or compression of the eyeball.  
Most commonly encountered in pediatric patients undergoing strabismus surgery  
Can be evoked at all ages.  
**Incidence during ophthalmic surgery:** 30-90%

| Stimuli | Pressure applied to the globe of the eye or traction on the surrounding structures.  
Ocular trauma  
Severe pain  
Orbital compression due to hematoma or edema.  
Orbital injections (retrobulbar block)  
Note: Globe does NOT need to be present for the reflex.  
Manipulation of tissue in orbital apex after enucleation.  
Tense orbital hematoma following an enucleation procedure.  
During pan facial trauma surgeries due to stimulation of any of the three branches of trigeminal nerve. |
| Receptor | Stretch receptors in the extraocular muscles (esp. medial rectus)  
When activated, they send afferent signals through short and long ciliary nerves. |
| Afferent nerves | Trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve #5)  
Afferents synapse with visceral motor nucleus located in the reticular formation.  
Ciliary nerves merge with ophthalmic division of trigeminal nerve at ciliary ganglion. |
| Center | Cardiovascular center of the medulla  
Ciliary ganglion and Gasserian ganglion |
| Efferent nerves | Vagus nerve (cranial nerve X)  
Efferent travel to the heart and decrease output from the SA node,  
↑ Parasympathetic-vagus → ↑ Ach release → Heart SA node → Bradycardia |
| Response | Usually Bradycardia and hypotension. Possible bigeminy, ectopic beats, AV block, and asystole. |

Intraoperative treatment of OCR  
**Notify the surgeon to stop or remove orbital stimulation.  
If arrythmia/bradycardia does not resolve consider atropine 20 mcg/kg IV or 0.2 mg of glycopyrrolate.  
  
**Postoperative Management  
****Warning:** OCR may occur as much as 1.5 hours after a retrobulbar hemorrhage.Retrobulbar hemorrhage can result in delayed OCR as persistent bleeding gradually increases periocular pressure.Monitor carefully in the PACU if suspected retrobulbar hemorrhage.
