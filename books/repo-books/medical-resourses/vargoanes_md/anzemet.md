# Anzemet

**Anzemet (Dolasetron)**  
**Class:** anti-nauseant and antiemetic agent.  
Highly specific and selective serotonin subtype 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist.  
Not nearly as popular as Zofran.  
More popular for to preventing nausea before chemotherapy.  
**Doses:**  
12.5 mg IV 15 minutes before the cessation of anesthesia.  
(prevention) or as soon as nausea or vomiting presents (treatment).  
**Peds:** 2 to 16 years of age is 0.35 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 12.5 mg.  
**Like Zofran-** The FDA also previously noted cardiovascular safety concerns which suggested Anzemet could cause QT prolongation.  
**RECOMMENDATION:**  
Avoid ANZEMET in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia.  
Serotonin receptors of the 5-HT3 type are located peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema.  
**MOA:**  
During chemotherapy-induced vomiting, mucosal enterochromaffin cells release serotonin, which stimulates 5-HT3 receptors. This evokes vagal afferent discharge and may induce vomiting.  
Studies demonstrate that, in binding to 5-HT3 receptors, Anzemet blocks serotonin stimulation and subsequent vomiting after emetogenic stimuli such as cisplatin.
