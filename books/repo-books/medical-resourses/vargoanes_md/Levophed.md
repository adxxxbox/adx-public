### Norepinephrine (Levophed)

**Generic Name:** Norepinephrine bitartrate**Brand Name:** Levophed**Drug Class:** Alpha/Beta-Adrenergic Agonist  
**  
Sometimes referred to as:**  
l-arterenol  
Levarterenol  
l-norepinephrine  
Norepinephrine = NE  
Intraoperative hypotension = IOH  
  
**Concentrations for continuous infusion:  
**4 mg of NE in a 250 mL bag of NS or D5W = 16 mcg/mL  
8 mg of NE in a 500 mL bag of NS or D5W = 16 mcg/ mL  
8 mg of NE in a 250 mL bag of NS or D5W = 32 mcg/mL  
  
**Continuous infusion ranges:  
**2-35 mcg/min or  
0.01-0.3 mcg/kg/min  
**  
Maximum doses for refractory shock:  
**80 to 250 mcg/minute or  
2 to 3.3 mcg/kg/minute  
**  
Single diluted bolus for IOH:  
**2-4 mcg (diluted to 4 mcg/mL)  
  
**Low dose of NE (< 4 mcg/min) continuous infusion:**  
Beta actions are predominant  
↑ Venous relaxation  
↑ Cardiac contractility (positive inotrope)  
Little to no chronotropic effect  
  
**Larger dose of NE (> 5 mcg/min) continuous infusion:**  
↑ Arterial and venous vasoconstriction  
↑ Cardiac contractility (positive inotrope)  
↓ HR (baroreceptor triggered)  
  
**Indications:  
**\- First-line vasopressor for patients in septic, cardiogenic, and hypovolemic shock.  
\- For the treatment of a low SVR after cardiopulmonary bypass.  
  
**Other indications of IOH:  
**\- Hypotension with single diluted boluses\- Hypotensive patients with pulmonary hypertension (esp. with compromised cardiac function)  
  
**NE for IOH patients with pulmonary hypertension (PHT):**  
\- NE will decrease the pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) /systolic BP (SBP) ratio.  
\- For intraoperative hypotension, NE is preferred over phenylephrine for patients with PHT because it decreases the PAP/SBP ratio and maintains the CI.  
\- For PHT patients with compromised cardiac function, NE is preferred over phenylephrine and vasopressin because NE increases cardiac contractility.  
**  
Mechanism of action:**  
\- Peripheral vasoconstrictor by acting on alpha-adrenergic receptors.  
\- Inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries via beta-1 activation.  
  
**Involved receptors:**  
Alpha-1 agonist: +++  
βeta-1 agonist: ++  
Beta-2 agonist: + (weak)  
  
**NE background facts:  
**\- A hydroxylated derivative of dopamine.  
\- A natural precursor of epinephrine that is secreted by the adrenal medulla.  
\- A widespread central and autonomic neurotransmitter.  
\- The main transmitter of the sympathetic nervous system.  
\- Also found in plants and is used pharmacologically as a sympathomimetic.  
**Physiologic effects:  
↑** Coronary artery dilation (Beta -1 activation)  
↑ Cardiac contractility (positive inotrope)  
↑ Stroke volume  
↑ Cardiac output  
↑ or maintains heart rate  
↓ HR (baroreceptor triggered) at higher doses (higher doses)  
↑ Arterial and venous vasoconstriction (higher doses)  
↑ Arterial pressure (SVR) and afterload (higher doses)  
↑ Systemic filling pressure (higher doses)  
↑ Venous return and cardiac preload (higher doses)  
↑ Oxygen delivery (DO 2 )  
Maintains cardiac index (CI)  
↓ Tissue splenic perfusion (higher doses)  
  
**Precautions and concerns:  
Administering NE to a hypovolemic patient may result in organ ischemia.  
**\- Address hypovolemia prior to administering NE  
  
**Administration of NE to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in the following:**  
\- Severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction  
\- Decreased renal perfusion  
\- Reduced urine output  
\- Tissue hypoxia  
\- Lactic acidosis  
\- Reduced systemic blood flow despite “normal” blood pressure.  
  
**Central venous catheter (CVC) vs peripheral IV:  
**\- NE has historically been administered through a central venous catheter (CVC) for fear of peripheral extravasation and direct tissue injury from using a peripheral IV.  
\- NE can be safely administered as a peripheral infusion in the OR if certain conditions are met.  
\- CVC placement should not be a prerequisite for administration.  
\- Single diluted doses as needed for IOH are becoming more popular.  
  
**Suggested conditions when infusing NE peripherally:  
**\- IV catheter should be 20-18 gauge in size.\- IV site should be proximal to or at the antecubital fossa.  
\- Duration should not exceed 6-12 hours but based on the clinician’s judgment.  
\- IV site should be closely monitored for extravasation.  
\- Phentolamine or nitroglycerin paste is available if extravasation occurs.  
\- Prefer 16 mcg/mL over 32 mcg/mL for continuous infusion.  
  
**Emergency treatment of extravasation from NE _:_**5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% NaCl injection in adults.  
**Hypotension after abrupt discontinuation:  
**\- Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension.  
\- When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the NE infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids.  
  
**Cardiac Arrhythmias:  
**\- NE elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly with the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia.  
**  
Allergic reactions associated with sulfite:  
**\- NE contains sodium metabisulfite.  
\- Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people.  
**  
Possible drug interactions:  
MAO-Inhibiting Drugs:  
**\- Co-administration of NE with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or other drugs with MAO-inhibiting properties (e.g., linezolid) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension.  
**  
Tricyclic Antidepressants:**  
\- Co-administration of NE with tricyclic antidepressants (including amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, and imipramine) can cause severe, prolonged hypertension.  
  
**Antidiabetics:  
**\- NE can decrease insulin sensitivity and raise blood glucose.  
\- Monitor glucose and consider a dosage adjustment of antidiabetic drugs.  
**  
Halogenated anesthetics:  
**NE with halogenated anesthetics (e.g., cyclopropane, desflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane) may lead to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.  
**  
Breastfeeding:**  
There are no data on the presence of NE in breast milk.  
  
**Elimination:**  
**Mean half-life:** 2.4 min  
**The average metabolic clearance:** 3.1 L/min  
**Metabolism:** A combination of reactions involving the enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO in the liver and other tissues.  
  
**Metabolites:** (inactive)  
Normetanephrine  
3- methoxyl-4-hydroxy mandelic acid (vanillylmandelic acid, VMA)  
3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol  
3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid  
3,4- dihydroxyphenylglycol  
**Excretion:** urine\- Noradrenaline metabolites are excreted in the urine primarily as sulfate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, as glucuronide conjugates.  
\- Only small quantities of norepinephrine are excreted unchanged.  
  
**Possible side effects or complications:**  
Dizziness  
Weakness  
Headache  
Dysrhythmia  
Breathing difficulty  
Redness and swelling at the injection site  
Sudden numbness/weakness/cold feeling  
Decreased urine output  
Severe hypertension  
Seizure  
Cardiac Arrhythmias  
Tissue ischemia  
Tissue necrosis from extravasation
