Prekallikrein Deficiency    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Prekallikrein Deficiency  

**Other names:**  
Congenital prekallikrein deficiency  
Fletcher factor deficiency  
Fletcher trait  
PKK deficiency

**Quick Note:** Only around 80 cases have been reported.  
Most of the patients are asymptomatic; it is likely that a large number of individuals go unrecognized and unreported.  
  
A rare autosomal recessive disorder.  
Seven types of mutations in prekallikrein deficient families have been identified.  
  
PK was initially described by Hathaway et. al. in 1965 after encountering a Kentucky family who displayed abnormal aPTT (with normal PTT) results, but showed no bleeding symptoms.  
The family appeared to have a hereditary deficiency in an unknown coagulation factor, named “Fletcher factor” after the family. In 1973 Kirk Wuepper determined that Fletcher factor and prekallikrein were the same.  
  
**Acquired Prekallikrein Deficiency**  
Usually mild-to-moderate decreases in prekallikrein may be found in liver disease or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Rarely, a prekallikrein inhibitor (antibody) has been reported.  
  
Fletcher factor-deficient plasma is deficient in prekallikrein and therefore generates no bradykinin upon activation with kaolin with a PTT test resulting in a pronged PTT.  
  
Prekallikrein deficiency is rare and does not cause bleeding, despite prolongation of the aPTT. The lack of bleeding is presumably because the extrinsic pathway of coagulation, via factor VII and tissue factor, remains intact, and factor XI can be activated by thrombin generated from the extrinsic pathway.  
Thus, factor XI can be activated without the need for prekallikrein, HMWK, or factor XII. This is consistent with the observation that deficiencies of the latter three factors are not associated with bleeding.  
  
_Deficiencies in PK can also be acquired due to some disease states, such as angioedema, infection, DIC, and sickle-cell disease._
