Latissimus Dorsi Flap    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Latissimus Dorsi Flap

(Breast reconstruction using latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flaps)  
  
This reconstruction usually follows mastectomy.  
  
**Indication:** To create a new breast mound after a mastectomy.  
  
**Procedure:** Transfer of the back tissues (latissimus muscle, fat, blood vessels and small amount of back skin) to the mastectomy site. Placement of a tissue expander under the transferred tissue.  
  
**Blood supply of the flap:** thoracodorsal artery. This artery and vein are left attached to their original blood supply.  
  
**Anesthetic:** General Endotracheal  
  
**Position:** Following the supine mastectomy, the patient is turned lateral or prone (depending on the plastic surgeon’s preference).  
After the tissue (or "flap") is tunneled to the front of the chest to create the new breast, the patient is turned supine a second time to complete the shaping of the new breast.  
  
**Duration:** 2-5 hours (not including the mastectomy).  
**EBL:** 150-400ml  
**Warming Blanket:** Required; procedure is lengthy and the torso is exposed so lower body warmer is used.  
  
**More Notes  
**It is the largest flap that can be harvested on a single pedicle.  
The Latissimus Dorsi muscle is thin (less than 1 centimeter thick), allowing it to be draped over irregular surfaces with ease. Occasionally, for a thin patient with a small breast volume, an implant may not be needed.  
  
It is an effective alternative for women who may not be suitable candidates for tissue expansion or TRAM flap reconstruction. Also, because a latissimus dorsi flap doesn’t involve abdominal surgery like the TRAM, deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (DIEP), and superficial inferior epigastric artery (SIEA) flaps, the surgery is less involved and the recovery time is usually shorter.  
  
**Advantage:**  
This flap uses soft tissue that creates a more natural looking breast shape as compared to an implant alone. The risk of failure for the latissimus dorsi is less than 1%.  
The transplanted skin will be a close color match for their breast skin. The reconstructed breast will feel warm and somewhat flexible. It should last a lifetime.  
  
**Disadvantages:**  
Still usually requires an implant. The tissue from the patient’s back is not sufficient to recreate the breast mound.  
  
Most patients require a 1-night stay in the hospital and 2-3 weeks rest at home prior to returning to work. Patients with lymphedema may experience transient worsening in arm swelling. Another disadvantage is the longer healing time from the two surgical sites and two scars. Many women may experience weakness in the arm and back muscles and need physical therapy post-operatively.  
  
**Patients that are not candidates for this procedure:**  
If the patient has DM, PVD or connective tissue disorders.  
Overweight or obese  
Very large breasts
