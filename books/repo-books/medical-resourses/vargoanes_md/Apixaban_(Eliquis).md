Apixaban (Eliquis)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Apixaban (Eliquis)

**Class:** Factor Xa inhibitor (reversible and direct acting)  
Selective Orally administered.  
  
**Review:** Inhibiting thrombin prevents the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and subsequent cross linking of fibrin monomers, platelet activation and amplification of coagulation.  
  
**Note:** Generic names for these agents include "Xa-ban" (eg, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban).  
  
**Apixaban vs Warfarin and Aspirin**  
As effective as warfarin and more effective than aspirin in preventing stroke and systemic embolization in patients with atrial fibrillation.  
  
Apixaban had a significantly lower rate of bleeding for intracranial hemorrhage and a lower rate of major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding, in comparison with warfarin.  
  
Not approved in the US until 2012.  
  
**Indications:**  
Stroke prophylaxis with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.  
Postoperative Prophylaxis of DVT/PE for hip and knee surgery  
DVT or PE Treatment  
Prevention and treatment for VTE  
  
Apixaban had a significantly lower rate of bleeding for intracranial hemorrhage and a lower rate of major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding, compared to warfarin.  
Mechanism of Action  
Apixaban is a selective inhibitor of Factor Xa.  
It does not require antithrombin III for antithrombotic activity (as a mediator).  
Apixaban inhibits free and clot-bound FXa, and prothrombinase activity.  
Apixaban has no direct effect on platelet aggregation, but indirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. By inhibiting FXa, apixaban decreases thrombin generation and thrombus development.  
  
**Lab Monitoring:** Apixaban and other Factor Xa inhibitors are considered reliable and do not need routine monitoring, unlike warfarin and heparin.  
There are specific lab tests for each Factor Xa inhibitor.  
  
**Optional Lab Monitoring**  
**Anti-Xa assay:** is most reliable  
**Normal antifactor Xa assay:** indicates no anticoagulation effect.  
**Elevated PT:** Apixaban is present, but no linear correlation  
**Normal PT:** Minimal drug effect  
**Elevated aPTT and INR:** Apixaban is present, but no linear correlation  
  
Lab results may vary by reagent and instrumentation

**Dosing:** Available in 2.5 and 5 mg tablets under the commercial name Eliquis.  
Usual dose is 2.5 or 5 mg twice daily.  
  
**Switching from warfarin to apixaban**  
When switching anticoagulation from warfarin to apixaban, it is important to avoid using both drugs at therapeutic doses simultaneously; it is recommended that the INR be monitored daily after the cessation of warfarin, and that apixaban not started until the INR is <2.0, typically approximately three days after cessation of therapeutic warfarin.  
  
**Possible side effects:** Bleeding, headache, dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal upset, nausea, arthralgias and rash.  
  
**Bleeding and Factor Xa inhibitors  
**Annually, 1% to 4% of patients treated with factor Xa inhibitors experience major bleeding, and an additional 1% may require emergency surgery. In 2015, in the U.S, more than 80,000 patients treated with oral factor Xa inhibitors were admitted to hospitals because of bleeding.  
**  
Metabolism and Possible Drug Interactions**  
Metabolized in the liver predominantly via the cytochrome P450 system, CYP 3A4, and P-glycoprotein; potent inhibitors of CYP 3A4 (such as itraconazole, ritonavir and clarithromycin) can cause elevated levels of Apixaban, while inducers of CYP 3A4 (such as rifampin or phenytoin) can lead to reduced and ineffective levels of the anticoagulant.  
  
**Hepatic:** Liver injury associated with apixaban is rare.  
  
**Peak Activity:** Rapidly absorbed; peak onset of activity occurs at 3 to 4 hours.  
**Elimination:** 25% renal and 75% hepatic/biliary with intestinal excretion–both urine and feces.  
**T1/2:** 8 -15 hours  
**Elimination:** only 25% is renal and remaining 75% fecal.  
**Renal:** Apixaban is well tolerated in patients with renal deficiency.  
**Total Clearance:** 3.3 L/hour; an apparent half-life of approximately 12 hours following oral administration.  
  
**Specific Antidote:** Andexxa ( Andexanet Alpha)  
  
**Apixaban (Eliquis) and Neuraxial and Deep Regional Block**

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 72 hours | Avoid | Avoid with

**Restart medication after procedure:** ASRA recommends 6 hours  
**Remove catheter after administration:** ASRA recommends 3 days
