### Liver Transplantation

This is a busy case. We usually use 2 CRNAs because of all the transfusions to administer. You will become a master at transfusing blood products after one of these cases.

**Pre-op**: CBC, BMP, PT/PTT/INR, Liver enzymes, CXR, EKG, results of cardiac screening and epidural \[if not contraindicated by Coag results\], lung status, **TEE** for Porto-Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH).  

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT/RSI.  
**Relaxant:** Anectine if the K+ is WNL. Nimbex or Atracurium is your 1st choice for non-depolarizers. Because of the organ-independent elimination and diminished histamine release, Cisatracurium and Atracurium are preferred. Rocuronium and Norcuron are still ok in most instances if you do not have the refrigerated NDM relaxants readily available.  
**A-Line:** Yes  
**IV Access:** Large bore IVs, Central Line, PA and CVP monitoring.  
Some institutions insert two 9 French introducers centrally.  
**Duration:** 4-8 hours, these cases used to be 12 hours long.  
**TEE:** Some institutions use **TEE**s instead of PA monitoring, or both.  
**Inhalation Agent:** Isoflurane.Fluid warmer and warming blanket: Yes. Also, the perfusionist uses a heated venovenous bypass system during the anhepatic phase. This permits core temperature control.  
**Position:** Supine, right arm tucked and left arm and groin area out for access to the axillary and femoral veins for veno-veno bypass. No veno-veno bypass for Pediatric liver transplants.  
**Transfusions:****Units of RBCs given**: 20-100 units. The average seems to be around 30-40 units.  
**FFP given:** usually 20-25 bags given.  
**Platelets:** usually 10-15 bags.**CRNAs:** 2 are really needed here: 1 to chart and 1 to transfuse.  
**Thromboelastogram or TEG:** done Q1 hour to decide which products to transfuse.  
**Blood Transfuser:** Yes.Did you know the first blood transfuser was invented at University of Pittsburgh for liver transplants?  
  
**Prehapatic Stage:**Starts with a surgical incision and ends with cross- clamping of the portal vein, the suprahepatic inferior vena cava, the infrahepatic inferior vena cava, and the hepatic artery. Hemodynamic instability may be seen as a result of drainage of liters of ascitic fluid, transection of large varices and surgical manipulation of the liver, temporarily obstructing venous return. However, in this period of liver transplantation, the primary issue is surgical bleeding. In the presence of preexisting coagulopathy, FFP is indicated soon after incision.

Hyponatremia should not be corrected rapidly. Administering CaCl prevents citrate intoxication and ionized hypocalcemia resulting from the infusion of citrate-rich blood products in the absence of hepatic function.

Ionized HYPOmagnesemia also results from citrate infusion, but values of ionized magnesium gradually return to normal after liver reperfusion.

Aggressive treatment of hypokalemia is best avoided, particularly in preparation for reperfusion and the associated increase in serum potassium.

**Prehapatic Stage**:  
\[These are not in order of performance but just a general list…\]  
TEE  
Intravenous antibiotics  
Incision  
Invasive monitoring (A-line, CVP and PA).  
Lower CVP (5 cm H2O) to decrease bleeding.  
Restriction of IV fluids.  
Give albumin in severe hypoalbuminemia- 25%.  
Vasopressin (Norepinephrine) to keep mean blood pressure MAP >60 mmHg.  
Epinephrine or dopamine to preserve CO.  
(CO)>5L/min.  
Draw Labs  
Maintain Hb >7 g/dl.  
Platelets >40k.  
TEG >45mm.  
Fibrinogen >100mg/dl.  
Prior to clamping give Mannitol 0.5 g/kg  
Just before clamping give Heparin 3-5000 Units IV  
Increase CVP to 10 cm H2O  
Periods of hypotension during the surgery may require temporary discontinuation of the volatile agent.  
Versed may be given at these times.  

**Anhepatic Stage:**The anhepatic stage begins with the occlusion of vascular inflow to the liver and ends with graft reperfusion. Cross-clamping of the suprahepatic and infrahepatic vena cava (IVC) decreases venous return by as much as 50%. Venovenous bypass (VVB), which diverts inferior vena cava and portal venous flow to the axillary vein, attenuates the decrease in preload, improves renal perfusion pressure, lessens splanchnic congestion, and delays the development of metabolic acidosis.  
Despite the absence of hepatic clotting factor production during the anhepatic stage, blood loss is usually limited by vascular clamping of the inflow vessels to the liver.

**Goals**:  
Maintain Hgb >7 g/dl.  
Maintain IV fluids to keep CVP around 5 cmH20.  
Vasopressin/Norepinephrine Drips to preserve BP>60 mmHg and CO>5 L/min.  
Correct base deficit.  
Normocalcemia  
  
**Neohepatic phase:**  
This phase is associated with elevations of potassium and hydrogen ion concentrations, an increase in preload and a decrease in SVR with a decrease in blood pressure. The resulting increase in distal venous pressure may increase bleeding, impair renal perfusion and often promotes edema and ischemia of intestines.  
When the venous anastomosis to the graft is completed, the liver is flushed with blood and the clamp on the IVC is released. This reperfusion of the graft is associated with elevations of K+ and H+, increase in preload and decrease in SVR with a decrease in blood pressure (Postperfusion Syndrome).

Postperfusion Syndrome is when the recipient experiences a 30% or more decrease in mean systemic blood pressure for more than 1 minute during the first 5 minutes following reperfusion of the new liver and by initial reperfusion of the hepatic artery. Approximately one in three patients undergoing liver transplantation has profound hypotension after reperfusion.

Give IV Vasopressin 1-5 U bolus to keep BP>60 mmHg; Euvolemia (CVP 5-10 cm H2O) Dopamine/Epinephrine to preserve C.O>5L/min.  
Norepinephrine/Vasopressin to preserve BP>60 mmHg.  
TEE if necessary.  
More Labs.  
Maintain Hgb>7 g/dl.  
Platelets>40,000.  
Fibrinogen>100 mg/dl.  
Thromboelastograms or TEGs  
Protamine 30 mg if surgeon requests it.  
Maintain MA>45 mm with platelet infusion.
