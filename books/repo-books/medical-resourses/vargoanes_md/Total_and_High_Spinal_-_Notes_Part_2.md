### Total & High Spinal Notes Pt 2

(Just a different approach from part 1)

**Factors to Remember:** A sympathectomy will be 2-6 dermatomes higher than the sensory block.  
  
Sympathetic nerve fibers are extremely sensitive to the effects of local anesthetics and the subsequent vasodilation.  
  
A local anesthetic is approximately 10 times more potent in the subarachnoid space versus the epidural space.  
  
The volume of an epidural dose is 6 times greater than that of a spinal dose. This is why an epidural test dose is so important. An epidural dose inadvertently administered intrathecally can be devastating.  
A high or total spinal onset usually occurs within minutes. However, delay up to 30 minutes has been reported.  
  
Incidence rate for some sort of a high spinal block: around <1%. Literature varies.  
  
Now let’s look at the image below to give you a better picture.As a local anesthetic moves up (cephalad) the spinal cord (mixed in the CSF), it will affect the nerve roots that are responsible for the listed functions, illustrated below.  
Vaginal delivery - your dermatome goal is T10  
C-section - your dermatome goal is T-4

**_Warning_** _: With a high or total spinal, bradycardia, profound hypotension and apnea may occur quickly and fairly close together or slower in sequence as listed below. Sometimes cardiac arrest and seizure may closely follow. Immediate action is always required.  
  
_**First Set of Symptoms for a Total or High Spinal“  
  
I can’t breathe” is a common first statement made by the patient!  
  
The first symptom is Hypotension and possibly nausea and vomiting (T1-L2)**  
This can be overlooked because hypotension is common in neuraxial anesthesia with pregnant women in OB. Remember, you have sympathetic fibers exiting the spinal cord from T1-L2. Some of the fibers will be blocked from a normally distributed spinal resulting in some hypotension.  
The hypotension with a high spinal will more profound since the local anesthetic could be showering all the way up to T1 (rather than T4 dermatome needed for a C-section).  
The more sympathetic fibers blocked, the more hypotension.  
Nausea and high sensory level block (>T1) may be early indicators.  
  
**Shoulders, hands and fingers (T1-C7)  
**If the block spreads higher, to T1 up to C7, sensory and motor function to the upper extremities and hands can become impaired. The patient may complain of tingling or numbness or weakness in the shoulders, hands or fingers. This should be a red flag and be prepared to have your potent pressors in case it is not a false alarm. Be aware that bradycardia MAY follow.  
During a C-section, it is common for a patient to complain of hand tingling on the side of the blood pressure cuff. This is common for any awake patient getting a blood pressure every minute.  
  
**Hand, Wrist and Elbow Movement (C6-8)  
**Usually occurs with the shoulder and hand movement. This should still be a red flag and be prepared to have your potent pressors in case it is not a false alarm.  
  
**Bradycardia** (T1-T4 are the cardiac accelerator fibers) _Big Red Flag  
_Bradycardia may be associated with profound hypotension and a desaturation.  
  
**Treatment  
Atropine** is your first choice. Don’t waste your time with robinul.  
1-10 mcg of **epinephrine** (if associated with hypotension) or  
1-2 units of **vasopressin** \- whichever you can administer quicker.  
A large dose of your remaining ephedrine may help while you are drawing up epinephrine or vasopressin. Be prepared.  
**Note:** _It is common for the patient to complain of SOB during a C-section while having normal vital signs_ . It is UNLIKELY for a patient to experience SOB with a TRUE high spinal without FIRST having cardiovascular and upper extremity symptoms.  
  
The accessory muscles of respiration (sternocleidomastoid, scalene, and abdominal muscles) are affected or blocked. This results in SOB and smaller tidal volumes. The patient may complain of difficulty breathing.  
  
**Diaphragmatic Breathing Stops - may not be able to talk, shoulder weakness (C3-C5)  
**Shoulder weakness is a warning sign of impending diaphragmatic compromise.  
“I can’t breathe” is commonly stated at this point.  
**“C3, 4 and 5 keeps the diaphragm alive.”** The bradycardia may be accompanied with shortness of breath since the dermatomes overlap. At this point the patient may no longer talk, the diaphragm becomes paralyzed and breathing stops.  
Profound hypotension may still be present.  
  
**Immediately ask the family to leave with a quick calm explanation.**It is important to reassure the partner, but you need to ask him/her to leave - try to give a brief explanation of the situation if time permits. Get a member of staff member to escort him/her.**Treatment:  
Call for help** and call for the crash cart if you have not already.  
**Administer versed** for amnesia and seizure prevention (you may not have time).  
**Fluids wide open** unless contraindicated **Administer the vasopressors for hypotension:  
**As mentioned above, repeat doses of epinephrine or vasopressin. Consider a drip and titrate to effect if needed.  
  
**Induce and intubate.  
****.RSI because they are an aspiration risk.  
**If there is a failed intubation remember that spontaneous ventilation will not return because the patient is paralyzed.  
Proceed to a difficult intubation protocol if needed. Assume that the mother is aware until drugs have been administered. Talk to her calmly and explain what you are doing even if she appears unconscious.  
  
Your goal is stabilize the patient with all means of resuscitation to enhance a successful stat  
C-section. The may need to be intubated and ventilated until the spinal block wears off in a few hours.  
  
**Intracranial spread:** If the local anesthetic reaches the brain, unconsciousness is assured.Your goal is stabilize the patient with all means of resuscitation to enhance a successful stat  
C-section. The may need to be intubated and ventilated until the spinal block wears off in a few hours.  
  
**More Notes  
Position with a high spinal** (0.75% Bupivacaine is hyperbaric)  
With hypotension, never put the patient in Trendelenburg like we normally do for hypotension in the operating room etc. This will spread the block higher. Sit the patient’s head up.Block height can only be manipulated with positioning for 20-30 mins when using hyperbaric solutions.  
  
**For continuous Epidural Infusions  
**Use low concentrations of local anesthetic agent for labor analgesia.  
Assess block prior to giving a top up dose.  
Always aspirate to check that the catheter is not in the CSF (or a vein) before and after EVERY bolus.  
  
Give a test dose – ensure the volume you use is adequate to manifest a spinal block (NOT high spinal) if the catheter is intrathecal. For epidural dosing, consider giving large volumes of local anesthetic in smaller divided doses.  
  
**Maternal Hypotension**  
A drop in maternal blood pressure of greater than 20% requires immediate action.  
Severe hypotension will compromise placental blood flow and if not treated will result in maternal cardiac arrest. Relieve aortocaval compression with manual uterine displacement or by left lateral tilt – this can be achieved using a 1 liter wedge or pillow under the right hand side of the patient or by tilting the operating table. In the operating room, a liter IV bag is very commonly used for the left tilt.  
  
**RSI and Intubation  
**You should always have equipment available for an emergency intubation.  
Make sure your assistant knows how to apply cricoid pressure.  
  
Be careful what you say: The patient is still fully aware until induction.  
  
Talk to her calmly and explain what you are doing even if she appears unconscious.  
  
**Failed Intubation  
**Just remember that spontaneous ventilation will not return. Proceed to a failed intubation drill protocol for a paralyzed patient. Use a Glidescope if necessary.  
  
**Ventilator until the block wears off  
**The patient must be ventilated, even by hand if necessary. The high block usually wears off in 1-2 hours. Sedation is also a good idea.  
  
**Remember the fetus**  
Stabilizing the mother is in the best interests of the baby, but once this is achieved consideration needs to be given to whether or not to deliver.  
**  
Is there fetal compromise?**  
If yes, an emergency caesarean section will be needed.  
  
**No fetal distress**  
If there is no fetal distress, be happy! A vaginal delivery may still be possible once the block has receded.
