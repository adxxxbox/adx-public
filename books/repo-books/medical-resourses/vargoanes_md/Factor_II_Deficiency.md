### Factor II Deficiency

Factor II (FII) deficiency, also called prothrombin deficiency, was first identified in 1947 by Dr. Armand Quick.  
Can be congenital or acquired later in life. Acquired is more common.  
  
**Etiology:** Inherited FII deficiency is caused by mutations in the _F2_ gene (11p11-q12) encoding prothrombin.  
  
**Homozygous:** Generally asymptomatic and have functional prothrombin levels of 2-25%.  
  
**Heterozygous:** Generally asymptomatic and have prothrombin levels of 50% or greater on both immunologic and functional assays.  
  
Levels of prothrombin deficiency can range from 2% to 50% of normal.  
Patients with levels near or at 50% of normal have little to no bleeding problems.  
  
**Incidence:** 1 per 2 million  
Autosomal recessive disorder, thus both parents must carry the defective gene to pass it on to their child.  
Affects both males and females  
  
_**Dysprothrombinemia:**_ abnormality in the structure/function of prothrombin.  
Only the functional assay for prothrombin returns significantly reduced values, whereas the immunologic assay reveals normal values.  
  
**Hypoprothrombinemia** **–** deficient in numbers.  
In true hypoprothrombinemia, immunologic assays correlate well with functional assays in that both reveal low prothrombin values.  
  
**Lab Diagnosis  
**Factor II assay - more specific  
aPTT-prolonged  
PT-prolonged  
  
**Possible causes for acquired factor II deficiency**  
Immunologic - produced antibodies directed against the protein.  
Severe liver disease.  
Vitamin K deficiency.  
Anticoagulants **–** warfarin.  
Long-term use of antibiotics.  
Bile obstruction.  
  
**Common symptoms -** (vary for everyone, the more deficient, the more severe).  
Nosebleeds (epistaxis).  
Easy bruising.  
Menorrhagia **–** may be controlled with hormonal contraceptives.  
Bleeding into joints (hemarthrosis).  
Muscle bleeds.  
Bleeding in the mouth, particularly after dental surgery or tooth extraction.  
  
**Other reported symptoms  
**GI bleeding.  
Bleeding from the umbilical cord stump at birth.  
Abnormal bleeding during or after injury, surgery, or childbirth.  
  
**Rare symptoms**  
CNS bleed - brain and spinal cord.  
Hematuria.  
  
**Treatment**  
Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs).  
Fresh frozen plasma (FFP).  
Vitamin K supplements - If a lack of vitamin K is causing the disorder, patients can take vitamin K per PO, SQ injections or IV.  
  
**FFP Dosing:** 15-20 mL/kg is needed to obtain a 20-30% increase in Factor II.  
  
PCCs differ in the amount of FII they contain depending on the manufacturer, which complicates treatment.  
_Warning: PCCs can increase the risk of thrombosis and, thus they are typically prescribed only for severe bleeding._
