### Mechanical Thrombectomy

**This is a urgent procedure and time is of the essence to save the vulnerable penumbra!**  
**Ischemic penumbra:** Tissue that is still salvageable and will infarct in a time dependent fashion unless reperfusion of that area reoccurs.  
  
_2 million more nerve cells are lost every minute in which reperfusion does not occur from  
large artery cerebral ischemia_  
  
In the first 3 hours after a large artery vascular occlusion, virtually every patient still harbors at least some salvageable penumbral tissue and may benefit from reperfusion intervention.  
  
These are **urgent** cases performed in a specialized vascular room at a certified stroke center.  
Mechanical thrombectomy is an urgent procedure to remove a debilitating causing thrombus from an artery.  
These thrombectomy devices work well in large, proximal arteries, but not for distal arterial branches.  
  
**Thrombectomy for a stroke: A** catheter is threaded into an iliac artery of the groin and up through the neck, until it reaches the cerebral blood clot causing the stroke.  
Using fluoroscopy, the device will remove the clot to allow reperfusion.  
  
When used in conjunction with tPA and medical treatments, this method significantly reduces stroke-related disability and mortality.  
  
**3 Types of clot retrieving devices**  
**Coil retrievers -** The trained doctor deploys the loops of the coil through the clot to engage the thrombus, and then pulls both coil and clot back into the catheter, like pulling a cork from a wine bottle.  
**Aspiration devices** : This device devices employs a vacuum aspiration to remove occlusive the occlusive clot.    
**Stent retriever** : A self-expanding stents that are deployed in the occluded vessel within the thrombus, pushing it aside and entangling it within the stent struts. The stent and thrombus are then withdrawn back into the delivery catheter.  
  
**Indications for mechanical thrombectomy for Acute Ischemic Stroke  
**Acute ischemic stroke caused by a proximal large artery occlusion in the **ANTERIOR** circulation.  
_Unfortunately, only around 10 percent of acute ischemic strokes involve a proximal large artery occlusion in the anterior circulation._  
Unsuccessful tPa reperfusion therapy.  
All of the above within 6 to 24 hours onset of stroke symptoms.  
**Posterior circulation stroke:** Benefits of mechanical thrombectomy are still uncertain.It may still be a treatment option for patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by occlusion of the basilar artery, vertebral arteries, or posterior cerebral arteries.  
  
**Most neurointerventionalists will request a systolic BP maintained > 140 mmHg**  
Systolic blood pressure should be maintained between 140-180 mmHg with a reduction in pressure upon recanalization.  
Lowering arterial pressure (especially with general anesthesia) might potentially decrease collateral flow in the penumbral area in the setting of ischemia and impaired autoregulation.  
  
More than 60% of patients present with a superimposed early hypertensive response to brain ischemia for the first 24 hours and this declines by about 25% towards the end of that 24 hour period.  
  
**Possible causes:**  
Patient’s baseline hypertension  
Cushing response to a mass effect of edema  
Neuroendocrine response to physiological stress  
  
**_The Society for Neuroscience in Anesthesia and Critical Care (SNACC)recommends:_**_  
Maintain systolic arterial pressure >140 mm Hg (fluids and vasopressors) and <180 mm Hg (with or without i.v. rtPA).  
  
_**Data from the International Stroke Trial  
**_They suggest that low and high arterial pressure increases death and dependency.  
The lowest risk of death or dependency is at a systolic arterial pressure of 150 mm Hg._  
  
**Mechanical thrombectomy, anesthesia and ergonomics  
**Unfortunately, most of these urgent procedures are in a vascular room with poor ergonomics and space for the anesthesia provider.  
Like most ancillary procedures away from the operating room, there is the inconvenience of urgently transporting a readily stocked anesthesia equipment cart, drug box and anesthesia machine. Many hospitals keep an available anesthesia machine within the area.  
It can be frustrating because after everything is set up and you have all the available equipment and drugs ready, most of these cases are a simple MAC case with an awake patient.  
Time is so important, the neurointensivists will proceed despite you are not fully set up, unless it general anesthesia is required.  
  
**Pre-op  
**Assessment should be quick.  
All labs are usually already present  
  
**In a survey of neurointerventionalists** :  
The main concern was the potential delay to revascularization posed by anesthesia.  
Almost all neurointerventionalists favor conscious sedation or MAC over general anesthesia for this procedure.  
**  
Type of anesthesia for mechanical thrombectomy involving a stroke is still controversial  
**Most of the literature states that general anesthesia has worse outcomes, possibly due to anesthesia related hypotension and a delaying time to recanalization due to anesthesia preparation.  
Some literature states of no difference if systolic blood pressure is maintained over 140 mmHg.  
  
**Local anesthesia or sedation (including monitored anesthesia care) is the most popular  
Advantage of local anesthesia or MAC sedation**  
Easier to maintain smoother hemodynamics due to the decreased administration of pharmacological vasodilators, and allow intra-procedural clinical neurological evaluation.  
  
**Goal of MAC with mechanical thrombectomy  
**Provide airway support  
Assure proper oxygenation  
Maintain BP as requested to assure proper perfusion of the penumbra  
Keep patient immobile (especially head movement) and comfortable  
  
**Disadvantage of local anesthesia or MAC sedation  
**Patients complain of pain during mechanical clot retrieval.   
Lack of airway protection. 2.5% of patients will have an airway protection issue.  
Possible continued patient movement with agitation.  
Possible uncontrolled pain and agitation.  
Prolonged procedure time.  
  
**Anesthesia:** Mostly MAC.  
General anesthesia, MAC or conscious sedation may be used depending upon patient’s status and neurointerventionalists preference.  
  
**Note:** Studies suggest general anesthesia has worse outcomes, this is controversial.  
Conscious sedation, or no sedation, allow continuous neurologic monitoring, minimal delays, and potentially improved hemodynamic stability  
  
**Sedation:** Versed is usually not administered.  
50-100 mcg of fentanyl is common. Clot aspiration maybe painful and the patient needs to keep the head motionless during this time.  
  
**Induction:** RSI if intubation is required.  
**Airway issues:** Usually not an issue and  
Most are MAC cases involving minimal airway protection seems to be an issue in 2.5% of cases.  
  
**Regional:** Not indicated  
  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Optional when intubated. Keep patient motionless**Position** : Supine with arms tucked via sledge. Make sure you will have access to the arterial line transducer or port to draw requested ACTs.  
**Duration:** 90 minutes to 4 hours  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 1-2 20 gauge is acceptable**A-line:** Yes, continuous and a strict regulated blood pressure is important.  
  
The neurointerventionalists will request a certain blood pressure range during the procedure and after the clot is retrieved with reperfusion.  
**Heparinization:** Yes  
**Protamine:** Always have a drawn up syringe readily available to immediately reversal heparization in case of onset of cerebral bleed.  
**Neosynephrine drip:** Yes, especially with general anesthesia inducing hypotension.**Age Range:** Adults, usually < than 80 years.**Hydration:** Minimal, these patients are also receiving volumes with catheter flushing through the procedural catheters.**Emergence:** If the patient was already intubated, they will most likely remain intubated.  
Most of these are urgent procedures without being NPO and awake extubation is common.  
  
**Possible Complication  
**Malignant edema  
Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP)  
Cerebral hemorrhage   
Increased ischemia  
**  
More Notes  
**The Society for Neuroscience in Anesthesia and Critical Care (SNACC) has recommended that systolic arterial pressure should be maintained >140 mm Hg (fluids and vasopressors) and <180 mmHg (with or without i.v. rtPA), and diastolic arterial pressure <105 mmHg (class IIa, level of evidence B). After successful recanalization, arterial pressure targets should be adjusted to avoid potential hemorrhagic conversion.
