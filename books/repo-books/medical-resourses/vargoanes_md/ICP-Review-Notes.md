### ICP (Intracranial Pressure) Review Notes

Except ketamine, all drugs used in induction (thiopental, versed, propofol, etomidate) decrease CBF, CMRO2 and ICP, thus having a cerebral protective effect (by decreasing cerebral oxygen consumption).

The ICP is the number that represents the pressure inside the head. This pressure is the reflection of cerebral autoregulatory systems that balance the pressures of the brain volume, CBF and CSF.  

ICP and CBF affect one another. An increase in ICP may impede CBF and cause ischemia. In other words, if the parenchyma gets squeezed, then the perfusion is going to get worse and may cause ischemia.

Normal ICP depends on age and body posture.  
Normal ICP in a supine healthy adult is seen below.  

Vertical position: ICP is NEGATIVE with an approximate mean of −10 mm Hg but not exceeding −15 mm Hg.

If cerebral auto regulation is intact, an increase in MAP will quickly lead to a compensatory cerebral vasoconstriction with reductions of both CBV and ICP.  
If cerebral auto regulation is impaired, an increase in MAP will increase CBV and ICP. 

Opposite effects will occur when MAP is reduced.

We know that cerebral autoregulation is impaired with general anesthesia.  
  
ICP varies directly with CBF.  
A sustained raise in ICP and a CBF are associated with ischemia and poor outcome after brain injury.  
The gold standard for assessing ICP is an intraventricular drain inserted into one of the lateral ventricles and connected to an external pressure transducer.

The Foramen of Monro or, for clinical purposes, the external auditory meatus is the reference point for zeroing a transducer and repetitive zeroing may be performed after insertion of the catheter.

ICP is the same as Supratentorial CSF Pressure measured in lateral ventricles or over the cerebral cortex. 

The cranial vault (within the cranium) is a rigid structure with a fixed total volume, consisting of:  
Blood (12%)  
CSF (8%)  
Any increase in one component must be offset by another to prevent a rise in ICP, thus maintaining a state of equilibrium. The modified Monro-Kellie hypothesis is based on the above.

ICP is also used to calculate CPP (CPP=MAP−ICP).

ICP is regulated by the rate of CSF formation and resistance to reabsorption through the arachnoid villi. Arachnoid villi within the subarachnoid space absorb CSF continuously into the venous layers of the brain. Any obstruction to reabsorption increases ICP.

Cisterns, which are reservoirs within the subarachnoid space, contain CSF and are potential collection sites for blood clots after a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

**Possible Complications of Increased ICP**  
Death  
Permanent neurological problems  
Reversible neurological problems  
Seizures and Stroke  
  
**Early Symptoms of Increased ICP**  
Decreased LOC, confusion, restlessness, lethargy, difficulty with memory and thinking.  
Pupillary dysfunction  
Changes in vision  
Deterioration of motor function  
Headache  
  
**Later Symptoms of Increased ICP**  
Continued decrease in level of LOC (stuporous, comatose)  
Dilated pupils, no reaction to light  
Hemiplegia that progresses  
Vomiting  
HTN, bradycardia  
Hyperthermia  
Papiledema  
Herniation syndromes  
  
**Herniation:** when the brain tries to escape downwards through the foramen magnum. Herniation pretty much equals death.  

**Cushing Reflex**: a physiological nervous system response to an increased ICP that results in an increased systolic and pulse pressure, decreased HR and RR.  
  
**Causes of Increased ICP:**  
Valsalva maneuvers  
Coughing  
Suctioning  
Noxious stimuli   
Seizure activity  
Lowering the head of the bed

Aneurysm rupture  
Subarachnoid hemorrhage

Brain tumor

Encephalitis

Head injury

Hydrocephalus (increased fluid around the brain)

Hypertensive brain hemorrhage

Intraventricular hemorrhage

Meningitis

Subdural hematoma

Stroke

  
ICP > 15mmHg in infants should be treated.  
ICP >18 mmHg in children < 8 years should be treated.  
ICP >20 mmHg in older children and teenagers should be treated.

The rationale of any CPP augmentation is to increase CBF in brain regions, which have critically low blood flow. However, an increase in CPP will only lead to an increase in CBF when autoregulation has failed or CPP is below the lower limit of autoregulation.

In a normal brain, CBF is constant in the CPP range of about 50–150 mmHg because of autoregulation.  
  
**Methods to decrease ICP**  
HOB up  
Hyperventilation  
CSF drainage  
Mannitol  
Diuretics-Lasix  
Corticosteroids  
Barbiturates
