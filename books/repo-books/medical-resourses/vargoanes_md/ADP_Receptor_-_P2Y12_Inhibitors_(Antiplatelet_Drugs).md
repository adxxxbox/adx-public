ADP Receptor / P2Y12 Inhibitors (Antiplatelet Drugs)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### ADP Receptor / P2Y12 Inhibitors (Antiplatelet Drugs)

When the **P2Y12** platelet receptor interacts with **ADP**, it inhibits the **GPIIb/IIIa** receptors on the surface of the platelets from binding with fibrinogen for platelet aggregation.  
Fibrinogen links all the platelets together for platelet aggregation.  
  
**ADP Inhibitors:  
**Clopidogrel (Plavix, Duoplavin)  
Prasugrel (Effient, Efient)  
Ticagrelor (Brilligue)  
Ticlopidin (Ticlid)  
Elinorel  
Cangrelor  
  
**Note:** Clopidogrel and Prasugrel are prodrugs, meaning it is their metabolites that do the work.  
  
**Thienopyridines  
Necleotide/Nucleoside Analogs**  
  
**Thienopyridines  
**Clopidogrel (Plavix)  
Ticlopidine (Ticlid)Prasugrel (Effient, Efient)  
  
**Necleotide/Nucleoside Analogs  
**Ticagrelar (Brilinta, Brilique, Possia)  
Elinorel  
Cangrelor  
  
The **Thienopyridines** are a class of platelet inhibitors that act by blocking the binding of ADP to the platelet ADP receptor (P2Y12). This prevents the binding of ADP to the receptor which attenuates platelet aggregation and reaction of platelets to stimuli of thrombus aggregation such as thrombin.  
  
ADP antagonists are also considered P2Y12 receptor antagonists.

The release of ADP by an activated platelet binds to ADP receptors on nearby platelets triggering their activation as well. This process helps to create platelet activation important for platelet aggregation at sites of injury. By blocking the binding of ADP to its receptor, thienopyridines serve to inhibit this cascade of platelet aggregation.  
  
**Indications  
**Thienopyridines are frequently used in combination with aspirin during an acute myocardial infarction and will be prescribed after coronary artery stenting. They are frequently used after cerebrovascular accident (CVA) for prophylaxis against a recurrence.  
  
Ticlopidine has been associated with neutropenia and TTP-HUS, thus clopidogrel (Plavix) is more frequently used.  
  
**Antidote:** None  
**Reversal:** Platelets  
  
**More Notes**  
Blockade of the effects of ADP at either of these receptors results in a marked reduction in the overall effect of ADP on platelet function.  
  
Interaction of ADP with the P2Y 12 receptor results in inhibition of adenylate cyclase, which is accompanied by platelet aggregation.  
  
The latter is mediated by a change in conformation of glycoprotein complexes on the platelet surface known as GPIIb/IIIa complexes, such that they become receptors for fibrinogen.  
  
Fibrinogen is a bivalent molecule present in high concentrations in blood plasma. Once bound to some of the 50,000–100,000 GPIIb/IIIa complexes on a single platelet, fibrinogen links the GPIIb/IIIa on adjacent platelets together. The result is that individual single platelets are transformed into a large mass in which many hundreds of thousands of platelets have aggregated together.
