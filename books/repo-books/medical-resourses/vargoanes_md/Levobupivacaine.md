# Levobupivacaine

**Levobupivacaine (Chirocaine)(Levo)**  
**Class:** Amide type Local Anesthetic  
Levobupivacaine is the S (-)-enantiomer of Bupivacaine.  
**Epinephrine** has no/little effect on onset, duration or systemic absorption.  
Produces sensory and motor blockade that is similar to Bupivacaine.  
Causes less myocardial depression than both Bupivacaine and Ropivacaine, despite being in higher concentrations.  
Compared to Bupivacaine, it has less vasodilation and has a longer duration of action.  
**Infiltration 0.25%**  
**Onset:** Fast  
**Duration:** 120-480 mins  
**Max Dose:** 2.5mg/kg or 175mg  
**Peripheral Nerve Block, 0.25 - 0.5%**  
**Onset:** Slow  
**Duration:** 840-1,020 mins  
**Max Dose:** 2.5mg/kg or 175mg  
**Epidural 0.5-0.75%**  
**Onset:** Moderate  
**Onset of sensory block:** 15-30 min  
**Duration:** 300-400 mins  
**Max Dose:** 2.5mg/kg or 175mg  
Increasing both volume and concentration to 20 mL of 0.75% of Levo is associated with a high incidence of hypotension (82%) and delayed block regression.  
0.25% 6 mL/hour offers better analgesia than same volume and less concentrated solutions of Levo (0.125% and 0.0625%). Longer motor blockade may be expected with higher concentrations. (Murdoch et al 2002).  
(Dernedde and colleagues) encourage higher concentrations of Levo with smaller volume for epidural infusion (ie, 3 mL/h of 0.5% or 2 mL/hour of 0.75%). This provides similar quality of analgesia as the small concentration-large volume infusion (10 mL/hour of 0.15%) but with less motor block and significantly increased hemodynamic stability.  
**Spinal 0.5-0.75%**  
**Onset:** Fast  
**Duration:** 60-360 mins  
**Max Dose:** 20mg  
**Epidural Peak levels:** 30 mins  
doses up to 150 mg resulted in mean CMAX levels of up to 1.2 mcg/mL.  
The effective dose of continuous postoperative analgesia approaches 15 mg/hour  
**Protein binding: 97%**  
**Half life:** 3 hours  
**MOA:** Like other local anesthetics, it binds to the intracellular portion of sodium channels and blocks sodium influx into nerve cells, which prevents depolarization.  
**In Detail:** Prevents transmission of nerve impulses by inhibiting the passage of Na ions through their specific channels. It is speculated that local anesthetics bind to specific sites on the inner portion of the Na channels (internal gate or H gate) near their external openings to maintain those channels in an inactivated state.  
**Metabolized:** Liver and Kidneys  
**Excreted:** Kidneys  
Regardless of the type of regional blockade with Levo, 78% of patients may experience at least one adverse effect such as:  
Hypotension (20%)  
Nausea (12%)  
Postoperative pain (18%)  
Fever (17%)  
Vomiting (14%)  
Anemia (12%)  
Pruritus (9%),  
Back pain (8%)  
Headache (7%)  
Constipation (7%)  
Dizziness (6%)  
Fetal distress (5%)
