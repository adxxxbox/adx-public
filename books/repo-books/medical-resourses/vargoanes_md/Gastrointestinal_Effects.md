### Gastrointestinal Effects

Since sympathetic outflow originates at T5-L1, neuraxial blockade results in a sympathectomy with a predomination of parasympathetic nervous system effects.  
  
The end result is a small, contracted gut with peristalsis.  
  
Hepatic blood flow decreases in relation to decreases in mean arterial pressure but does not differ significantly from other anesthetic techniques. Postoperative epidural analgesia enhances the return of gastrointestinal function.
