### Deep Hypothermic Cardiac Arrest (DHCA) and Brain Protection

There is a lot of literature concerning optimal brain protection and DHCA. It appears that we see or exercise only a fraction of what is published and the patients still seem to do well.  
  
Concerning Anesthesia, we usually participate with just placing ice bags over the patient’s head. Literature tells us about EEG Burst Suppression by administering Thiopental, Propofol and Isoflurane. Well it is hard to find Thiopental, we usually don’t administer Propofol during DHCA and the Perfusionist controls the Isoflurane during bypass.

Many times these aneurysms extend to the origin of the innominate artery; a brief period of circulatory arrest to resect the aneurysm and perform a distal anastomosis is needed.  
This means they need to temporarily cut the flow of blood to the brain to repair the aneurysm. In the mean time, they apply techniques to protect the brain from cerebral ischemia.

**DHCA and Brain Protection Notes**

Various anesthetics have the ability to produce EEG Burst Suppression and result in profound decreases in cerebral metabolic rate to approximately 50% of awake CMRo2, averaging 1.5 mL/(100 g · min).

**Thiopental**  
A dosage of 5 to 8 mg/kg results in 5 minutes of EEG suppression at normothermia. Proportional decreases in both CBF and CMRo2 are produced. An infusion at 0.5 to 1.0 mg/(kg · min) is required for prolonged EEG suppression; results in prolonged recovery and extubation times; and may increase the need for inotropic support because of myocardial depression.

**Propofol**  
Transient EEG burst suppression is obtained at dosages of 2 to 3 mg/kg and results in proportional decreases in CBF and CMRo2. Infusion at 0.1 to 0.3 mg/(kg · min) produces sustained EEG suppression and is rapidly metabolized; therefore, it does not prolong recovery and extubation times. Hypotension from systemic vasodilation may require administration of phenylephrine or other such vasoconstrictor.

**Isoflurane**  
At inspired concentrations of 2% to 3% (1.5 to 2 MAC), burst suppression is produced. Unlike the intravenous agents, EEG suppression with isoflurane is not accomplished by any decrease in CBF, although CMRo2 is significantly reduced. Rapid elimination is characteristic of volatile anesthetics.

**Temperature**  
**Hypothermia is the primary component of brain protection during circulatory arrest.** Dropping cerebral temperature down to 20°C greatly enhances cerebral tolerance for ischemia. Application of external ice packs to the head have been shown experimentally to delay brain rewarming and increase ischemic tolerance. Thiopental and/or steroids are administered before circulatory arrest in some centers, although any beneficial effect is unproved. Rewarming is essential.

Anterograde and Retrograde perfusion of cerebral to the brain during deep hypothermia have been shown to significantly improve cerebral ischemic tolerance in comparison to total circulatory arrest.  

**Antegrade Perfusion**

When aortic arterial inflow is restricted, selective cerebral perfusion is given through the brachiocephalic or carotid cannula just as it would under normal circulation.  

**Retrograde Cerebral Perfusion**  
Perfusion to the brain through the SVC cannula (going through the back door) has also been successful.

**Temperature Readings**: Nasopharyngeal, esophageal and bladder temperatures are important for estimating brain and core temperatures for monitoring the conduct of DHCA.  

Monitoring of jugular bulb venous oxygen saturation and the EEG may reflect cerebral metabolic activity to guide the conduct of DHCA.
