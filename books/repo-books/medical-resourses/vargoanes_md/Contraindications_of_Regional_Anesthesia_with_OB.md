Nonreassuring fetal heart tones ARE NOT a contraindication to regional analgesia. However, some providers may be reluctant to recommend epidural anesthesia in this situation. The prior placement of a functioning epidural catheter may allow rapid extension of the block, should cesarean delivery be required for fetal distress.
