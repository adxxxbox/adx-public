### Types of Insulin

**Quick Review:  
**Insulin can be administered IV, IM and SQ.  
Insulin is an anabolic peptide hormone that is produced by and secreted from beta cells of  
the islets of Langerhans, within the pancreas.  
_A healthy person secretes insulin at a basal rate of 0.5 – 0.7 units/hour.  
  
_Insulin promotes the storage of carbohydrates, amino acids, and fat in the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissues.  
By enhancing the glucose absorption from the blood, insulin lowers blood glucose levels.  
A deficiency in insulin results in hyperglycemia.  
  
Insulin is an important part of treatment for individuals with insufficient or absent insulin production (e.g., diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes).  
  
There are several different analogs of insulin that are related to human insulin. These have a different molecular structure and differ in onset, peak, and duration compared to human insulin.  
The administration of insulin inhibits its endogenous secretion from the pancreas.  
Insulin stimulates the Na+, K+, and ATPase activity, and thus lowers plasma potassium.  
Exogenous (administered) insulin is cleared by the kidneys.  
Endogenous (secreted) insulin is cleared by the liver.  
  
**Indications for Insulin**  
Type 1 diabetes mellitus  
Type 2 diabetes mellitus if weight normalization, physical activity, and oral antidiabetic drugs do not keep blood glucose levels in the target range.  
All Type 2 diabetic patients with end stage renal failure (oral antidiabetic drugs are contraindicated).  
Pancreatic insufficiency with secondary diabetes.  
Gestational diabetes, if change of diet is not sufficient.  
Acute hyperkalemia: a drip containing regular insulin, and a solution of glucose reduces serum potassium levels.  
  
**Side Effects of Insulin**  
Hypoglycemia  
Weight gain  
Lipodystrophy at the injection site  
Pain and erythema at injection site  
Hypokalemia  
Allergic reactions (rare)  
Edema (rare)

**Rapid-acting insulin** table.tableizer-table { font-size: 12px; border: 1px solid #CCC; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; } .tableizer-table td { padding: 4px; margin: 3px; border: 1px solid #CCC; } .tableizer-table th { background-color: #104E8B; color: #FFF; font-weight: bold; }

| Types of Insulin | Effects | Application | Special features |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Insulin lispro  
Insulin aspart  
Insulin glulisine | Onset: 5-30 minutes  
Peak: 30 min-3 hours  
Duration: 3-5 hours | Intensifies conventional  
insulin therapy. | Used before meals.  
Used in combination with  
long-acting insulins. |

  
**Short-acting insulin  
**_The insulin utilized perioperatively for sliding scales and continuous infusions_ table.tableizer-table { font-size: 12px; border: 1px solid #CCC; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; } .tableizer-table td { padding: 4px; margin: 3px; border: 1px solid #CCC; } .tableizer-table th { background-color: #104E8B; color: #FFF; font-weight: bold; }

| Types of Insulin | Effects | Application | Special features |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Regular Insulin  
Regular (R) or novolin | Onset: 30 minutes  
Peak: 2.5 - 5 hours  
Duration: 4-24 hours | Conventional insulin therapy.  
The standard insulin used perioperatively,  
and in acute settings with sliding scales. | Commonly administered IV  
per anesthesia sliding scales.  
Mandatory interval between  
injections and meal times: ∼30 min.  
Used in combination with longer-acting insulin. |

  
  
Regular IV insulin remains physiologically active for approximately 1 hour, but has a serum half-life of 7 minutes.  
Therefore, it allows for tight glycemic control that can combat unexpected changes in blood glucose effectively.  
  
**Intermediate acting insulin** table.tableizer-table { font-size: 12px; border: 1px solid #CCC; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; } .tableizer-table td { padding: 4px; margin: 3px; border: 1px solid #CCC; } .tableizer-table th { background-color: #104E8B; color: #FFF; font-weight: bold; }

| Types of Insulin | Effects | Application | Special features |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NPH insulin  
(neutral protamine Hagedorn) | Onset: 1 - 2 hour  
Peak: 4 - 12 hours  
Duration: 14 - 24 hours | Component of basal  
supported oral therapy (BOT)  
for treatment-resistant  
Type 2 diabetes mellitus. | Mandatory interval between  
injections and meal times: 30-60 min.  
Used in combination with rapid or  
short-acting insulin.  
Usually administered BID. |

  
**Long-acting insulin** table.tableizer-table { font-size: 12px; border: 1px solid #CCC; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; } .tableizer-table td { padding: 4px; margin: 3px; border: 1px solid #CCC; } .tableizer-table th { background-color: #104E8B; color: #FFF; font-weight: bold; }

| Type of Insulin | Effect | Application | Special features |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lantus (glargine)  
Glargine U-300 (Toujeo)  
Levemer (detemir)  
Degludec (Ideg, Tresiba)  
Humalin N | Onset: 1.5 - 4 hours  
Peak: Flat; not defined  
Duration: ∼24 hours  
Degludec: ∼42 hours | Component of basal supported oral therapy (BOT)  
for treatment-resistant  
type 2 diabetes mellitus. | The newer analogs are more efficacious  
and longer in duration compared to NPH insulin.  
Used in combination with rapid or short-acting insulin.  
Administered once a day or BID. |
