### Epidural Catheter Insertion (step by step)

_Dr. Alyson Eastep, CRNA Summerton, SC_

**Catheter Placement  
**_The bevel of needle is directed cephalad.  
Catheter is advanced 3 to 4 cm beyond needle tip.  
The needle is then withdrawn while feeding the catheter through.  
The length of the catheter remaining outside the skin is noted and if more than 4 cm has been introduced the excess is withdrawn.  
The catheter is then secured and the dose injected.  
  
_**Detailed Description  
**Time out is performed by RN  
  
**Monitoring Equipment -** Pulse ox, BP and EKG**Emergency airway equipment** \- should be at bedside  
**Monitoring Equipment -** Have RN place NIPB and pulse ox FHR should be monitored throughout.  
**Epidural Infusion Mixture** \- Place it in pump (see epidural infusion mixtures)  
**Program PCEA Pump** (see PCEA programming)  
**  
Position the patient (sitting or lateral) and assess the anatomy of the lumbar spine  
**Have RN assist the patient to stand and move towards the head of the bed to avoid sitting in the break of the labor beds which can distort the midline-or lateral position. Should be patient preference.  
If parturient is sitting, make sure the positioning helper keeps the patient motionless while being directly in front.  
  
**Identify the landmarks  
**1\. Identify landmarks (palpate hip bones and spinous processes; draw a mental line from the hip bone to the intersection of the spinous processes) and mark with your fingernail impression. My target is L3-L4. Some people start at L4-L5.  
2\. Give nurse your syringe containing the bolus mixture you have prepared  
3\. Don mask, head covering, and sanitize hands  
4\. Open epidural kit  
5\. Don sterile gloves  
6\. Clean back with approved solution at several levels  
7\. Apply sterile drape with hole positioned at anticipated insertion point (you should be able to see your fingernail impression)  
8\. Open all ampules/vials and line up equipment in order of use while cleaning solution is drying  
9\. Draw up local anesthetic for skin wheal using filter straw into the 3cc syringe, attach preferred injection needle.  
10\. Draw up test dose in 10cc syringe using filter straw (if you are worried about confusing the local anesthetic with the test dose, you can wait to open test dose until after you have successfully placed the epidural catheter)  
11\. Lubricate loss or resistance (LOR) syringe by drawing up and squirting out the saline several times.  
12\. Remove the 20cc syringe from kit and instruct the nurse to inject the bolus mixture into the syringe while you are holding it up (with a nervous nurse this can be tricky especially if your hand isn't steady)  
13\. Wipe excess cleaning solution from the desired insertion point with included 4x4s  
14\. Inject skin wheal at insertion point (your fingernail mark should still be visible)  
15\. As you are injecting local, attempt to identify structures and bone to determine insertion angle  
16\. Once local is injected and angle is identified, unscrew syringe from the needle leaving the needle inserted in patient's back  
17\. Draw up saline, air, or a combination of both into the LOR syringe (provider preference)  
18\. Remove local needle, and insert Tuohy in the exact hole, using the exact trajectory as the local needle.  
19\. As you are inserting, wiggle the Tuohy up and down, feeling for the needle to become seated in ligamentum flavum. You will notice a definite stiffing of the needle to movement once you have reached ligamentum flavum.  
_(In midline insertions, I (and the US Army) teach students to insert the needle with stylet into ligamentous (supraspinous or interspinous) tissue, then attach the LOR syringe and insert further Jim Carrol, CRNA.)_  
20\. When you feel you have reached ligamentum flavum, remove the stylet from the Tuohy and attach the loss or resistance (LOR) glass syringe.  
21\. Tap the syringe plunger or apply constant pressure as you slowly insert the Tuohy in tiny increments at a time (in some people, the ligamentum flavum can feel extremely hard and require significant pressure to advance needle).  
22\. Once the contents of the syringe are easily injectable, from the loss of resistance, remove the LOR syringe  
23\. After you remove the syringe and observe CLEAR FLUID coming out of the Tuohy, you have pierced the dura. You now have the option to either insert the epidural catheter in the subarachnoid space, or remove the Tuohy. _please see wet tap section_  
24\. If patient is not having paresthesia and no CSF fluid is observed, begin inserting the epidural catheter (some providers like to open up the epidural space by injecting saline before they attempt to insert the epidural catheter)  
31\. Observe in the needle hub for the thick, black, solid line (12-13cm mark) on the epidural catheter, this indicates that the catheter is at the tip of the needle.  
25\. Insert the catheter an additional 3-5cm by counting the small hash marks in the needle hub as you advance the catheter.  
**Reference some anesthesia providers use-below:**  
advance only 3cm for skinny person  
advance 5cm for average person  
advance 8cm obese person  
26\. Once you are at the desired depth, ask patient if she is having any paresthesia, if no, measure  
      the catheter using provider's preferred technique.Note: Do not pull back the epidural catheter for any reason during the process of passing it through Epidural Needle. Always withdraw epidural needle first, then adjust the catheter. Otherwise there is a risk of cutting or shredding the epidural catheter by the epidural needle bevel.  
27\. Remove epidural needle while slowly advancing the catheter  
28\. Ensure the catheter measures at the skin the same distance (cm marking) it did prior to the Tuohy removal.  
**Note:** Before you start to pull back remove the Tuohy while simultaneously inserting the catheter even more, ensure that the initial depth of insertion is known by measurement of the catheter using the provider’s preferred technique. We insert the catheter even more while removing the Tuohy because it is much easier to pull the catheter out to match the point of reference, than it is to re-advance the catheter. You CANNOT re-advance an epidural catheter without the presence of the Tuohy needle!.  
29\. Note the cm marking at the skin for documentation.  
30\. Allow the patient to sit up from the epidural placement position, if in the sitting position (if in the lateral position allow them to unflex a bit). It is important, especially in the obese, to have the patient assume an un-flexed position prior to securing the catheter at the skin. Having the patient extend a little may cause the catheter to be passively pulled deeper as the position of the subcutaneous soft tissue changes. I have patients assume an exaggerated lordotic position prior to catheter fixation. In the obese parturient, the position of the soft tissue and skin insertion site relative to the catheter may change by a cm or two. Especially in the obese, this shifting of tissue may even displace the catheter if the catheter is secured while the patient maintains a flexed (kyphotic) posture.  
31\. Attach the clamp, included in the kit, to the end of catheter  
32\. Give test dose and instruct patient of symptoms to report  
(see test doses)  
33\. If negative test dose, attach bolus syringe  
(see negative test dose)  
34\. After a negative aspiration, give a bolus in 5cc increments of your local anesthetic you are using. If you prefer to bolus sitting (some providers like to administer half of the bolus with the patient sitting, some like to give it all when they are supine)  
35\. Before patient is placed supine (with uterine displacement), ensure the catheter is secured with a sterile tegaderm (some providers allow the obese patient to lie down in the lateral position before securing the catheter so it does not pull out of the epidural space with position changes)  
36\. Place tape from the insertion site tegaderm, up to the patient’s shoulder to ensure the catheter does not become dislodged with movement and position changes  
37\. Ensure patient is positioned completely flat and not tipped to either side with head of bed only slightly elevated and give remainder of bolus (Or begin the bolus in 5cc increments after negative aspiration if you prefer to bolus the patient supine). Remember-initial administration volume is 10cc to achieve the level of T-10. Before you start pump infusion. Caution: supine hypotensive syndrome may occur if the patient is completely flat. Epidural block is less sensitive to “lateralizing” than is a hyperbaric spinal anesthetic.  
38\. Begin infusion at 10 cc per hour of your local anesthetic of choice  
(for patients < 7cm cervical dilated)46. By the time you are finished documenting, the patient should have significant pain relief; if not, troubleshoot the epidural.
