### Grafts (Conduits) for CABG and Longevity

Since arterial grafts have higher patency rates, widespread use of arterial grafts instead of saphenous vein grafts should reduce CABG mortality.  
  
**Arteries:**  
**LIMA: Left internal mammary artery** (left internal thoracic artery)  
Usually grafted to the Left Anterior Descending Artery (LAD). Has greatest long term patency - 90% at 10 years.  
  
**RIMA: Right internal mammary artery** (right internal thoracic artery)  
Usually grafted to the circumflex system. Second in preference to LIMA.  
Like the LIMA, it has greatest long term patency - 90% at 10 years.  
  
**Radial Artery:** from the forearm Third choice after LIMA and RIMA. Safe, but has not yet shown to improve late survival.  
  
**(RGEA) right gastroepiploic artery:** one of the two terminal branches of the gastroduodenal artery. Rarely used, difficult and time consuming to access.  
Usually grafted to the posterior interventricular artery (PIV). Has not shown to improve survival.  
Similar to the radial artery, it is prone to spasm and therefore should only be used to bypass coronary arteries that are severely stenotic.  
1-year patency rate - 91%  
5-year patency rate - 80%  
10-year patency rates - 62%

The inferior epigastric artery is only 8 to 10 centimeters in length and therefore is usually used as a “Y” or “T” graft connected to another arterial conduit. On occasion it is used as a free graft from the aorta to a high diagonal branch of the LAD artery. Because it is muscular artery, it is prone to spasm and therefore is best used to bypass a severely stenotic coronary artery.  
  
**Veins  
(SVGs) greater or lesser saphenous vein grafts:** The saphenous vein is the large (subcutaneous) superficial vein of the leg and thigh.  
The saphenous vein is long enough that if its whole length is taken, it can be used to bypass at least three coronary arteries.  
10% to 25% of them occlude within 1 year .  
In addition, 1% to 2% occlude each year during the 1 to 5 years after surgery.  
4% to 5% occlude each year between 6 and 10 years postoperatively.  
50% patency at 10 years in 50% of the patients.  
90% patency at 10 years in 25% of the patients.  
  
Therefore, 10 years after CABG, 50% to 60% of SVGs are patent, only half of which have no angiographic evidence of atherosclerosis.  
  
During SVG harvesting and initial exposure to arterial pressure, the endothelium often is damaged, which, if extensive, may lead to platelet aggregation and graft thrombosis. Platelet adherence to the endothelium begins the process of intimal hyperplasia that later causes SVG atherosclerosis. After adhering to the intima, the platelets release mitogens that stimulate smooth muscle cell mitosis, leading to intimal proliferation and hyperplasia. Lipid is incorporated into these areas of intimal hyperplasia, resulting in atherosclerotic plaque formation. The perioperative administration of aspirin and dipyridamole improves early.  
  
Cholesterol-lowering agents contribute to higher patency rates.
