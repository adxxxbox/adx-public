### Nerve Fiber, Nociceptive, Proprioception Review Notes

**Labor Pain  
**Uterine contractions and cervical dilatation result in visceral pain. These pain impulses are transmitted by afferent, slow conducting, A-delta and C fibers that accompany the sympathetic nerves and enter the spinal cord at the T10 to L1 level.  
  
**Afferent Nerves** \- Sensory and send their impulse to the spinal cord.**Efferent Nerves** \- Motor and send their impulses from the spinal cord.  
  
Neural pathways from the left side of the body terminate in the right hemisphere of the brain, and vice versa.  
**Nociceptors -** refers to pain**Proprioception -** non pain sensory (position sense)These nociceptors respond only when a stimulus is strong enough to threaten the body’s integrity (cause injury).  
  
**Nociceptors (pain receptors)**  
Are unspecialized, free nerve endings.  
They convert (transduce) a variety of stimuli into nerve impulses, which the brain interprets to produce the sensation of pain.  
The cell bodies of these Nociceptors are all the way back in the DORSAL root ganglia of the spinal cord.  
You only have to remember that pain travels back to the dorsal roots (except trigeminal-which does not pertain to this topic).  
  
**Note:** Pay special attention to the A-Delta and C Fibers because those are the fibers we always talk about with labor pain.  
  
**The 2 Types Nociceptors are classified by their fibers (both sensory-afferent)  
C Fibers:** Small in diameter, unmyelinated, conduct slower at 2 m/sec = 7.2 km/h.  
**A-Delta (Aδ):** larger diameter, lightly myelinated nerves that conduct nerve impulses faster  
at 20 m/sec = 72 km/h  
  
**Note:** C fibers are estimated to account for about 70% of all nociceptive fibers.**  
  
C-fiber nociceptors produce the sensation of:  
**Slow and diffuse pain  
Throbbing dull pain  
Temperature  
  
**A-Delta-fiber nociceptors produce the sensation of:  
**Sharp pain  
Fast-rapid localized pain (myelinated)  
  
**Note:** Uterine (visceral) afferent fibers stimulated by pressure are primarily C-fibers and some A-Delta fibers that relay pain to the spinal cord.  
  
**Other Causes of Labor Pain  
**A number of chemical substances(mediators) are produced or released when there is cellular damage and influence the degree of nerve activity; hence, the intensity of the pain sensation.

Selected chemical substances released with stimuli sufficient to cause tissue damage table.tableizer-table { font-size: 12px; border: 1px solid #CCC; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; } .tableizer-table td { padding: 4px; margin: 3px; border: 1px solid #CCC; } .tableizer-table th { background-color: #104E8B; color: #FFF; font-weight: bold; }

| Substance | Source |
| --- | --- |
| Potassium | Damaged cells |
| Serotonin | Platelets |
| Bradykinin | Plasma |
| Histamine | Mast cells |
| Prostaglandins | Damaged cells |
| Leukotrienes | Damaged cells |
| Substance P | Primary nerve afferents |

Labor pain from uterine contractions may also result from myometrial ischemia, which causes the release of potassium, bradykinin, histamine and serotonin.  
  
**Proprioception (non pain fibers)  
**Pertains to positon sense.Also allows us to control limbs without directly looking at them.  
We also have other non-painful sensory pathways for temperature etc.  
  
_We tend to pay less attention to the sensory nerve fibers below because they do not deal with the pain we are trying to block with regional anesthesia. But we still must know of them.  
  
_**There are non-nociceptive (non-pain) nerve fibers we  
see mentioned are:**  
A-alpha - afferent (proprioception) and efferent (motor-muscle length and force).  
A-beta - afferent (proprioception) and efferent (skeletal muscle and joints).  
A-gamma - motor-efferent, muscle tone.  
B fibers - preganglionic - autonomic.  
sC fibers - postganglionic sympathetic.  
  
**A-Alpha  
**Consist of sensory (afferent) proprioception (position sense).  
Efferent – Somatic motor .  
Adjust skeletal muscle force and length.  
  
**A-Gamma  
**Efferent motor to muscle spindles and deal with muscle tone.  
  
**A-Beta (touch and myelinated)  
**Pre ganglionic autonomic-with autonomic functions.  
The sensory fibers are responsible for proprioception (position sense).  
  
**sC Fiber  
**Post ganglionic sympathetic.
