### Heparin Review & Types

**_Unfractionated Heparin_**  
Unfractionated heparin was originally isolated from canine liver cells in 1916.  
  
Today's production, is usually purified from bovine lung and porcine intestinal sources.  
**Molecular weight:** 12 to 15 kd.  
  
Unfractionated heparin acts through accelerating the activity of antithrombin.  
Therapeutic doses are administered intravenously, which requires hospital care.  
It must be monitored with laboratory testing, either for its effect on activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) or for its anti-Xa activity.  
  
Heparins bind to antithrombin III and potently ENHANCE antithrombin III’s inhibitory effect on activated thrombin and Factor X. When heparin binds to antithrombin III, it potentiates the activity of by 2,000 times. This process INHIBITS the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.  
  
**Heparin Indications:**  
Acute treatment of thromboembolic event  
(DVT, PE, CVA, ACS)  
Early treatment of AMI  
Cardiac surgery  
Vascular surgery  
During and after PTCA, PCI  
Select patients with acute stroke, unstable angina, atrial fibrillation, pre-cardioversion, prophylaxis of DVT and PT in high risk pts.  
  
**Two classes of Heparin****1) Unfractionated Heparin (UFH) –** the original heparin (UFH), is a crude mixture of variable length polysaccharides derived from porcine intestinal mucosa. Larger in molecular size than the low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).  
  
**2) Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH** **) – newer** **class, smaller in size  
**LMWH, are derived by purification of the smaller molecules within UFH. UFH and LMWH display distinct pharmacological properties that yield different pharmacokinetics and anticoagulation profiles.  
  
**Review of Antithrombin III**  
**Antithrombin III** (ATIII)-INHIBITS coagulation by neutralizing the enzymatic activity of thrombin (factors IIa, IXa, Xa). Prothrombin will not be converted to thrombin.  
  
**UFH:** Promotes antithrombin-mediated inactivation of _both_ factor X and thrombin (low dose).  
  
**LMWH:** Promotes anti-thrombin mediated inactivation of solely thrombin.  
  
**LMWH are becoming more popular  
**LMWH have a greater bioavailability.  
More predictable than heparin.  
Do not need routine monitoring-there is no therapeutic range.  
Dosing adjustmentto reach a target is not recommended.  
Constant coagulation monitoring is unnecessary **–** PTT and INR.  
Can be administered at home.  
Some literature states that LMWH has reduced the risk for extension or recurrence of DVT compared with unfractionated heparin.  
**  
Heparin Doses**  
**Low doses:** Just inactivate factor Xa, inhibit conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.  
**Higher doses:** Inactivate factors IX, X, XI, XII, thrombin, inhibit conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin; also inactivate activated Factor 8.  
  
_Only 1/3 of an administered dose of heparin binds to antithrombin, and this fraction is responsible for most of its anticoagulant effect._  
  
**UFH Lab Monitoring**  
UFH can be monitored by trending the PTT while the PT is affected to a much lesser extent.  
Frequent monitoring of the PTT is necessary during IV administration of UFH as it can swing wildly high during up-titration of UFH.  
  
**Therapeutic doses:** Considered 1.5 to 2-fold that of the normal value of PTT.  
  
**LMWH Lab Monitoring**  
LMWH cannot be monitored by assessing the PTT; however, because of its much more predictable effect on coagulation, laboratory monitoring of coagulation parameters is not necessary.  
  
**Route of Administration**  
Both UFH and LMWH must be administered parenterally, (NEVER IM)!  
  
**UFH:** The anticoagulant effect has a much quicker onset and has a shorter half-life, making it ideal for acute unstable situations which require fast-on times and potentially fast-off times.  
  
**LMWH:** anticoagulant effect of LMWHs are of slower offset with much longer half-lives, making them ideal for stable or outpatient scenarios.  
  
**Reversal  
**Protamine Sulfate **–** a crude mixture of polypeptides derived from salmon sperm that bind and thus inactivate negatively charged heparin residues.  
  
Some literature states that Protamine sulfate only binds to long heparin chains and is thus ineffective against LMWH.  
  
Protamine may be of use in reversing some of the bleeding associated with LMWH but not in all patients. Protamine only partially affects anti-Xa levels.  
  
**Adverse Effects**  
**Most common adverse reaction:** bleeding  
**Most feared complication:** Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT); occurs in 2-5% of patients receiving heparin therapy.  
  
**Treat with direct thrombin inhibitors** \- argatroban or bivalirudin (angiomax).  
  
**Member Drugs  
Unfractionated heparin (UFH)–** Frequently referred to simply as "heparin" in medical facilities.  
  
**Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH)**  
Enoxaparin (Lovenox)  
Certoparin (Embolex)  
Nadroparin (Fraxiparin)  
Reviparin (Clivarin)  
Parnaparin  
Bemiparin  
  
**Fondaparinux (Arixtra)** is an anticoagulant that shares the same pentasaccharide sequence as UFH and LMWH for the binding to antithrombin, however it has no extra chain and thus is not considered a heparin product.
