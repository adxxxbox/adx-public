Factor XIII Deficiency    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Factor XIII Deficiency

**Other names:** Congenital factor XIII deficiency, fibrin stabilizing factor deficiency, or inherited factor XIII deficiency  
  
May be classified as mild, moderate, or severe. The level of severity is determined by the percentage of active clotting factor in the blood (normal percentage ranges from 50 to 150 percent).  
  
Estimated prevalence is 1 in 2,000,000-5,000,000.  
  
Factor XIII (FXIII) deficiency was first reported in the literature in 1960.  
It is the rarest factor deficiency, occurs between between 1 in 2,000,000-5,000,00.  
  
It is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, thus both parents must carry the gene.  
Affects men and women equally.  
  
Acquired factor XIII deficiency can result when the body produces autoantibodies (inhibitors) that attack factor XIII.  
  
**Possible cause for acquired factor XIII deficiency**  
Severe liver disease, chronic kidney (renal) failure, inflammatory bowel disease, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, autoimmune disorders such as lupus or scleroderma, or certain cancers such as myeloid forms of leukemia.  
  
**Factor XIII:** Stabilizes the formation of a blood clot. Without it, a clot will still develop, but will then break down resulting in recurrent bleeds.  
Factor XIII also affects other processes in the body and is known to play a role in proper wound healing and pregnancy.  
  
Some individuals may have only mild symptoms; other individuals may have severe, life-threatening bleeds.  
  
The symptoms of factor XIII deficiency may become apparent at any age, but most patients are diagnosed during infancy.  
  
**Symptoms**  
Umbilical cord bleeding in 80% of cases.  
Spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage occurs up to 30% of patients (leading cause of mortality).  
Bruising.  
Epistaxis.  
Hematomas  
Delayed bleeding after surgery.  
Menorrhagia or repeat miscarriages.  
Ecchymoses.  
  
In most cases, hemorrhages are delayed (12-36hr) after trauma or surgery.  
  
**Labs**  
Clotting tests come back normal.  
FXIII assays.  
PTT/PTT normal.  
  
**Treatment  
Cortifact** is made from the pooled plasma of healthy donors.  
Corifact may develop antibodies against FXIII, making the product ineffective.  
FFP.  
  
Corifact®, FXIII Concentrate (Human), is indicated for routine prophylactic treatment and perioperative management of surgical bleeding in adult and pediatric patients with congenital Factor XIII deficiency. Corifact must be administered intravenously.  
  
Thromboembolic complications have been reported with Corifact; monitor patients with known risk factors for thrombotic events.
