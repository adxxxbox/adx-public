### Endovascular Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (EVAR) Review

**EVAR procedure:  
**Under fluoroscopy, a stent graft is positioned overlying the abdominal aneurysm such that blood flows from the normal artery through the stent graft into the normal artery, thus preventing blood flow in the aneurysmal sac, which will eventually thrombose.  
Stent grafts are usually introduced through the common femoral arteries.  
**  
Abdominal aorta aneurysm review:**  
The average anteroposterior diameter of the abdominal aorta is 2cm (range 1.5-3 cm).  
It is considered to be aneurysmal when it reaches 3 cm in diameter. table.tableizer-table { font-size: 12px; border: 1px solid #CCC; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; } .tableizer-table td { padding: 4px; margin: 3px; border: 1px solid #CCC; } .tableizer-table th { background-color: #104E8B; color: #FFF; font-weight: bold; }

| Size of aneurysm | Annual risk of rupture |
| --- | --- |
| 4-4.9 cm | 0-0.5% |
| 5-5.9 cm | 3-15% |
| 6-6.9 cm | 10-20% |
| 7-7.9 cm | 20-40% |

  
**Aortic aneurysms:  
Age range:** 40-90  
**Incidence:** 1:1,000 in the US  
**Etiology:** Atherosclerosis, infection  
**Advantages and disadvantages of EVAR vs open procedure:** table.tableizer-table { font-size: 12px; border: 1px solid #CCC; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; } .tableizer-table td { padding: 4px; margin: 3px; border: 1px solid #CCC; } .tableizer-table th { background-color: #104E8B; color: #FFF; font-weight: bold; }

| Advantage of EVAR | Disadvantage of EVAR |
| --- | --- |
| Less invasive surgically | More expensive |
| Shorter duration operation (usually <2 hours) | Potential technical difficulty of stent placement. |
| Avoids short- and long-term complications of laparotomy | Failure to obtain adequate seal (common) resulting in endoleak |
| Reduced stress response from open procedure | Delayed displacement of graft and leak necessitating a revision procedure (10-20% within 3 years) |
| Decreased morbidity and mortality | Long-term success rate is still not known |
| Less likely for large blood transfusion | Femoral angioplasty may also be required in some patients to increase the internal diameter of the artery |
| Less likely for coagulopathy from transfusions |   |
| Early ambulation possible (next day usually) |   |
| 50% decrease in length of hospital stay |  |

**  
Risk factors for aneurysms:  
**70% of patients with AAA also have coronary artery disease.Risk factors include age > 60years,  
Male gender (6 times more common than in females)  
Smokers (lifelong smokers are at four times greater risk than non-smokers).  
hypertension,  
Hypercholesterolaemia  
Family history  
Inherited connective tissue diseases such as Marfans or Ehlers Danlos (type IV).  
**  
EVARs are considered an intermediate or high-risk procedure.  
According to The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) joint guidelines:**  
Infra-renal EVAR is an intermediate-risk procedure.  
Complex EVARs should be considered high-risk procedures.**Type of operating room:** HybridEVARs are performed in hybrid operating rooms with appropriate angiography facilities and the ability to convert to an open procedure if required.  
Lead aprons and thyroid shields are required.  
**  
Monitoring:**  
5 lead ECG  
  
**Arterial line:** Should be inserted contralateral to the upper limb surgical access, usually the right hand).  
Also, the surgeon may need  
Hourly urine output  
Core temperature is mandatory.  
Two large bore IVs  
  
**Conversion to an open repair:** < 2%  
**  
Causes for converting to open procedure:**  
Aneurysm rupture  
The inability to deploy the graft from the femoral and iliac vessels is more diseased than anticipated.  
  
**TEG or ROTEM would be available.**  
In case of a severe hemorrhage, a ROTEM or TEG measuring device should be available for the optimal replacement of blood products.  
**  
Anesthetic goals in EVAR:**  
Provide hemodynamic stability  
Preserve perfusion to vital organs  
Avoid imbalance in myocardial oxygen supply and demand.  
Maintenance intravascular volume  
Provide early identification and management of bleeding  
Normothermia.  
  
**Type of anesthesia:**  
There is no evidence to demonstrate one technique’s mortality or morbidity benefits over another.  
  
**EVARs can be performed under:  
**MAC sedation  
Neuraxial  
LMA  
GETA  
**Note:** Most anesthesia providers intubate the patient.  
  
**Advantages of an intubated patient with EVAR:  
**\- The patient’s airway is already secure if an aneurysm rupture occurs during the procedure.  
\- Breath-holding on the ventilator is easy and can be prolonged if necessary, to improve the image quality in digital subtraction angiography.  
\- Depending on the complexity, the procedure may be prolonged extra hours, which may be poorly tolerated by sedated patients.  
  
**Blood pressure control:  
**Ask the surgeon where he wants the blood pressure.Most surgeons want the systolic BP to remain less than 180 mmHg.  
Severe hypertension increases the risk of rupturing the aneurysm.  
Tachycardia, severe hypertension, or hypotension should be avoided.  
**Optional rescue BP meds:**  
Neosynephrine infusion (connected) and diluted rescue syringe-common  
Nitroglycerine bottle and diluted rescue syringe- common or  
Cardene bag and diluted rescue syringe common or  
Nipride bag and diluted rescue syringe (rare)  
  
Infusion of low-dose vasopressors such as phenylephrine is often required.  
**Inotropes/pressors:** Epinephrine and Levophed should be readily available  
**  
Beta-blockers:**  
Esmolol  
Metoprolol  
Labetalol  
Beta-blockers are usually not administered until emergence.**  
Consider avoiding intraoperative beta-blockers.  
**Consider avoiding the administering of labetalol intraoperatively until the end of the procedure.  
In case of a hemorrhage and hypotension, raising the patient’s BP while the patient is beta blocked will be more challenging.  
  
**Aortic occlusion balloons:  
**Utilizing an aortic occlusion balloon is a technique of aortic clamping during EVAR in patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms and circulatory collapse.  
It is also briefly deployed with the insertion of the aortic stent-graft.  
The surgeon will inform you as it may result in hypertension.  
  
**Aortic occlusion balloon technique:  
**A balloon catheter is inserted percutaneously from the femoral artery and inflated in the suprarenal aorta.  
An introducer sheath must support the balloon.  
The stent graft is passed from the contralateral groin and deployed beneath the balloon.  
The sheath makes it possible to retrieve the balloon after the endograft has been deployed.  
Carbon dioxide facilitates angiography while the aortic blood flow is arrested.  
  
**Postoperative hypertension:  
**Many patients are started on a continuous Cardene infusion for postoperative hypertension.  
  
**Endoleak as a possible complication:  
**Endoleak is defined as persistent blood flow outside an endovascular graft but within the aneurysm sac.  
This can be immediate or delayed.  
  
**Incidence of endoleak:** Up to 18%, but the average incidence is 5–10%.  
  
**The types of endoleak are classified as follows:  
**Type I – At sites of graft attachment  
Type II – At sites of branches (i.e., back bleeding into the aneurysmal sac)  
Type III – Graft defect e.g. Hole in the graft  
Type IV – Graft wall porosityType I and II leaks can cause ongoing bleeding into the aneurysm leading to rupture.  
  
**Endoleaks can be managed by:**  
Conservative management with increased surveillance  
Coil embolization  
Placement of graft cuffs,  
Ligation of feeding collateral arteries  
Open repair  
Redo-EVAR  
  
**Post-implantation syndrome:**  
A possible complication post-EVAR.  
It is characterized by fever, raised plasma C-reactive protein, and white cell count in the absence of infection.  
It may last 2–10 days and responds to NSAIDs.  
  
**Local wound complications** : Include groin hematoma, infection, or lymphocele, and the incidence is 1 to 10%.  
  
**Access Artery Injury:** Arterial thrombosis, dissection, or pseudo-aneurysm formation can occur. Sometimes the large-catheter system of the stent graft (commonly between 20- and 24-French) is too large for a calcified iliofemoral vessel. In this case, the doctor may abort the EVAR or convert it to an iliac conduit.  
**  
IV Contrast Nephrology:  
**50 to 100mL of dye is needed for an EVAR procedure. According to a nationwide survey by Wald et al, contrast-induced nephropathy, resulting in acute renal failure, occurs in 6.7% of cases.  
**  
Ischemic complications immediately after EVAR:  
**Clot formation or clot embolization into the aortic side branches may lead to colonic, renal, and pelvic ischemia.  
Adversely, misplacement of the stent graft might occur, thereby partially or wholly covering an aortic or iliac side branch.  
This can result in renal or pelvic ischemia.  
  
**Bowel ischemia:**  
Occurs in 1 to 3% of all cases after an open aortic aneurysm repair, and the incidence seems to be the same with an EVAR.  
  
**Spinal Cord Ischemia:**  
Data suggests that this is very rare: < .21%.  
While this is not entirely understood, atheromatous embolization and interruption of collateral circulation from lumbar and internal iliac arteries, together with variable anatomy of the artery of Adamkiewicz, seem to be the most common contributing factors leading to cord ischemia.  
  
**Renal artery occlusion from stenting and retrieval of the stent graft:**  
Not correctly placing the stent may occlude one or both renal arteries.  
  
**Causes of both early and late limb occlusion after EVAR:**  
Limb kinking of the unsupported endograft limb.  
The second-generation supported stent grafts perform better than the older unsupported endograft.  
Most of the thrombotic events occur within the first two months after EVAR, and a majority of the underlying causes of limb thrombosis are stent-graft kinking.  
  
**Infection Complications after EVAR:**  
The incidence of aortic stent-graft infection is 0.5 to 1%, and untreated stent-graft infection can result in generalized sepsis and death.  
  
**Mortality and morbidity rates:  
Mortality of elective open AAA repair:** 5%  
  
**30-day mortality associated with ruptured AAA:**  
Believed to be around 80%  
Of those that reach the hospital alive and undergo emergency surgery, approximately 40% will die within 30 days of surgery.
