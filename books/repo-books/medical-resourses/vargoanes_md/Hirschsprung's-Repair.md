Hirschsprung’s Repair Anesthesia   

## Hirschsprung’s Repair Anesthesia

**_Edited by Anna Stone, CRNA_**

This repair is usually a 2-stage repair involving biopsies and a transitional colostomy, then later a Pull-through procedure and a colostomy closure in the same setting. Today, some of these procedures are now a one-time operation.

Anesthesia-wise, this case is usually just a laparoscopic–assisted Pull-through procedure. Some surgeons still use an open procedure involving a low transverse incision.

Pull-through procedure for Hirschsprung's is also known as Soave, Duhamel, Swenson Pullthrough.

**One Stage Procedure (combined)  
  
_The one-stage procedure is still not common due to the time lost waiting for Pathology (biopsy) results. The Pathology lab must be efficient and fully cooperative._  
**Transanal endorectal pull-through (TEPT) or Perineal One-Stage Pullthrough (POOP).  
Biopsies are first done laparoscopically. Once the pathologist has confirmed the presence and location of ganglion cells (functional colon) proximal to the aganglionic segment (nonfunctional colon), the colon dissection is started. Without going into specifics, the rectum and aganglionic colon is pulled down out through the anus until the ganglionated colon reaches the anus. The aganglionic colon is resected and the remaining ganglionic colon is re-anastomosed to the rectum. A transitional colostomy is not needed.  
The colon is actually pulled, extended, and exposed well outside of the rectum.

**Two Stage (older)**  
1st: Biopsies and a transition involving a colostomy for 4-6 weeks  
2nd: Definitive Pull-through (transanal anastomosis) and colostomy closure

**Pre-op  
**You need to find out more information about the case

Is it the first stage, second stage, or a combined procedure?  
You need to find out if the surgeon will prefer minimally invasive (laparoscopy) or open incision. For open incision (like any other belly procedure) consider:  
T & C with PRBCs available  
CBC and BMP we send H/H ASAP after obtaining second IV  
Does the patient have Trisomy 21?  
How much of the intestine's are affected by the disease?

The child's age, overall health, and medical history

**Anesthesia:** General/ETT  
**Caudal:** Is highly recommended, if able. Combine with Fentanyl but able to use smaller dosing. Depending on L/S ports may need Fentanyl, not just caudal. If surgery is greater than 4 hours, can repeat Caudal at ½-3/4 dose at end of surgery. Discuss options with parents. Ropivacaine 0.2% 1cc/kg for initial dose.  
**Duration:** 2-3 hours-1 stage  
**Position:** Transverse with the surgeon performing the laparoscopic portion of the procedure standing above the patient's head. Many surgeons move patients to end of the bed. Head and foot bed segment is taken off the bed to lessen the patient's distance for anesthesia. The baby usually has feet taped up, almost up to its head instead of stirrups.  
Older kids: stirrups, with the surgeon standing to the right side of the patient.  
**Airway:** Secure and make sure it is positioned to remain stable because  
you may not have quick access to it due to where the surgeon is positioned (field avoidance). It is also a good idea to put a foam doughnut over baby's face to protect from instruments.  
**IV Access:** 1-2. (2 good IVs for an open belly) We always use two IV's even if laparoscopic. Do not insert an IV in the foot if at all possible for it will end up in the surgeon's field.  
**NGT:** Yes, may already have one  
**Hydration:** 4:2:1  
Be aware that if the patient is an inpatient, most likely they have been on IV fluids and do not have a deficit to make up. We also like to run some type of Dextrose containing solution. Many times we use the fluids they had running on the floor and keep them at maintenance.

**(below is just a common reference)  
**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**Age range:** Usually newborn-18 months  
**Male: Female:** 4:1  
**Trisomy 21:** 5-15%-literature varies.

**Possible Complications  
**Partial or complete post op bowel obstruction (anastomotic stricture)  
Bowel infection  
Bowel perforation  
Prolonged ileus  
Pelvic or intraabdominal abscesses

**More Notes**  
**A one-stage procedure** is beneficial to neonates because the functional colon above the aganglionic section is less dilated, enterocolitis is less frequent. This makes the Pull-through easier for the surgeon. For a combined one- stage procedure, the Pathology Lab would have to be time efficient with all the biopsies sent by the surgeon. Time may be wasted waiting for pathology results. This is why only a few institutions combine the two stages today.
