### Epidural Test Dosing and Multi-Orifice Catheters

**Multi-orifice epidural catheters**  
Multi-orifice epidural catheters have three potential sites of exit for injected fluid or air, and the orifices may lie within two different body compartments.  
  
**If injected too slowly:** air or fluid preferentially exits the proximal orifices and not the tip (distal orifice).  
  
**A rapid injection is required for a distal exit of the catheter**  
The rapid injection used in clinical practice typically exceeds that required to ensure that fluid will exit all three orifices.  
  
The distal orifice is both the most difficult to test and the one most likely to be positioned outside the epidural space.The incidence of false negative aspiration is lower for multiorifice epidural catheters (<1%) compared to single-hole catheters (2%).
