### PEG Tube Placement: (Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy Tube)

A method of placing a tube into the stomach percutaneously; aided by endoscopy.

**Goal:** Be able to feed a patient adequate nutrition and lowering the incidence of aspiration. In order to rule out obstruction in the gastric outlet and duodenum, many GI docs confirm with a direct examination per EGD before the PEG tube is opened by the circulating RN.  
Using the EGD, the stomach is first insufflated to move it closer to the abdominal wall.  
Then in combination with a percutaneous needle, a guide wire and the view of the EGD, the PEG tube is safely inserted.

**Anesthesia:** General/ETT or Deep MAC with Propofol infusion.  
**Location:** In the OR and sometimes Endoscopy Lab.

**Duration:** 15-30 minutes  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
**Position:** Supine with arms out or to the side.  
**EBL:** Minimal

**Possible Complications**  
Perforated esophagus from the EGD  
Hemorrhage
