### Corneal Laceration Repair

A corneal laceration is a partial or full thickness injury to the cornea. A partial thickness injury does not violate the globe of the eye (abrasion). A full thickness injury penetrates completely through the cornea, causing a ruptured globe. The patient with a corneal laceration has experienced significant ocular trauma, typically from a metallic object. Injury can occur from trauma such as a hand or fingernail too. Additional pressure on the globe may result in extrusion of uveal tissue through the wound.  
**Anesthetic:** General/usually LMA.  
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 22G is acceptable. A 500mL NS bag with micro drip tubing is popular.  
**Position:** Supine with arms tucked and the patient remains on the same stretcher. Make sure the ETCO2 NC is looped away from the surgical eye. The stretcher is parked 90-180 degrees away from you (unless you are starting out as a general).
