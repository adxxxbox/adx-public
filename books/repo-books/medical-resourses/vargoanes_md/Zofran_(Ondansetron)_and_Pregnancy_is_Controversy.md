### Zofran (Ondansetron) and Pregnancy is Controversy

Listed as a Category B medication for pregnancy.  
  
**Pregnancy Category B:** Indicates that the medication has not been proven safe for use in pregnancy, but animal studies have not indicated toxicity.  
  
**Controversial reports of Zofran and birth defects:  
**Recent controversy suggests that exposure to Zofran in the first trimester for morning sickness is linked to congenital heart defects and orofacial malformations such as cleft palate in the neonate.  
  
Several international studies suggest that Zofran has teratogenic effects, while recent U.S. studies state that it may cause an increased risk of cleft palates.  
  
The Department of Clinical Pharmacology researchers at Copenhagen University documented that Zofran use during pregnancy increased the risk of cardiac birth defects.  
  
**From the Levin Simes Abrams website:** (National Personal Injury Lawyers)**Denmark Medical Birth registry results:**  
The Denmark Medical Birth registry identified 903,207 births from 1997 to 2010. In 1,368 of those births, the mother took Zofran during their first trimester.  
  
**Heart Defects:** 160% increase  
Atrial Septal Defects (ASD): 210% more likely  
Ventricular Septal Defects (VSD): 230% more likely  
Atrioventricular Septal Defects (AVSD): 480% more likely  
**From the legal website of Greenberg & Deberman, LLC  
(Zofran Birth Defect Lawsuit Lawyers)  
**Data supports that Zofran use is associated with a 30% increased risk of total birth defects and a double risk of heart defects.  
  
**According to DrugDangers.com by Seeger Weiss LLP:**  
Zofran was shown in a 2013 study to double the risk of a congenital heart defect.Multiple retrospective studies conducted in several countries, including the U.S. have shown that Zofran may increase the risk of other birth defects by as much as 34 percent.  
  
**Other potential birth defects caused by Zofran may include:**  
Kidney malformation  
Skeletal defects  
Fetal growth restriction  
Spontaneous abortion  
Stillbirth  
  
**According to a Journal** **of Medical Association (JAMA) article published in 2018:  
**First trimester exposure to Zofran was not associated with cardiac or congenital malformations in over one million offspring of mothers enrolled in Medicaid.  
However, Zofran was associated with a small increased risk of oral clefts.  
  
**According to a 2018 article by Obstetrics & Gynecology:**  
There is only a modest association with cleft palate and renal agenesis-dysgenesis, however further investigation is warranted.  
  
According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), there is not enough evidence to support that Zofran is teratogenic.
