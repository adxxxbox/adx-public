| Insufficient data  
48 hours if clotting studies and fibrinogen are normal.  
  
(2 day minimum is based on prolonged plasminogen  
depression for 27 hours.  
  
Note: Fibrinogen is one the last  
clotting factors to recover)  
  
Treatment for depletion of fibrinogen with a major bleed:  
Administer cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate. | No | Insufficient data.  
Not until fibrinogen  
level has recovered. | Insufficient data.  
Not until fibrinogen  
level has recovered. |

  
**Deep plexus and peripheral blocks:** Same recommendations as neuraxial.**Superficial peripheral blocks:** Based on vascularity, site compressibility and available management if bleeding occurred.
