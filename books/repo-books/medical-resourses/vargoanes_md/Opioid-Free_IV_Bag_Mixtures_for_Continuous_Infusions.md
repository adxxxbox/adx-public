### Opioid-Free Agent Combinations for Continuous Infusion (intraoperative)

The following opioid-free mixtures have been published and used off-label by clinicians.**Lidocaine-Ketamine Infusion:** (based on ideal body weight)\- A lidocaine bolus of 1.5 mg/kg within 10 minutes preoperatively- diluted in 100 mL of saline.  
\- Then, continuously infuse lidocaine intraoperatively at 3 mg/kg/hour.  
\- A bolus dose of ketamine of 0.35 mg/kg should be 10 minutes preoperatively diluted in 100 mL of saline.  
\- Followingly, continuously infuse ketamine intraoperatively at 0.2 mg/kg/hour (diluted in a 60 mL saline) and at a rate of 20 mL/hour.  
A 60 mL syringe can be used with a syringe pump.  
**Lidocaine-Magnesium Infusion:** (based on ideal body weight)1.5 mg/kg bolus of lidocaine (diluted in 100 mL bag of saline) within 10 minutes preoperatively.  
Then continuously infuse 3 mg/kg/hour of lidocaine intraoperatively.  
A 50 mg/kg slow bolus dose of magnesium (diluted in 100 mL of saline) within 10 minutes preoperatively.  
Followingly by 10 mg/kg/hour of magnesium intraoperatively (diluted in 60 mL of saline) infused at a rate of 20 mL/h.  
A 60 mL syringe can be used with a syringe pump.**Lidocaine-Ketamine-Magnesium-Precedex Cocktail:  
(mixed in one IV bag)  
Infuse at 0.5 mL/kg/hour** (based on ideal body weight)Turn off the infusion when the surgical closure (suturing) is initiated.  
**Mixture:**  
Remove 20 mLs from a 100 mL bag of saline.  
  
**Then inject the following into the same IV bag of saline:**  
Inject 20 mL of 2% lidocaine  
60 mg of ketamine  
2 grams of magnesium  
80 mcg of precedex  
  
**The same mixture as above using a 60 mL syringe with a syringe pump:  
Also, infuse at 0.5 mL/kg/hour** (based on ideal body weight)10 mLs of 2% lidocaine  
30 mg of ketamine  
40 mcg of precedex  
1 gram of magnesium  
Aspirate IV fluid to get a total of 50 mLs in the syringe (LR or saline)
