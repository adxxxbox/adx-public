# Granulocytes

Granulocytes, also called neutrophils, are sometimes given to immunosuppressed patients to help fight off bacterial or fungal infections.  
Neutropenia is one of the most frequent side effects of these aggressive treatments and the risk of infection increases rapidly when the granulocyte count falls below 500 cells/micro.  
Many cancer patients receive granulocytes when they don't respond to other meds.  
Most often granulocytes are given daily for 5 days or until the patient's granulocyte count returns to a level which allows the patient to fight the infection on his own. Granulocytes are usually infused into a vein over 1-2 hours.  
Current guidelines recommend transfusion of granulocytes as soon as possible after collection.  
If unavoidable, storage should be limited to 24 hours at 22°C +/- 2°C.  
Granulocytes are transfused daily until the patient's infection clears or until the neutrophil count exceeds 500/ul. A red cell crossmatch must be performed with each concentrate.  
over 1-2 hours.
