Bladder Procedure-Why Muscle Relaxation May Be Needed     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Bladder Procedure and Obturator Nerve

The Obturator nerve passes in close proximity to the inferolateral bladder wall, bladder neck and lateral prostatic urethra.  
  
During a bladder or transurethral operation, resection in these areas may result in stimulation of the Obturator nerve, causing violent adductor contraction and possible inadvertent bladder perforation. This is NOT because your patient was light!  
  
This is why many surgeons demand muscle relaxation or a spinal for many simple bladder procedures that otherwise look like they would just require an LMA.  
  
Stimulation of the obturator nerve may sometimes be seen when inserting the cystoscope when entering the bladder.
