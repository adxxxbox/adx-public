### Pancreatic Transplant

Most pancreas transplants are performed with kidney transplantation. Almost all pancreas transplants are done to treat cases of type 1 DM and are typically reserved for those who have serious diabetes complications.   
**3 main categories of pancreas transplantation:**  
1\. SPK- simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation. 75% of all cases.  
2\. PAK- pancreas after kidney -15% of cases.  
3\. PAT-pancreas alone transplantation -10% of cases.

**Pre-op:**

Dialysis, if indicated, is done within 24 hours of the operation. All the cardiac medications should be given preoperatively. Glucose/insulin sliding scale is started before surgery.

Sometimes an infusion of a D10 solution at 40mL/h and a sliding scale regimen is given, appropriately tailored to the patient.

Consider aspiration prophylaxis, Reglan and Zantac or Pepcid is common. Patients with very high aspiration risks may also get 20-30mLs of Bicitra. Oral hypoglycemic agents should be held on the morning of the surgery.  
  
**Labs:** CBC, platelet count, electrolytes especially K+, serum glucose, BUN, serum creatinine, PT, PTT, INR, liver function tests, urinalysis, ECG, CXR and an Echocardiogram are done. Evaluation of cardiac function is of central importance because CAD is common with ESRD and DM.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT/ Epidural.  
Epidural analgesia could, in theory, be used as the sole anesthetic. Be careful with epidurals because hypovolemia could be worsened by concomitant vasodilatation secondary to the epidural analgesia.  
  
**Position:** Supine with a lateral tilt at various stages throughout the operation. Care must be given to any fistula site (or possible future fistula sites) by avoiding the insertion of large cannulas into these veins.  
**Spinal:** NO, the case is too long.  
**Duration:** 5-8 hours  
**EBL:** 300-600 mLs.  
**IV Access:** Always a central line. The surgeon will want you to monitor CVP and the patient is started on TPN post operatively. A central line is needed for TPN infusion.  
**Recommended CVP:** 10-15mmHg and normovolemia. When clamps on the iliac vessels are released, it is useful to have a CVP of 15–17mm Hg as the reperfusion of the lower limb (especially in SPK) often brings about a drop in systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure, which may compromise the grafts.   
**A-Line:** Yes, there is potential for rapid swings in BP and acid–base balance that often needs managing (acidosis is common).

**IV Fluids:** Crystalloids over colloids, because the colloids may worsen graft edema after surgery.  
**RSI:** Yes, having DM and/or uremia, these patients are prone to gastroesophageal reflux and gastroparesis.  
**Muscle Relaxants:** Atracurium or Cisatracurium is the usual choice for renal transplantation due to Hoffmann degradation but Vecuronium and Rocuronium can also be used safely.

**Anectine** is Ok if the K+ <  5.5 mEq/L. Plasma cholinesterase has been reported to be below normal in more than 20% of ESRD patients whether they are receiving any form of dialysis or not.  
**Anti-rejection drug:** Yes, **Basiliximab:** 20 mg is usually given at induction.

**Inhalation Agent:** Isoflurane is recommended. The risk of nephrotoxicity is remote. Isoflurane also has minimal effects on cerebral blood flow at 1 MAC and beneficial effects on renal blood flow.  
**Desflurane** is resistant to biodegradation and so even a prolonged exposure to Desflurane (7.0 MAC hours) has been associated with normal renal function.  
**Sevoflurane** undergoes biodegradation to inorganic fluoride. A serum fluoride concentration of 50micro-moles/l is the peak value that is nephrotoxic. There is also evidence of transient impairment of renal concentrating ability and renal tubular injury.   
**Foley:** Yes, UO often cannot be measured until after surgery, and many patients are anuric preoperatively. Perioperative fluid management is guided by hourly urine output, CVP and clinical judgments.  
**NG Tube:** Yes.  
**Insulin Drip:** Is common.  
**Check blood sugar:** Yes, and at the time of pancreatic anastomosis, check every 15 minutes. Stop the insulin drip because profound hypoglycemia can occur at this point.   
Consider a dextrose infusion. Have a 500 cc bag up and ready to infuse at this point.  
**Steroids:** Methylprednisolone 1g is commonly given intra-operatively.  
**Antibiotics:** A broad spectrum antibiotic is also routine (repeated after 6 h), or if penicillin allergic, Vancomycin is administered.  
**Inotropic and vasopressor drips:** Have available.  
**Neosynephrine:** Is supposed to be avoided for all organ transplants.  
**Mannitol and Lasix:** Yes, if it’s a SPK. The surgeons will promote a diuresis; Mannitol is also a free radical scavenger.  
**NSAIDS:** NO: because there is a risk of renal impairment in a newly grafted kidney. Toradol may also increase GI surgical bleeding.

**Ketamine:** Pharmacokinetics of ketamine are not significantly changed by renal disease.     
**Type and Cross:** Yes, blood should be available.  
**Ventilation:** Tidal volume of 8–10 ml/kg is recommended with low Peep.  

**Procedure:**  
Usually, the patient’s native kidneys and pancreas are not removed.  
For SPK, a midline incision is made above the umbilicus. It is an intra-peritoneal procedure and right-sided iliac vessels are mobilized. The portal vein is anastomosed to the external iliac vein and the donor end of the common iliac artery is sutured to the recipient common iliac artery.  
In the case of SPK, the kidney is placed in the left iliac fossa. The preferred method of duct drainage is now the enteral route. The duodenum is anastomosed to the recipient's ileum.   
  
**Coagulation Issues:**

Accumulation of endogenous toxic products like guanininosuccinate, phenol and phenolic acids leads to platelet dysfunction and decreased levels of platelet factor III. PT and PTT remain normal but bleeding time is prolonged. Treatment includes platelet transfusion, cryoprecipitate, desmopressin acetate or conjugated estrogen.

**Emergence:**

**Anticholinesterase Drugs- Reversal**  
Renal excretion accounts for approximately 50% of the clearance of neostigmine and approximately 75% of elimination of edrophonium and pyridostigmine. Renal failure allows some protection against residual neuromuscular blockade because renal elimination half times of anticholinesterase drugs are prolonged.  
**Recovery Room:** 

Regular monitoring of arterial gases, hemoglobin, serum electrolytes, amylase and clotting is important; these can change rapidly over the first 72 hours after surgery.  
CXR to check line placement. TPN and LMW Heparin (thromboprophylaxis) is usually started.  
  
**Possible Complications:**  
Hemorrhage  
Low UO.  
Electrolyte abnormalities.  
Femoral neuropathy.  
  
**Other Notes:**  
For SPK, patients must have a nephropathy with a creatinine clearance of <40 ml min−1, be on dialysis or very near to needing it.

Bench preparation (up to 2 h) of the pancreas allograft is necessary; this includes removal of the spleen, mobilization of the portal vein and restoration of the arterial vascular anatomy, using the donor iliac vessels and forming a Y-shaped graft.

Studies show that good function of the new pancreas may help slow the progression of other problems related to diabetes, such as nerve and eye damage, and decrease the chance that diabetic changes may occur in the transplanted kidney.

In many cases, both transplanted organs may come from the one deceased donor. However, it is also possible for the kidney to come from a living donor (a family member or friend) and the pancreas from a deceased donor.

With an SKP transplant, it treats both kidney failure and diabetes, because the new organs replace the function of the failed kidney and the pancreas. 

People with type 2 DM are not candidates for SKP. In type 2 DM, the pancreas makes insulin, but the patient's body tissues are not able to use this insulin properly. For this reason, a pancreas transplant would not help to correct type 2 DM. However, people with this type of diabetes can still have a kidney transplant if they develop kidney failure because of their diabetes.

Dialysis if indicated is done within 24 hours of the operation. Overzealous ultrafiltration is best avoided. Volume status is roughly estimated by their dry weight. Loss of more than 2g during dialysis suggests significant intravascular depletion

Induction of an immunosupression treatment is started before the patient enters the operating room.
