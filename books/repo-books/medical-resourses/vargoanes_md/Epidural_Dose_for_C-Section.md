Epidural Dose for C-Section    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Epidural Dose for C-Section

There are many combinations of agents used by anesthesia providers, comprising mixtures of local anesthetics with opioids.  
  
**Most common doses for an epidural to C-section  
**Average dose is usually 15-20 mL of 2% plain Lidocaine (no Epi) and a narcotic.2 mL of Fentanyl or 2-4 mg of preservative-free Morphine is commonly administered just prior to administering the Lidocaine via separate syringe.  
Fentanyl is much more popular than Morphine due to its fast onset, but some providers prefer morphine and swear by it. Morphine is not conventionally given per epidural until the baby is delivered.  
  
_Some literature will tell you the 2% lidocaine range is 20-30 mLs and I have NEVER seen that much administered._ If your patient with the epidural has any kind of pre-set block for labor, you should only need 10-15 mLs and dose in 5mL increments. If the patient becomes uncomfortable throughout the procedure, you can always administer 5 mLs more as needed.  
We usually start dosing the patient in their rooms before being transported to the OR. Many may find this practice questionable if patient is not adequately monitored.  
  
Most patients will develop an adequate level with 15-20 ml of 2% Lidocaine.  
It just depends on what your patient’s base level was from their previous continuous fusion.  
  
**Two most common Local Anesthetic for C-Sections**  
15-20 ml of 3% Chloroprocaine over 10 minutes in increments of 5 mLs._  
**Note** : The volume dose of 2% Lidocaine is similar to that of 2% or 3% Chloroprocaine.  
Some literature states 30 mLs of 3% Chloroprocaine per textbook dose is recommended for C-sections. This appears very rare for a C-section.  
  
_**What is your patient’s previous block level from their continuous epidural infusion?  
**Your patient who has been on a continuous epidural infusion for labor around 12mLs/hr should at least have a sensory block at or near T10 (umbilicus).It is rare to obtain adequate surgical anesthesia for a C-section with only a T10 level.  
For C-sections, we want to achieve a T4 (nipple level) block.  
To advance a block from T10 up to T4 usually takes 10-20 mLs of 2% Lidocaine.  
  
**What if your patient already has an excellent T10 base level from their epidural infusion?  
**Sometimes we can achieve a T4 level with only 10 mLs of Lidocaine.  
You may need still need to administer 5 mLs more as the surgery proceeds if the level wears down.  
  
**When should I administer a 5mL bolus of Lidocaine during the C-section?  
**When you notice your patient is feeling more uncomfortable with pressure.  
A slow surgeon or 40 minutes into the C-section.  
Patient starts to feel pain. Procedure prolonged by scarring. e.g from prior surgery or by a tubal sterilization  
  
Re-dosing the epidural with 5 mLs of 2% lidocaine takes approximately 5 minutes to take affect so dosing should not be delayed.  
  
**Urgent C-Section**  
Draw up 30cc syringe of 3% Nesacaine (chloroprocaine) or 2% Lidocaine.  
Start administering 5mL-10mL increments while still in the patient’s labor room and closely assess the sensory-motor level while transporting to the OR.  
_Be prepared for a STAT general anesthetic if level is inadequate._  
  
**Adding 3mls of NaHCO3 to 30mLs of local Anesthetic** Some literature states you should administer 3 mLs of NaHCO3 to decrease the onset (make the onset quicker). Most people I have consulted with say it is too inconvenient to locate and draw up the NaHCO 3 just to save 1-2 minutes.  
_NOTE: Bupivacaine is also subject to precipitate formation with NaHCO3._  
  
**More Notes  
**When you hear your epidural patient will be converting from a vaginal delivery to a C-section, ensure that she receives famotidine and metoclopramide IV and Bicitra PO.  
**_NOTE: Metoclopramide may unmask prolactin-induced tachycardia (dopamine is in the negative feedback loop for prolactin secretion. It seems to be falling into disuse._**  
Presumptively full stomach indicates full aspiration precautions.  
  
IV fluids should be wide open in order to decrease hypotension while you dose the Labor Epidural to achieve a T4 level.  
**Literature recommends two local anesthetics with epidural dosing for a C-section:  
A)** Chloroprocaine (Nesacaine) comes in two popular concentrations, 2% and 3%. The onset is around 10 minutes in both concentrations, however, the 3% provides a denser sensory block.  
**B)** 2% Lidocaine 15 minute onset  
Most anesthesia providers use 2% Lidocaine.**  
  
Literature states to add Epinephrine**  
Some literature states that you should add 1:200,000 Epi to Lidocaine or Chloroprocaine.  
Most of the anesthesia providers I work with or consult use plain Lidocaine and their C-section patients do well.  
One article I read stated that plain Lidocaine is much less effective than Lidocaine with epinephrine.” This may be true, but it is not needed. However, some anesthesia still add Epi to their Lidocaine and swear by it.  
  
In summation, it is a provider preference whether or not to add 1:200k Epi to the local anesthetic. Either way, if you have a functioning epidural, your patient will do great with an adequately dosed epidural.  
  
**The addition of narcotics per epidural POST-delivery  
**_Remember the more you give, the higher the incidence of side effects (itching)._  
3mg of PF Morphine (Duramorph) is usually sufficient.  
Do not forget to flush a couple mLs of PF saline to flush the Duramorph out of the epidural catheter and into the patient.  
  
Duramorph is usually administered post-delivery (before the epidural catheter is pulled out- before leaving the operating room. This is for post-operative analgesia, which may last up to 24 hours (literature varies).  
  
**Addition of Fentanyl with the local anesthetic  
**Some literature talks about adding 50-100mcg of Fentanyl to improve intraoperative anesthesia and decreases intraoperative nausea and shivering. Low dose narcotics do not affect the fetus.  
  
Many anesthesia providers add 100mcg of Fentanyl to their epidural dosing because it is synergistic and provides increased pain relief when they exteriorize the uterus and does not impact the fetus. Many CRNAs administer 2-5 mg of Duramorph, however, most do not until the baby is delivered.  
  
_Always remember that cocktails vary, especially with narcotics_  
  
**Ask the reason for the C-section**  
Prolonged bradycardia? Late decelerations? Failure to progress?  
Category 2 or 3 FHT?
