Intussusception Review   

## Intussusception Review

Intussusception is a life-threatening illness and occurs when a more proximal portion of bowel invaginates back into the more distal bowel. Like a retracting telescope or lowering an IV pole.

This often causes colonic venous congestion, edema, and bowel obstruction which may cut off the blood supply to the affected bowel. Ultimately resulting in ischemia and death to the affected bowel with subsequent perforation, peritonitis and death.

The most common site is the ileocecal junction.  
**Possible Causative Associations:**  
Meckel’s diverticulum.

Intestinal polyp.  
Lymphoma  
Adhesions  
Hemolytic  
Uremic syndrome.  
Ectopic pancreatic nodule.  
Henoch’s purpura.

**The early symptoms of intussusception coincide with a bowel obstruction: They include**  
Abdominal pain  
Bloody diarrhea (red currant jelly stool)  
Late stage vomiting and dehydration

**Intussusception Facts**  
**Gender:** Greater in males : females by ratio of 3:2.  
**Average age** : 3 months-six years. Rarely occurs in adults.  
61% of cases are before age 1.  
Only 10% to 25% of cases occur after age 2.  
90% of pediatric intussusceptions are ileocolic and idiopathic.  
  

**Initial Treatment  
**Radiologic reduction by either barium or air enema: success rates here can be as high as 84%.  
An Abdominal X-ray may confirm bowel obstruction and suggest perforation (but an absence of air under the diaphragm does not exclude it).
