Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (PCC) (4F-PCC) (Kcentra, Octaplex)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Kcentra (Prothrombin Complex Concentrate) (PCC,4F-PCC) (Octaplex)

_American Society of Hematology's Choosing Wisely®_ _initiative for 2014 warns against overuse of PCCs in the absence of clinical bleeding.  
  
Do not confuse PCC with” aPCC (FEIBA).” aPCC is “Activated.”_  
  
**Common dose for bleeding:** 30 units/kg (single dose) Slow push  
May repeat in 4 hours.  
Ordered by the surgeon  
Pharmacy prepares it.  
  
Single-dose Kcentra 4F-PCC–the only FDA-approved alternative to plasma for urgent warfarin reversal.  
  
Considered first line treatment in patients with major bleeding on VKAs.  
  
Kcentra, a 4F-PCC containing coagulation Factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as antithrombotic Proteins C and S, is designed to selectively restore the pro-coagulant and antithrombotic protein deficiencies induced by VKAs (vitamin K antagonist–warfarin).  
It does NOT contain activated bypass inhibiting properties like FEIBA.  
  
“Kcentra” was the first “NON-activated PCC.”  
Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (PCC) is considered a 2nd option behind FEIBA (aPCC) for life threatening bleeds.  
  
Most PCCs contain 500-600 IU of Factor IX (FIX) per vial.  
  
**Indications:**  
Urgent reversal for patients with severe bleeding caused by anticoagulation with Vitamin K Antagonists (VKAs).  
Treatment and prevention of bleeding in hemophilia B patients if pure factor IX is not available.  
  
**Note:** Vitamin K antidote onset is very slow.  
  
**Possible option for eminent life-threatening bleeding due to:**  
Rivaroxaban  
Apixaban  
Edoxaban  
Dabigatran  
_However, PCCs do NOT directly neutralize the activity of new oral anticoagulants._  
  
**Onset:** 5-15 minutes- INR reverses within minutes (15–20 minutes), while it may take FFP 6 to 24 hours.  
**Note:** Vitamin K antidote onset is very slow.  
**Duration of effect:** 12- 24 hours used with Vitamin K.  
  
**Contraindications:**  
PCCs contain heparin and may not be an option in patients who are sensitive to heparin or have a recent diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.  
  
Patients with known anaphylactic or severe systemic reactions to Kcentra or any of its components (including heparin, Factors II, VII, IX, X, Proteins C and S, Antithrombin III and human albumin).  
Patients with DIC.  
  
**More Notes:**  
**PCCs versus FFP**  
Several studies that PCC use in VKA-associated intracranial hemorrhage leads to faster INR reversal, less hematoma expansion, and similar or better mortality rates and functional outcomes compared to FFP.  
Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (PCC) is considered a 2nd option behind FEIBA (aPCC) for life threatening bleeds.  
“Kcentra” was the first non-activated PCC.  
Most PCCs contain 500-600 IU of FIX per vial.  
  
**PCC (Kcentra, 4F-PCC) vs aPCC (FEIBA)  
**PCC (Kcentra, 4F-PCC) contains heparin–avoid with heparin sensitive patients.  
aPCC (FEIBA) more concentrated with Factors  
aPCC(FEIBA) contains activated forms of factors II, IX and X as well as activated factor VII.  
aPCC (FEIBA) can be used for “Factor VIII Inhibitor Patients.”  
PCC (Kcentra, 4F-PCC) is still highly recommended in current guidelines.  
  
**Quick Notes and Facts**  
Very little literature and protocols found with PCC–as well as the other reversal products.  
25 times more concentrated than fresh frozen plasma (FFP).  
Not as concentrated with clotting factors as aPCC (FEIBA).  
Replaces coagulation factors lowered by warfarin.  
It is made from human plasma.  
A version that is made by recombinant methods which only contains factor IX is also available.  
A number of different formulations are now available globally.  
Rebound of anticoagulant effect after “reversal” ~12 to 24 hr.  
PCCs are available by IV immediately versus delay needed with FFP.  
The risk of volume overload and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) associated with FFP is not seen with PCCs.  
  
**Disadvantages of PCCs vs FFP  
**Pro-thrombotic risk.
