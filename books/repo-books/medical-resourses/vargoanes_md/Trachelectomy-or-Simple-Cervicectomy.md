### Trachelectomy or Simple Cervicectomy

The surgical removal of the cervix.  This can be done vaginally: Vaginal Trachelectomy.   
   
**Radical Trachelectomy or a radical vaginal trachelectomy also known as RVT; or the Dargent operation.**  
Removal of the cervix, parametrium, vaginal cuff and nearby lymph nodes.  
The uterus is then attached to the vagina.  
 

This can also be performed vaginally or laparoscopic with sentinel lymph-node biopsies to further reduce the duration, extent, and complications of surgery. This procedure is a fertility-preserving procedure that has recently gained worldwide acceptance as a method of surgically treating small invasive cancers of the cervix. If the woman later becomes pregnant, she will require a cervical cerclage to carry the pregnancy and later a C-section.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
**Laparoscopic:** Becoming more popular for pelvic lymphadenectomy.  
**Duration:** 1-3 hours. Depends on the surgeon and if it’s a radical procedure.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
**EBL:** 20-50mLs  
 

**Indications**: Early stages of cervical cancer in young fertile women.

**Possible Complications**  
Bleeding  
Infection  
Lymphedema  
Numbness in the thighs
