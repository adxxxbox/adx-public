### Biventricular AICD/Pacer Insertion

Also called Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT).  
  
These patients are usually in heart failure with a VERY low EF. It seems to me that most of these patients have an EF <20%. CRT improves symptoms of heart failure in about 50% of patients who have been treated maximally with medications, but still have severe or moderately severe heart failure symptoms.

CRT can improve a patient’s EF by 5% to 10%. In some cases, patients with a CRT device develop normal ventricular function. It is not rare for a patient to increase his or her EF up to or over 40%.

This pacemaker synchronizes the ventricle’s contractions on the heart’s right and left sides to prevent life-threatening arrhythmias. This device has 2 or 3 leads that are positioned in the:  
Right atrium  
Right ventricle  
Left ventricle (via the coronary sinus vein)

The leads are usually guided through the left subclavian to reach the heart. The first two leads are guided to the heart’s right atrium and right ventricle. The lead tips are attached to the heart muscle. The other ends of the leads are attached to the pulse generator, which is placed under the skin into a surgically made pocket in the upper chest. The third lead, a left ventricular lead, is guided to the coronary sinus (a small vein on the back of the heart) to pace the left ventricle. This is the most difficult part of the case and it increases the case duration significantly. This is all done under fluoroscopy.

**Ask the EP Nurse:** Yes, the EP nurses are very informative and can save you time since they know the routine better than we do.  
  
**Anesthesia:** MAC or General. Depends on the facility and patient. Most are MAC cases. PEC I block is an option to decrease the level of needed sedation.

If it is a MAC, you need to deepen the patient prior to the initial local injection, and at the end of the procedure when V-Tach or V-Fib is induced for the defibrillation test.  
  
**Induction agent:** Etomidate is preferred over Propofol to deepen the patient.  
  
**Precedex Drip:** I have seen many CRNAs use Precedex successfully throughout the case at an infusion rate of 0.4mcg/kg/hr.  
**Precedex maintenance range**: 0.2-0.7mcg/kg/hr.  
**Duration:** 2-4 hours  
**Fluids:** Monitor closely, avoid fluid overload.  
**IV Access:** Two 20g lines are acceptable.  
**A-line:** Yes, EP Cardiologists wants to visualize any change in BP immediately.  
**Induction agent:** Etomidate.  
**Diluted Ephedrine and Epi:** Yes, have some syringes available. Ephedrine and Epi are preferred over Neosynephrine in a patient with a poor EF when patient crashes.  
**Foley:** Usually.  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**Neosynephrine Drip**: Yes  
**Possible Complication**  
Cardiac Arrest with failure to convert.  
**More Notes:**  
The Bi-V implant technique is technically challenging and is unsuccessful about 10% of the time due to an unfavorable location of the patient's coronary sinus vein.

Traditional pacemakers are used to treat slow heart rhythms. Pacemakers regulate the right atrium and right ventricle to maintain a good heart rate and keep the atrium and ventricle working together. This is called AV synchrony. Biventricular pacemakers add a third lead to help the left ventricle contract at the same time as the right ventricle.
