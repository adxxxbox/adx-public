### Cloacal Malformation Repair and Anesthesia

**Procedure: Posterior Sagittal Anorectovaginourethoplasty**  
_Edited by Lauren Freedman, CRNA St Petersburg, FL_

Anorectovaginourethoplasty is the simultaneous and comprehensive repair of urethra, vagina and rectum, bringing each to a separate opening on the perineum

The surgical repair depends on the length of the common channel and what anatomically is involved.  
Concerning anesthesia, it is usually a long simple case requiring muscle relaxation.

Initially, the goals are to identify associated abnormalities, to provide drainage of the urinary tract and to divert the bowel using a colostomy.  
All of these patients required a colostomy, revision before the main repair.

**Anorectovaginourethoplasty**  
The vagina is separated from the urinary tract - this may require a laparotomy if the common channel is longer than 3cm. The rectum is then separated from the vagina. Finally, the urethra is reconstructed using the old common channel.  
The vagina is sutured to the perineum, and the rectum is attached to the posterior sphincteric mechanism.  
Odd tissue arrangements may necessitate the use of bowel or skin flaps to refashion the area.

This procedure may be done through a midline incision in the perineum if the confluence is relatively close to the surface or may require both abdominal and perineum approaches for a high confluence.

_The length of the common channel is an important determinant of the potential for urinary control, and predicts the extent of surgical repair._

**Common channel <3cm**  
Repair in patients with a common channel shorter than 3cm is reproducible and feasible for most pediatric surgeons. A posterior sagittal approach can be used to repair the defect without an abdominal approach. First, the rectum is mobilized. The vagina and urinary tract are then mobilized together (total urogenital mobilization), with the goal that both of these structures reach the perineum.

**Common channel >3cm** In patients with a common channel longer than 3 cm, the surgical repair is more extensive and may need to be fully repaired in stages. Total urogenital mobilization may be extremely difficult. The vagina and urethra may need to be separated, which is a lengthy procedure. Also, a pull-through of the rectum may need to be performed. If a pull-through procedure is done, ask the surgeon about relaxation since a nerve stimulator may be used.

50% of these patients have various degrees of vaginal or uterine septation. These can be totally or partially repaired during the main operation.

**Pre-op You need to simply find out from the surgeon the following:** What is he/she going to do? Position Duration

**Anesthetic: General/ETT  
Airway issues: usually none  
Regional:** Caudal catheters work great.

**Induction:** Standard, but RSI if an imperforate anus is involved.**Nitrous:** Optional**Muscle Relaxation:** Usually**Position** : Almost always supine  
Age: > 6 months  
**Duration:** 3-7 hours  
**EBL:** Minimal, we do type and screen.**Blood Bolus dose:** 10-20cc/kg if needed.  
**IV Access:** 1 good large port needed. 1, is good 2 is preferable

**Hydration: 4:2:1** **(below is just a common reference)**  
Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin - more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**A-line:** Usually not needed**Foley Catheter:** Yes, if there is a patent bladder.  
If not, check on hydration status, talk with the surgeon they can help assess urine output by what's in the field.  
Watch your pulse ox waveform, HR and BP and follow a fluid plan closely  
**Emergence:** Standard**  
  
Possible Complications:**  
Vaginal stricture or atresia  
Urethral strictures  
Urethro-vaginal fistula  
Fecally incontinent  
Urinary tract infections  
Pyocolpos  
Vaginal perforation  
Persistent urogenital sinus  
Colostomy prolapse: The colostomy created may be too distally, and may interfered with the pull-through.
