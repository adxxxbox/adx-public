### Cerebral Aneurysms: Facts

**Cerebral Aneurysms**  
Incidence is 2,000 per 100,000 (1 in 50)  
Average incidence of rupture is 12 per 100,000 (1 in 8,000)  
No single pathologic mechanism exists for etiology.  
  
**Cerebral Aneurysms May result from:**  
Arteriosclerosis  
Congenital abnormality  
Trauma  
Inflammation/infection

**Predisposing factors**  
Hypertension  
Increased age  
Increased risk in smokers compared to nonsmokers.  
Increased risk for African Americans compared to Caucasians.

**Cerebral Aneurysms Size and Shapes**  
Small aneurysms: diameter of less than 15mm.  
Larger aneurysms: 15 - 25mm.  
Giant: 25 to 50mm.  
Super giant: > 50 mm.  
Berry aneurysm: is the most common shape.  
Saccular aneurysm is a sack or saccular outpouching.  
Fusiform aneurysm is an aneurysm without a stem.

The vast majority of aneurysms (80–90%) are located in the anterior (carotid) circulation, the anterior and posterior communicating, and the middle cerebral artery. The remaining 10–20% are located in the posterior (vertebrobasilar) circulation.
