### Dermatomes - Why Sensory Levels Need to Be Higher than Surgical Level

**_Why are the levels for surgery higher than the area of incision and operation?  
_****_Daniel D. Moos CRNA_**When reviewing the required sensory levels, it seems odd that the sensory level is higher than where the surgical procedure actually takes place. For example, why is the level for lower extremity surgery with a tourniquet four levels higher than a surgical procedure without a tourniquet? Especially when the dermatome map indicates that sensation from the hip down entails the dermatome levels of L1-S1! The answer lies in the function of the afferent autonomic nerves. Afferent autonomic nerves innervate visceral sensations and viscerosomatic reflexes at the spinal level.  
  
Afferent autonomic nerves are the reason.Innervations for visceral sensations and viserosomatic reflexes occur at spinal segments that are much higher than the skin dermatome level of the proposed surgical procedure.
