### Re-Expand the Lungs then Turn Ventilator On

Re-expand the lung at the surgeon’s request. Use a manual inspired hold with pressure less than 20cm. At the surgeon’s request, resume mechanical controlled ventilation. Avoid high inspiratory pressures and large tidal volumes because the LIMA graft may be disrupted by repetitively being displaced by the hyperexpanded lungs.
