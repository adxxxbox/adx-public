### Interscalene Nerve Block with Nerve Stimulator Notes

Utilizing a nerve stimulator is now less common when performing interscalene nerve blocks when using live ultrasound guidance.  
  
Stimulation of the brachial plexus with a higher stimulating current (e.g., >1.0 mA) results in an exaggerated response and unnecessary discomfort for the patient.  
  
The unpredictably strong response often causes dislodgment of the needle and a withdrawal reaction by the patient.  
Local anesthetic should not be injected when a motor response is obtained at a current intensity <0.2 mA because this is associated with intraneural needle placement.  
Avoid attributing to diaphragmatic and trapezius twitches to stimulation of the brachial plexus.  
Misinterpretation of these twitches is one of the most common causes of block failure.  
When in doubt, palpate the muscle that appears to be twitching to ensure the proper response.

| Observed response | Interpretation | Problem | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Local neck muscle twitches | Direct stimulation of the anterior scalene or  
the sternocleidomastoid muscle | Needle pass in the wrong plane | Withdrawal the needle to the skin level,  
reinsert the needle anteriorly and posteriorly |
| Needle contacts bone at  
1-2 cm depth (no twitches) | Needle stopped by transverse  
process or the first rib | Needle is too posterior and contacting  
the anterior tubercles of the transverse process | Withdrawal the needle and reinsert it  
15 degrees anteriorly |
| Diaphragmatic twitching | Phrenic nerve stimulation | Needle is too anterior | Reinsert the needle  
15 degrees posteriorly |
| Arterial blood in the tubing | Carotid artery puncture  
(most common) | Needle insertion and angle too anterior | Withdrawal the needle and apply pressure.  
Reinsert the needle 1-2 cm posteriorly |
| Pectoralis muscle twitch | Brachia plexus stimulation  
(C4-C5) | None | Inject local anesthetic |
| Twitching of the scapula | Twitch of the anterior serratus muscle and  
stimulation of thoracodorsal nerves | Needle is too posterior and  
deep into the brachial plexus | Withdrawal the needle and reinsert it anteriorly |
| Trapezius muscle twitches | Accessary nerve stimulation | Needle is posterior to the brachial plexus | Withdrawal the needle and  
reinsert it anteriorly |
| Twitching of the:  
Pectoralis  
Deltoid  
Tricep  
Bicep  
Forearm  
Hand muscles | Brachial plexus stimulation | None | Inject local anesthetic |
