Low Anterior Resection     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Low Anterior Resection

This procedure involves the removal of a rectal cancer (tumor) while sparing the sphincter muscles. The sigmoid colon and a portion of the rectum are removed. The descending colon is reconnected to the remaining rectum.

The surgeon also removes nearby lymph nodes and fibrous tissue around the rectum.  
If the patient has previously received radiation and chemotherapy, it is common for a temporary ileostomy to be made.  
  
This case is easy to remember because it involves a second surgeon or Physician’s Assistant inserting an End to End Anastomotic stapler into the rectum for the surgeon to complete the anastomosis between the rectum and sigmoid. This is the most difficult part of the procedure. After the anastomosis has been completed, the pelvis is filled with saline and a proctoscope is inserted into the rectum. The rectum is filled with air, and the absence of air bubbles in the saline confirms the stapler created an airtight seal at the new bowel connection.**  
  
Indications**: Some stage I rectal cancers; most stage II or III cancers in the upper third of the rectum. These procedures can be laparoscopic, lap hand assisted, robotic and sometimes open. It all depends on the scar tissue from previous radiation.  
If laparoscopic, you won’t have to hydrate the patient as much because it is not an open belly, thus less insensible water loss.

**Anesthetic**: General/ETT  
**Nitrous Oxide:** No  
**Duration:** 1-3 hours  
**IV Access:** 1 18G for a lap, and 2 for an open procedure.  
**Typed and Screened:** Yes  
**OG Tube:** Yes, unless the surgeon wants an NG tube. NG tubes are becoming more rare.  
**A-Line:** Not indicated.  
**Neo Drip:** On standby.  
**EBL:** 50-200mLs; depends on whether or not it’s an open procedure.  
**Position:** Lithotomy and steep Trendelenburg.  
**Bowel Prep:** Usually  
**Fluid Deficit:** 1-2 liters depending on the bowel prep. The patient will need hydrating. Do not use too many crystalloids, as this may cause the bowel to swell. We usually start with 2 liters of crystalloids then follow with Albumin for an open belly case.  
Foley: Yes

**  
Possible Complications**:  
Port site hernia  
Ileus  
Bowel obstruction  
Abdominal abscess  
Anastomotic leak  
Wound infection

**More Notes**:  
Low anterior resection combined with colon-anal anastomosis provides a good treatment for mid-rectal cancers and for some distal rectal cancers. The double-staple anastomosis (hook-up) is performed using a circular stapler.
