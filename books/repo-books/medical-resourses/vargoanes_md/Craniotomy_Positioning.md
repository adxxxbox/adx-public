Myelomeningocele Review   

### Craniotomy Positioning

  
_Edited by Chrissy Salts, CRNA_

The bed is almost always rotated 90-180 degrees. Make sure to have machine circuit tubing fully extended and extensions available. Common positions include:

**Ventral/Prone  
Supine  
Sitting position  
Lateral position (park bench position)**

**Prone:**  
Prone position increases intra-abdominal pressure, decreases venous return to the heart, and increases systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. All these can increase ICP.  
The patient is positioned face down. The head is stabilized by a horseshoe headrest or Mayfield Head holder. Sometimes the head is flexed, chin towards chest, with the legs slightly bent to prevent the patient from sliding from the operating table.

**Advantages of Prone Position**  
\- Good midline and lateral surgical exposure  
\- Low risk of air embolism  
\- Better hemodynamic stability with a minimal risk of hypotension.

**Disadvantages of Prone Position  
**\- More blood loss versus the sitting position  
\- Difficult to get access to the airway  
\- Head is flexed towards the chest and the ETT can kink. An armored, or reinforced ETT, can be used. There should be two finger-breadths between the chin and chest.  
\- Ischemia and risk of retinal bleeding due to compression in the orbital area.  
\- Danger of necrotic lesions of the face area and other points of support, which can be avoided by careful positioning and padding.  
\- Corneal abrasions

**Considerations for Prone Position:**  
\- Avoid orbital compression. Consider Robinul extra tape for the ETT. Excess saliva can loosen tape resulting in accidental extubation.  
  
\- Arms are usually tucked. Make sure all drips are connected and IVs are patent to prevent issues during the case.  
  
\- If the bed has bolsters, make sure the patient is placed properly on them to permit adequate diaphragmatic excursion and does not compress femoral and abdominal venous return.

Possible causes of increased intracranial pressure:  
Increased intra-abdominal pressure  
Compression of internal jugular veins  
Venous congestion  
Head positioned below the level of the heart

**Supine Position:  
**\- The most frequently utilized position for a craniotomy.  
\- Arms at the sides.  
\- Ensure access to IV, especially for infants and children with arms under the sterile drapes.  
\- Head can be rotated or neutral. Caution with rotated heads on neonates and children. Rotation can lead to the ETT being pushed into the right mainstem bronchus.  
\- Larger children can be positioned similar to adults with slight leg flexion with pillows under knees-promotes venous drainage and decreases back strain.  
\- Padding for heels, elbows and wrists

**Sitting Position:  
Advantages of Sitting Position**  
\- Optimal exposure for posterior fossa surgery because of tissue retraction  
\- Less risks of cranial nerve injury  
\- Good CSF and venous drainage with decrease of ICP  
\- Less EBL  
\- Easier access to the airway

**Disadvantages of Sitting Position**  
\- Hemodynamic instability.  
\- Risk of Venous Air Embolism  
\- Quadriplegia is a rare event resulting from cervical spine ischemia from neck and head hyperflexion  
\-Sciatic nerve injury from extreme flexion of the hip  
\-Tongue and facial swelling from extreme neck flexion

**Contraindications for Sitting Position.  
**\- Right-to-left shunt in patient with a patent foramen ovale  
\- Signs of cerebral ischemia when upright and awake  
\- Cardiac instability

**Considerations for Sitting Position:**  
\- Prepare for decrease in BP with sitting up. The plan for this will vary based on age, weight and condition of the patient.  
\- Zero the A-line transducer at the level of the head to account for the possibility BP at the head level could be around 25% below the heart level.  
\- The ear is about the same level as the Medial Communicating Artery (MCA)  
\- Keep CPP >60mmHg, A-line MAP zeroed at head level  
\- Arterial pressure is reduced 0.77mmHg for every cm gradient above the heart. The vertical distance between the heart and head can be 22-90cm depending on the patient’s height. There can be a relative difference in perfusion pressure between the brain and level of the heart.  
\- If Mayfield head holder is used, have extra Propofol and/or Esmolol. The surgeon will adjust the U-frame and skull clamp to get the desired neck flexion and head position.  
\- Ask the surgeon ahead of time if the head will be flexed, chin towards chest. If so, consider an armored ETT to avoid kinking.  
\- At least 1-2 finger-breadths between chin and chest to prevent cervical spinal cord stretching and venous obstruction. This will depend on the size of the baby or child.

**Precordial Transthoracic Doppler:**  
\- Recommended for early detection of Venous Air Embolism (VAE)  
\- A Peds TEE is more sensitive in detecting a VAE

**The Park-Bench Position (modified lateral):**  
\- Can take the longest to position the patient  
\- Provides better access to the posterior fossa as compared to the lateral position  
\- Upper arm is positioned along the lateral trunk  
\- Have an axillary roll available  
\- Upper shoulder is taped toward the table  
\- Lower extremities are slightly flexed with a pillow between them  
\- Reverse Trendelenburg and too much flexion of the legs at hips and knees should be avoided. This can cause lower extremity venous stasis. Sequential compression leggings are the solution.

**Risks of Park-Bench Position:**  
\- Brachial plexus injury may occur if the upper arm is pulled caudally to gain access to the retro-mastoid area  
\- Extreme neck flexion is associated with the risk of quadriplegia  
\- Injury to the ulnar nerve at the elbow and the peroneal nerve at the knee is also possible

**Lateral:  
**\- Positioning the patient in the lateral position could take longer than the other positions -- This position is for access to posterioparietal, occipital lobe, lateral basilar, pineal or posteriomedial lesions  
\- Allows the dependent occipital or parietal lobe to fall away from the midline by gravity permitting better visualization and requiring less traction to the given area  
\- An Axillary roll is indicated  
\- The legs are flexed and padded with pillows.

**Lateral Sub-occipital Approach:**  
\- The neck of the patient is rotated to the side of the lesion  
\- Causes of Venous Congestion increasing ICP  
\- Insufficient abdominal bolstering  
\- Hyper-rotation or flexion of the neck  
  
**Positioning Aids and Supports:  
**\- Mayfield Pin Head Holder  
\- Horseshoe headrest  
\- Foam head support  
\- Bean Bag (vacuum mattress)  
\- Wilson-type frame  
\- Andrews type frame
