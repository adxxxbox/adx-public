### ORIF of the Radius or Ulna

The surgery depends on where or what type the fracture is.

The fractures can be Simple, Wedge or Complex. The anesthesia is still the same. The surgeon will have already assessed for nerve damage. The patient should already have a splint on and it will not be removed until the patient is asleep. The C-arm will be used.

**Anesthetic:** General/LMA or ETT depending on NPO status.  
Regional is optional: an Axillary or Infraclavicular Block along with a Propofol drip is common.

**Position**. Supine, hand table; tourniquet over the bicep area; all bony prominences well padded.  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours.  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
IV and BP cuff on the non-operative arm.

**Complications:**  
Soft tissue (tendon, nerve, arterial or fascial complications, reflex sympathetic dystrophy) or bone and joint (malunion, nonunion, osteoarthritis).  
Nerve Complications: Nerve injuries associated with distal radius fractures are more common than believed. The Median nerve is most frequently involved.  
Vascular complications are uncommon.  
Compartment syndrome after distal radius fracture is rare and is likely to occur in young adults suffering from a high-energy trauma.  
Malunion is the most common complication of a distal radius fracture.
