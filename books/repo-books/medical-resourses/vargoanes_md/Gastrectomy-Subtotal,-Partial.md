Gastrectomy (Subtotal, Partial)     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Gastrectomy (Subtotal, Partial)

This is considered the preferred treatment for gastric cancer at the area of the antrum.

A subtotal Gastrectomy is the removal of up to three-quarters of the lower stomach, including all of the antrum. The remaining stomach may then be anastomosed directly to the duodenum (Billroth I) or to the jejunum (BillrothII). Nearby lymph nodes are also removed, sometimes along with other nearby organs. Digestion is much easier after surgery when only part of the stomach removed.  
 

**Billroth I Procedure: T**he remaining portion of the stomach is reattached to the duodenum above the bile duct and the duct of the pancreas.  
 

**Billroth II Procedure:** If the stomach cannot be reattached to the duodenum, a Billroth II is performed. The remaining portion of the duodenum is sealed off, a hole is cut into the next section of the small intestine jejunum and the stomach is reattached at this hole.  
  
This procedure can be done by laparoscopy or open. Laparoscopy is becoming more popular due to less blood loss and quicker recovery.  
 

**For Open Procedure:**  
A midline incision is made and the stomach is freed from its attachments. The remaining upper portion of the stomach is sutured and connected to either the duodenum or jejunum.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT and usually a Thoracic Epidural.  
**RSI:** Usually always.  
Avoid Nitrous.  
**A-line:** Yes  
**Duration:** 2-4 hours  
**EBL:** varies, usually < 200  
**IV Access:** 2 Large Bore IVs.  
**Position:** Supine, arms usually tucked.  
**NG Tube:** Yes, intra-operatively right after inductions of GETA. The surgeon should verify placement while he/she has direct access, than you can secure it.  
  
Laparoscopic Gastrectomies are more popular now. Benefits are reduced blood loss, shorter time to resumption of oral intake, and earlier discharge from hospital.

**Possible Complications**: One study showed up to a 25% rate of surgical complications post Billroth II procedure.  
 

**An Anastomotic leak** can be fatal postoperatively. An Anastomotic leak, although infrequent, is a life-threatening complaint and requires prompt recognition and aggressive surgical treatment.

  
Dumping syndrome is uncommon and usually resolves within one year.
