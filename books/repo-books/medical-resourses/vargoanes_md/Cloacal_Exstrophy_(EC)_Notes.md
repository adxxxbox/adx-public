### **Cloacal Exstrophy (EC) Notes**

**![](ec_anes.png)**  
**Cloacal exstrophy** (**EC**) is a severe birth defect in which much of the bladder and intestines are exposed outside the abdominal wall. It often causes the splitting of both male and female genitalia and the anus is occasionally sealed. It may look like a small omphalocele in the perineum.

In boys, the penis is usually flat and short with the exposed inner surface of the urethra on top. The penis is sometimes split into a right and left half. In girls, the clitoris is split and there may be one or two vaginal orifices.

EC is also known as **OEIS Syndrome** because of the four features that are typically found together:

1\. **Omphalocele**: Some of the abdominal organs protrude through an opening in the abdominal muscles in the area of the umbilical cord- contained by a sac.  
  
2\. **Exstrophy of the bladder and rectum**: The bladder is open and separated into two halves. The rectum and colon are similarly open and the segment of the rectum is placed between the bladder halves on the surface of the abdomen.  
  
3\. **Imperforate anus**: The anus has not been formed or perforated and the colon connects to the bladder.  
  
4\. **Spinal defects**: These defects may either be major or minor. Often children born with cloacal exstrophy are also born with some degree of spina bifida. Cloacal exstrophy is an extremely rare birth defect, present in only one in 200,000 pregnancies—one in 400,000 live births.  
  
Frequency of occurrence is 1:200,000 live births  
Boys more commonly affected than girls  
Almost 50% are premature.
