### Cardioplegia: Cold versus Normothermic

**Crystalloid Cardioplegic** solutions are usually delivered at 4C.  
**Blood Solution** is usually delivered at 10-16C.  
**Warm Blood Solutions are delivered at 37C.**  
  
Adequacy of cardioplegia distribution can be confirmed by monitoring the myocardial temperature.  
The surgeon inserts a small temperature probe into the septum first (most vulnerable area). It may subsequently be re-positioned by the surgeon.  
  
Merely arresting the heart decreases myocardial oxygen demand (MVO2) by 97%.  
  
**Cold cardioplegia** is preferred. Its viscosity is still low and easily reaches the subendocardium, rapidly cooling the myocardium and resulting in sustained arrest.  
Myocardial temperature is usually kept below 15C. Uses This is achieved by intermittent hypothermic infusions and provides consistent myocardial protection.  
Cold cardioplegia is preferred when prolonged aortic-cross clamp is required.  
  
**Blood Cardioplegia**  
Many studies show direct evidence that normothermic cardioplegia offers enhanced myocardial protection compared with that resulting from hypothermic cardioplegia. Certain subsets of patients may derive more benefit from normothermic cardioplegia, although it is unclear whether this would be the case for all patients.
