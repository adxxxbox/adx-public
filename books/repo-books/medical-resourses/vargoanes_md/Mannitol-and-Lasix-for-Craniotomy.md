### Mannitol and Lasix for Craniotomy (Open)

**Mannitol for Craniotomy  
Warning:** Always check to see if the patient is at risk for CHF before giving Mannitol.  
  
Mannitol remains the diuretic of choice in reducing intraoperative brain edema and lowering ICP.  
It works faster than Lasix, so it’s the preferred drug for RAPIDLY decreasing ICP.  
It decreases 100ccs of water from the patient’s brain.  
Decreases in ICP are seen in 30 minutes.  
Maximum effects occur within 1-2 hours.  
Urinary Output could reach 1-2L within 1 hour after administration.  
**Dose:** 0.25-1 g/kg over 10-15 minutes..  
**Popular Dose:** 12.5-25 grams of Mannitol is best given around the time of skin incision so that the benefit occurs with opening the dura. More Mannitol may be given if the brain is still “tight”. The surgeon still tells you when to give it.

**Text Book-**: **Mannitol Can Transiently Increase ICP**  
Textbooks tell us that when we initially give Mannitol (before it’s filtered by the kidneys), a rapid intra- and extracellular shift of water can transiently increase intravascular volume and cerebral blood volume. This is from the vasodilator effects of hyperosmolality. This can challenge a compromised heart and cause pulmonary edema in a patient with a poor reserve.  
This initial volume expansion does not occur when given slowly over 20-30 minutes.  
However, we usually see a HYPOtension and not hypertension, especially if we administer Mannitol too fast.

**Method of Action**  
Mannitol goes directly through the glomeruli and none of it is reabsorbed from the renal tubules. While in the tubules, it osmotically prevents the reabsorption of water, Na, Cl and HCO3, thus increasing urinary output.

Even in the presence of a relatively intact Blood-Brain Barrier, the increased plasma osmolality promotes removal of water from areas of normal brain.  
  
**Lasix (Furosemide) with a Craniotomy**  
Studies show that Lasix decreases CSF production, and this effect can explain the synergism between Mannitol and Lasix on decreasing ICP. The maximal effects of Lasix are delayed compared with Mannitol. Lasix may also act primarily by reducing cellular swelling, rather than by changing extracellular fluid volumes.

**Class:** Loop Diuretic.  
Not a potassium-sparing diuretic (patient will excrete K).  
Lasix is a sulfonamide diuretic.  
  
**Doses**:  
0.5-1mg/kg  
20-40 mg is the popular doses ordered by the surgeon.  

**Method of Action**  
Inhibition of the reabsorption and resultant increased excretion of Na, Cl, K, Ca, H20, and PO in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle.  
Increased elimination of potassium, magnesium and calcium.  
Unlike the thiazide diuretics, Lasix and other loop diuretics are still effective when the renal functions are severely limited.  
Commonly given with Mannitol for Craniotomies and open AAAs.
