D & E for Molar Pregnancy    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### D & E for Molar Pregnancy

Refer to “Molar Pregnancy” in Coexisting Diseases & Surgery App for details.  
  
80% of molar pregnancies are uncomplicated and follow an unremarkable course.  
However, for the remaining 20%, complications can be severe and may lead to substantial morbidity and mortality in otherwise healthy women.  
  
Evacuation of the uterus via D & E is the treatment for molar pregnancy.Some complete moles are characterized by penetration of large swollen (hydropic) villi and trophoblasts into the myometrium via direct extension through tissue or venous channels.During evacuation of the uterus, blood loss may be substantial.  
Some of these patients arrive in the ER already hemorrhaging and are directly admitted to the OR from there.  
  
Always speak with the attending surgeon to get an estimate of anticipated blood loss.  
  
**Surgical and anesthesia concerns:  
**High output cardiac failure (secondary to thyrotoxicosis)  
Thyrotoxicosis (thyroid storm)  
Hypertension  
Embolization of trophoblastic materials into pulmonary arteries.  
Hypovolemia  
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)  
Hemorrhage  
Preeclampsia**  
  
Labs:**  
CBC  
Type and crossmatchThyroid function tests  
BMP  
Serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hGC)  
  
**Assess for hyperthyroidism:  
**Hyperthyroidism in molar pregnancy is attributed to excess hCG, which has a weak thyroid stimulating activity  
hCG and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptors are similar; hCG can act directly on TSH receptors in the thyroidExtremely elevated levels of hCG in patients with molar pregnancy or other trophoblastic diseases can lead to hyperthyroidism.  
Plasmapheresis has been performed emergently to decrease the serum T3 and T4 concentrations  
**Anesthesia and uterine relaxation:  
**Uterine muscles have both alpha and beta receptors.Inhalation agents have known tocolytic effects.  
Sevoflurane, desflurane and isoflurane depress uterine activity (enhance uterine relaxation) in a dose dependent fashion.  
They act on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA 1 ) receptors and voltage sensitive Ca \+ and Na \+ channels.  
A dose more than 0.75 MAC results in uterine atony and may increase blood loss.  
N 2 O has minimal effects.  
Ephedrine has little effect.  
Large doses of phenylephrine can cause tetanic uterine contractions.  
  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
Spinal anesthesia has been used, but is not advised due to patient awareness during a potential massive hemorrhage.  
  
**Duration:** 30 minutes to 2 hours  
**EBl:** 250ml - 7 liters  
**A-line** should be present or immediately available.  
**Note:** Patient’s arm should be abducted on an arm board and available for quick arterial line insertion, if needed.  
**Central Line** is no longer commonly used.  
**IV Access:** 2 large bore IVs.  
**Blood available:** 2 units of PRBC should be immediately available in the room or close by.  
**Position:** Lithotomy with arms abducted on arm boards.  
  
**Post op:  
**Thyroid function tests done 24 hours postoperatively to show improvement, but may remain abnormal.  
  
**Possible complications:  
**Severe hemorrhage  
Anemia  
Hyperthyroidism  
Thyrotoxicosis  
Acute cardiopulmonary distress  
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
