# Cardene

**Cardene (Nicardipine)**  
0.1mg/mL in mg/hour  
  
**Class:** Ca Channel Blocker.  
A Dihydropyridine.  
Seems to be replacing Nitroglycerine drips.  
Supplied in 25mg 10mL vial (2.5mg/mL).  
  
**Doses:**  
25 mg of Cardene in a 250 mL bag = 100mcg (0.1mg)/mL.  
20 mg of Cardene in a 200 mL bag = 100mcg (0.1mg)/mL.  
  
**Dose Range:** 5-15 mg/hour  
**Maintenance Dose:** 5mg/mL.  
**Maintenance Dose:** 5mg/hour  
**Acute Hypertension** Many start out at 15mg/hour and titrate down in increments of 5mg/hour.  
**Text Book:** Initially start at 5mg/hour and work up Q15 minutes in increments of 2.5mg/hour.  
  
**MOA:**  
Binds to voltage - gated ion channels, thus blocking Ca influx into vascular smooth and cardiac muscle. Does not affect Ca serum levels. Decreases arterial BP via peripheral arterial vasodilatation (PVR).  
  
**Hemodynamics:** May have increased HR 5-10 bpm compensating for a decrease in SVR and BP (systolic and diastolic). Increases ICP.  
Increases ejection fraction and cardiac output with no significant change, or a small decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP).  
In patients with CAD it improves L.V. diastolic distensability during the early filling phase. There is little or no effect on normal myocardium.  
**Drip-Primarily for:** Hypertension without decreasing heart rate.  
  
**Advantages:**  
Does not depress LV function. Does not adversely increase ICP (acceptable choice in stroke patients).  
**Major limitation:** longer half-life, which precludes rapid titration.  
Nicardipine is metabolized extensively by the liver; less than 1% of intact drug is detected in the urine.  
  
**Direct Contraindications**  
Advanced Aortic Stenosis  
Allergic to Cardene  
Hypotension  
  
**Contraindicated:**  
Heart block  
Recent AMI  
Renal failure  
CHF  
Caution with CHF patients or substantial left ventricular dysfunction, especially in those receiving concomitant β-adrenergic blocking agents.  
  
**Adverse Effects:**  
The usual from expected consequences of vasodilation.  
Headache  
Hypotension
