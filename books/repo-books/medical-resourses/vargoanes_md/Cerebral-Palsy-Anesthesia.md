### Cerebral Palsy and Anesthesia

**Pre-procedure**  
Remember that CP patients with spasticity have increased motor neuron activity (muscle spasticity) and their ongoing care goal is to decrease the excitation of these alpha motor neurons while preserving motor and sensory function.  
  
**Pre-op Assessment  
**Establish patient’s level of communication and cognition. Two-thirds of patients will have some degree of impaired intellectual and cognitive function  
Assess state of hydration; dehydration is common.  
  
**Time of last seizure:** 25-35% of CP patients have seizure disorders.  
  
**Does the patient still ambulate?** If not, suspect a limited cardiopulmonary reserve due to lack of exercise.  
  
**Cardiac:** EKG is not routinely done, but may be helpful if indicated.  
  
**Respiratory:** Reactive airway and restricted airway may be present due to scoliosis and may easily be exacerbated. Respiratory muscle strength may be limited.  
Excessive drooling may be present due to excessive salivation and impaired swallowing.  
  
**Lab work:** CBC and basic metabolic panel (BMP); LFTs (CP meds may be hepatotoxic).  
  
**Caution:** Anti-seizure medications can lead to gingival hyperplasia, megaloblastic anemia, and altered responses to drugs metabolized by the liver.  
  
**Latex Allergy:** CP patients are at increased risk of latex allergy due to repeated catheterization.  
  
**Skin and nails:** Abnormalities may suggest specific micronutrient deficiencies. Many pediatric patients are malnourished with reduced growth and body weight measurements.  
  
**Residential or assisted care living?** Patients in residential care facilities may have a significantly greater weight, height, skinfold thickness and better nourished than those in assisted care living.  
  
**Increase room temperature:** These patients are prone to hypothermia; their termoregulatory mechanisms are similar to those of neonates. They have large surface area to body weight ratios and cannot conserve heat effectively.  
  
Continue their anticonvulsants and antispasticity meds to avoid problems with acute withdrawal and worsening of seizure control.  
  
Avoid pre-op sedation for hypotonic patients because it may accentuate problems with upper airway muscle tone and increase the risk of aspiration perioperatively.

**GERD with impaired pharyngeal function:**  
Increased pooling of oral secretions are common; typically these are medically managed with anti-reflux agents, antacids, and anticholinergics.  
  
Premedicate with robinul if excessive drooling is present to facilitate tracheal intubation, unless the patient has already had salivary gland surgery.  
**Medications:** **common medications used to treat cerebral palsy include:**  
Anticholinergics (uncontrolled body movements).  
Anticonvulsants (seizure medications).  
Antidepressants (depression medications).  
Antispasmodics (muscle relaxants).  
Anti-inflammatories (pain management).  
Stool softeners.  
  
**Botulinum toxin (Botox A)** \- acts peripherally  
  
**Dantrolene sodium:** Affects muscle cell membrane, causes weakness. Hepatotoxic. This drug is not prescribed for ambulatory patients.  
  
Centrally acting, muscle tone-reducing medications may decrease spasticity and seizures but cause central nervous system side effects.  
**Baclofen (Lioresal):** acts centrally  
**Diazepam (Valium):** acts centrally  
**Vigabatrin (Sabril):** acts centrally  
**Tizanidine (Zanaflex):** Acts centrally. Has alpha adrenergic and sedative effects. Hepatotoxic. Given at bedtime due to pronounced sedation.  
**Valproate:** Acts centrally, antiseizure, increases GABA, contributes to liver toxicity.  
**Tranxene (Clorazepate Dipotassium)** GABA A mild sedation benzodiazepine analogue  
**Carbamazepine (Tegretol):** antiepileptic**Clonazepam (Klonipin)  
Valproic Acid (Depakene):** may cause transient thrombocytopenia and red cell aplasia. Acquired von Willebrand disease may increase intraoperative bleeding.  
  
The most common side effect of the above agents is sedation, which may not be well-tolerated and therefore unacceptable.  
  
**Airway assessment:  
**Difficult airway is prevalent due to:  
Upper extremity or neck contracture  
Drooling  
Dental malocclusion  
Dental caries, loose teeth  
Accompanying temporomandibular joint ankylosis  
  
**Aspiration risk  
**As a result of ineffective cough and chronic aspiration of pooled pharyngeal secretions, the development of recurrent pneumonia and respiratory morbidity is common. Chronic aspiration produces pulmonary mucosal damage leading to the development of reactive airway disease.  
  
**Anesthesia**  
**General/ETT with RSI  
**Many of these patients have gastric tubes as a result of their neurological dysfunction that impairs mobility and feedings. This introduces an aspiration risk. Many have severe GERD.  
  
**Propofol** is the preferred anesthetic for induction.  
**Inhalation induction:** HOB should be elevated 20-30 degrees.  
**Neuraxial anesthesia** is rare and can be difficult due to muscle contracture and bone development.  
**Post op epidural dosing:** A continuous infusion of dilute bupivacaine or ropivacaine, narcotic (fentanyl or dilaudid) and clonidine is effective for post-op analgesia. These methods produce fewer side effects than IV narcotics.  
  
**Versed, succinylcholine and muscle relaxants**  
Epilepsy is a common comorbidity in spastic quadriplegia. The choice of anesthetic and muscle relaxants must be guided by consideration of maintenance medications.  
  
**Versed:**  
Anti-seizure medications can affect CYP450 degradation pathways and cause reduced metabolism of and response to midazolam and other benzodiazepines.  
  
**Narcotics:** Use should be minimized. These patients are likely to experience prolonged somnolence. Patients with cerebral palsy are more susceptible to over-sedation, impaired cough, and respiratory depression.  
  
**IV Tylenol and NSAIDS** are especially useful.**Robinul** is a useful antisialogogue.  
**Muscle Relaxants:** Non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (especially vecuronium) are less potent and have a shorter duration of action in patients with CP due to the up-regulation of Ach receptors. Higher and repeated doses may be needed.  
  
This effect may be offset by the pre-existing dehydration.  
  
The usual approach is to avoid neuromuscular blocking agents whenever possible.  
  
Use of **succinylcholine** in CP patients is controversial. Despite increased skeletal muscle spasticity, succinylcholine does NOT produce an abnormal efflux of intracellular potassium. Due to the presence of extrajunctional acetylcholine receptors, succinylcholine dose must be reduced.  
  
**Volatile anesthetics:** Commonly used.  
  
**Positioning:**  
Spasticity in a child undergoing skeletal maturation precipitates upper and lower extremity joint contractures and dislocation. Limb contractures are thus prevalent.  
  
Non-weight-bearing long bones become osteopenic and vulnerable to fracture.  
  
Warning: Non-ambulatory children with cerebral palsy are at increased risk for hip dislocation, compared with their ambulatory counterparts.  
  
Position the patient CAREFULLY with appropriate padding.  
  
Don’t force any position. Use positioning aids and pillows or blankets for padding. Forcing a position can cause skeletal or nerve damage. All members of the perioperative team are responsible for positioning. Consult the attending surgeon if special positioning considerations affect surgical access.  
  
**Hypothermia:** Many patients with CP lack thermoregulation. Use a fluid warmer and underbody warming blanket when possible. Hypothermia is a common post-op complication.  
  
Heat loss is a major consideration in CP patients due to their thin skin, lack of subcutaneous fat, and atrophic musculature.  
  
**Core temperature monitoring** is preferred to skin temperature monitoring.  
  
**Foley catheter** should be considered to better assess fluid status during longer cases.  
  
**Hydration** must be assessed and carefully managed.  
  
**Blood loss:** Depends on the procedure. CP muscle contracts poorly when surgically incised. This can result in significant blood loss during major surgery. Consider tranexamic acid, cell saver and a possible blood transfusion.  
  
**Emergence  
**Awake extubation: prolonged somnolence is common in these patients.  
  
**Postop  
**Consider ICU  
  
**Common post operative issues**  
Hypothermia  
Postoperative pain  
Anxiety  
Hypotension: undiagnosed dehydration may contribute to hypotension.  
Hypoxemia: pulmonary status is highly compromised post-surgery due to diminished cough reflex and reduced respiratory drive.  
  
Hypothermia, pain and anxiety can trigger acute muscle spasms which are often more painful and distressing to the patient than the operation itself.  
  
Given the impaired communication barrier with many CP patients, continuous analgesia is preferred to PRN administration.
