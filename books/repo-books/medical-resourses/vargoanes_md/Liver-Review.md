### Liver Review

**  
Liver Function**:  
Metabolism of drugs and toxins. The liver works at removing degradation products of normal body metabolism; for example, clearance of ammonia and bilirubin from the blood.  
The liver synthesizes many important proteins and enzymes such as clotting factors.

The liver produces bile, a liquid that helps dissolve fat and eliminate metabolic waste and toxins via the intestine. Each hepatocyte creates bile and excretes it into microscopic channels that join to form bile ducts. Like tributaries joining to form a river, the bile ducts join to form a single "hepatic duct" that brings bile into the intestine.

The liver is located in the right upper quadrant of the abdominal cavity. It is divided into eight segments reflecting the eight major divisions of the portal vein and the bile duct.  

**Blood enters the liver from two vessels**:  
**Hepatic artery Portal vein**  
Total flow 25% 75%  
Supplies 45-50% 50-55%  
O2 Sat 98% 85%  
Receptors A1,B2,D1 A1,D1  
  
Small changes in hepatic portal venous tone and pressure can result in large changes in hepatic blood volume, allowing the liver to act as a reservoir.

A decrease in hepatic venous pressure from a hemorrhage, for example, shifts blood from hepatic veins and sinusoids to into the central venous circulation. This can be 300ml.

Normal hepatic blood volume is around 500mLs.  
Increased CVP- the liver can remove and hold 1 liter of blood from circulation but may have some hepatic congestion exposure to the biliary products, leading to acute tubular necrosis.

Blood leaves the liver via the hepatic veins, which drains into the inferior vena cava and immediately enters the heart.

**Patients with liver disease can be**:  
Hyperdynamic.  
Increased CO.  
Decreased SVR.  
Decreased Albumin, thus making drugs more potent.  

**Goal**: Avoid Hypotension

**Note**: Isoflurane undergoes minimal biodegradation, and preserves hepatic blood flow and oxygen delivery.
