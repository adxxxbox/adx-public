### Epidural Test Dose - Results from an Intrathecally Placed Epidural

**When the Epidural Catheter is unintentionally inserted in the Intrathecal (subarachnoid) Space  
  
**The normal test dose of lidocaine and epinephrine should allow easy identification of an inadvertent subarachnoid (intrathecal) placement of the catheter _without causing high or total spinal anesthesia and hemodynamic compromise._  
  
_A test dose injected into the intrathecal space will cause a low sensory and motor block at 5 minutes._  
  
**Just 45 mg of lidocaine injected into the CSF per epidural catheter from the L2-L3 or L3-L4 will produces the following:**  
**A) Sensory block -** At the S2 dermatome level and it occurs in 1-2 minutes. **Symptoms:** Leg warmth and sensory loss to pinprick  
If the patient is sitting up, her butt and legs will get heavy and numb.  
If the patient is lateral, both her legs and possibly abdomen will get numb  
**B)** **Motor block -** Legs within 4-5 minutes  
Leg weakness and heaviness  
Inability or difficulty performing a straight leg raise  
Difficult ambulation  
_(NOTE: The single episode of a positive intrathecal test dose that I observed was quite impressive – that patient could not have stood, let alone ambulated.)_ _Jim Carroll, CRNA  
  
_**Normal (non-test dose) bolus injected into the intrathecal space is dangerous  
**If you initially injected a LARGE bolus into the intrathecal space, the patient may experience a high block (high spinal). This is why all the literature states that all epidural boluses should not exceed 5 mLs.  
  
A subarachnoid positive test dose is nothing to panic about. Today, many anesthesia providers just leave the catheter in the subarachnoid space and run a continuous infusion at a low spinal rate. Some anesthesia providers will remove catheter and insert another catheter.  
  
**_NOTE:_** _Some have advocated leaving the catheter in the intrathecal space for 24 hours in hopes this would decrease the probability of PDPH. They theorize that a resulting fibrin clot prevents CSF leakage._
