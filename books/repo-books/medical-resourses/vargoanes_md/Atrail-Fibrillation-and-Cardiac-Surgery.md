### Atrial Fibrillation and Cardiac Surgery

17-35% of patients at one point acquire new postoperative atrial fibrillation (“A-fib’). To reduce the incidence or clinical sequelae of postoperative atrial fibrillation, beta blockers should be administered for at least 24 hours before CABG to all patients in whom this is not contraindicated.  
  
Preoperative administration of amiodarone to reduce the incidence of postoperative A-Fib is reasonable for patients at high risk for postoperative A-Fib in whom beta blockers are contraindicated.  
  
Prophylaxia of atrial fibrillation may be achieved by pre-op use of amiodarone (IV or PO) and beta blockers in combination.  
  
Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers have replaced digoxin as first-line therapy for A-Fib rate control. Randomized studies have confirmed the superiority of beta-blockers in controlling the ventricular response.  
Although beta blockers are not generally regarded as membrane-stabilizing agents, they may protect against A-Fib by delaying atrial repolarization  
  
**Sotalol (Betapace),** a nonselective beta blocker, can help reduce perioperative A-Fib and is considered more of an atrial stabilizer than metoprolol.  
  
The **Maze procedure** (surgical ablation) may be used in patients with long-standing pre-existing atrial fibrillation associated with valvular disease. This procedure takes minutes with the chest open, whereas ablation may take hours in the electrophysiology lab.  
  
**Amiodarone** can be started.  
  
As a result of manipulation of the heart during surgery, atrial fibrillation may occur with a rapid ventricular response greater than 150 bpm. Rhythm may be restored by using internal paddles at 10-20 Joules. Beta blockers, if not contraindicated, should be administered for at least 24 hours before CABG to reduce the incidence and clinical sequelae of postoperative atrial fibrillation. If not contraindicated, beta blockers should be re-instituted as soon as possible after CABG to reduce the incidence and severity of atrial fibrillation.
