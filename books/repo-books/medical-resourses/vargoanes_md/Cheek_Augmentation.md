### Cheek Augmentation

Also referred to as malar augmentation.  
  
Cheek implants cosmetically correct cheeks that have gone flat with age or are hollowed.  
The goal of **cheek augmentation** is to add volume or lift to the cheeks.  
  
**Cheek Augmentation Options**  
Fat grafting/transfer (where a patient's own fat is used).  
Cheek silicone implants.  
Injectable fillers (usually do not require anesthesia).  
  
Cheek implant procedures are performed without any external incisions.  
The incisions are made inside of the mouth on either side of the upper lip.  
  
**Cheek implant procedure**  
Hidden bilateral intra-oral incisions.  
The zygoma is then exposed by lifting the overlying soft tissue of the cheek.  
An appropriately sized cheek implant is then chosen based on the type and degree of volume loss.  
Once the implant has been chosen, it is placed over the bone in the desired area.  
The implant is then secured using tiny screws anchored to the bone to prevent unwanted movement of the implant until adequate healing has taken place.  
The incisions are then closed with absorbable sutures.  
  
**Duration:** 1.5 to 3 hours.  
  
**Anesthesia for cheek implants:** Either monitored anesthesia care with deep sedation or general anesthesia with nasotracheal intubation to enable access to oral cavity.  
**Duration:** 1.5-3 hours.  
**Position:** Supine, arms tucked; table rotated 45-90 degrees.  
**EBL:** Minimal.  
  
**Possible Complications  
**Bleeding.  
Infection.  
Poor healing of incisions.  
Hematoma.  
Fluid accumulation (seroma).  
Skin loss.  
Numbness or other changes in skin sensation.  
Skin discoloration and/or prolonged swelling.  
Unfavorable scarring.  
Fatty necrosis of subcutaneous tissue.  
Fatty cysts.  
Deep vein thrombosis, cardiac and pulmonary complications.  
Thick scar tissue around cheek implant (capsular contracture).  
Cheek implant displacement.  
Asymmetry.  
Lumpiness.  
Blindness (rare complication of fat transfer).  
Suboptimal aesthetic result.  
Possibility of revisional surgery.  
Persistent pain.  
Poor aesthetic result of donor site for fat transfer.
