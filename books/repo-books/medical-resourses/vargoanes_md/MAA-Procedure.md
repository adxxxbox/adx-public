### MAA Procedure

MAA (macroaggregated albumin) is the first part of the Yttrium-90 Radioembolization (Y90) procedure.  
  
MAA is the first part. Y90 is the second part performed 1-2 weeks later.  
  
**Goal of MAA:** To seal off the extrahepatic vessels in and around the liver that are NOT supplying blood to the tumor, thus to maximize the efficiency of the Y90 treatment. Goal of Y90: Destroy hepatic tumor cells while sparing surrounding liver tissue. Improve the quality of life and the life span.

**Indication:** Nonresectable primary and metastatic liver cancers.

For us, this is a basic anesthesia procedure done in Intervention Radiology. We usually intubate and maintain muscle relaxation. An A-Line is not indicated. These procedures are usually performed with conscious sedation by radiology RNs. Our services are requested only for the patients that can’t remain still with their sedation.

First part is Scintigraphic Mapping: Before the mapping, a long femoral catheter is inserted and directed into the hepatic artery via the femoral artery. A technetium-99m (Tc-99m) macroaggregated albumin (MAA) scan is performed to map the area targeted for treatment. The interventional radiologist then inserts a catheter and directs it and injects radioactive particles of Tc-99m MAA into the right or left hepatic artery. This mapping is vital to assure tumor-targeted delivery of treatment. These studies allow for documentation of the hepatic and GI vascular anatomy and flow characteristics.

**Second Part of MAA:** Then the Intervention Radiologist uses coil embolization (ablation) to seal off the extrahepatic vessels in and around the liver that are NOT supplying blood to the tumor. This is done to prevent a nontarget deposition of microspheres that can lead to gastrointestinal ulceration and other complications.

After the above, you are to extubate the patient and immediately transport him/her to nuclear medicine and image the lungs and abdomen, including detailed SPECT views of the liver and abdomen to observe for any extrahepatic distribution via a CT-hepatic angiogram.

This is to assess for a possible hepato-pulmonary syndrome. An increased pulmonary shunt fraction (>20%) indicates an increased likelihood of the radioactive particles traveling to the lung during therapy, leading to the adverse side effect of radiation pneumonitis. The Femoral artery catheter will then be removed.

Try to have your patient as awake as possible by the time you deliver the patient to nuclear medicine. There is usually no recovery room in between. You then give report to the nuclear medicine RN and sign off on the patient.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT if our services are requested. Again, most of these are just conscious sedation without anesthesia being involved.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Yes, no movement is recommended. Also, you will be asked multiple times to “Stop Ventilation” during injections for image taking, so you do not want the patient breathing. Same principle as an “Aortogram Runoff”. **Duration:** 2-5 hours. **IV Access:** 20G **EBL:** Minimal **Positioning:** Supine with arms tucked.

**Possible Complications:** Hemorrhage-very rare.  
Vascular Injury.  
Pseudoaneurysm at the Femoral Artery puncture site.  
Gastrointestinal ulceration .  
Postradioembolization syndrome (PRS).  
Hepatic dysfunction..  
Biliary complications-Cholecystitis and/or biliary stricture.  
Portal Hypertension.  
Radiation Pneumonitis..  
Lymphopenia  
Contrast dye allergic reaction.  

**More Notes**  
Hepatic malignancies derive most of their blood supply from the hepatic artery; whereas the normal liver derives most of its blood supply from the portal vein. Therefore, delivery of radioembolic particles through the branch of the hepatic artery supplying a tumor will preferentially lead to deposition of the particles in the tumor, while sparing normal liver cells from harmful side effects.

**Scintigraphy (lung-shunting scan or MAA scan):**

Scintigraphy is an imaging method that uses radioactive materials called radiopharmaceuticals or radiotracers as a dye.

In an MAA scan, the radiotracer MAA is injected into the catheter that has been positioned in the patient’s hepatic artery. The radiotracer spheres are similar in size to the Y90 microspheres and allows the medical team to predict where they will lodge on the day of treatment. A gamma camera and a computer are used to determine the amount and location of radiotracer absorbed by the patient’s body by detecting gamma radiation from MAA. Sometimes some of the radiotracer material will pass through the liver into the lung. The doctor needs to know how much passes through to determine a safe dose of SIR-Spheres microspheres.

No more than 30 Gy of radiation should be shunted to the liver. A contrast CT scan is also obtained to determine the volume of the liver that will receive contrast and radiation.
