### Musculo-Skeletal System

The placenta produces relaxin, a hormone that causes widespread relaxation of ligaments.  
Relaxin induces a widening and increased mobility of the pubis and sacro-iliac joints to allow passage of the fetus through the birth canal.  
Widening of the pubic symphysis occurs by week 30.  
Pain relating to these joints may occur during the later stages of pregnancy.  
  
**Carpel Tunnel Syndrome  
**Relaxin may contribute to Carpel Tunnel Syndrome from the increased fluid absorption in connective tissue.  
  
**Increased Lumbar Lordosis and Back Pain**  
Due to the enlarging uterus, there is a compensatory increase in the lumbar lordosis. Increased back pain occurs with pregnancy.  
Back pain in the post-partum period is also very common and many patients will blame it on the epidural. Ask any chiropractor, they will tell you.  
  
At 12 weeks, almost 20% of pregnant women complain of back pain.  
At 24 weeks, around 47% complain of back pain.  
At 36 weeks, around half complain of back pain. About 25% are recommended therapy post-partum.  
Exercise to strengthen abdominal and back muscle helps.  
  
**Meralgia Paresthetica**  
The exaggerated lumbar lordosis may stretch the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve causing paresthesia or sensory loss over the anterolateral thigh.  
  
**Brachial Plexus Neuropathy  
**May also occur from the anterior flexion of the neck and slumping of the shoulders with pregnancy.
