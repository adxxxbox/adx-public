OSAS increases the risk of postoperative respiratory morbidity from 1% to 20%

The ASA guidelines, suggest that OSA patients should be monitored 3 hours longer than the non-OSA patients before discharge.

Literature states to reserve an ICU bed and overnight stay for kids with severe OSA

**ASA Guidelines:**  
After being weaned to room air in a nonstimulating enviroment, monitoring should be continued for a median of 7 hours after any (or last) obstruction episode or desaturations <92%.

**Narcotics/sedatives:** Try to make sure the child received minimal doses of SHORT acting narcotics. Anything longer acting like dilaudid may contribute to post operative airway obstruction and could drastically increase their time in the PACU with possible admission for an overnight stay.  
  
**Consider alternatives to narcotics if the patient did not receive them earlier:**  
Rectal Tylenol: 30-40mg/kg  
IV Tylenol: 15mg/kg (no greater than 1 gram)  
Toradol: 1mg/kg dose if permitted by surgeon  
Decadron 0.2 - 1.0mg/kg (Max dose 20mg)

_(Decadron study –shows it decreases post-op pain)_

**Possible Post -Op Complications of OSAS  
**Desaturations <90%  
Increased work of breathing  
Pulmonary edema

Lasts 20 seconds and results in bradycardia and cyanosis

Surgery will make this problem worse due to metabolic and pharmacologic problems

Greatest risk is premature infants with PCA (post conceptional age) of less than 44 weeks, children less than 60 wks PCA are hospitalized after surgery

Postpone elective surgery if possible

Titrate opioids carefully

Use regional if possible

Combine the immature respiratory neuro control with the respiratory type II muscles (easily fatigued) , this may be responsible for much of the post op apnea- especially with the preterm infants with gestational age <44weeks.

Prematurely born infants <44 weeks post conception, especially those with a history of apnea, are at high risk (20-40%) of developing post op apnea.

Caffeine and theophylline reduce apnea, strengthen muscle contractility, strengthen muscle contractility, prevent fatigue, and are respiratory stimulants.  
Pulmonary hypertensive crisis  
Atelectasis  
Pulmonary infiltrate  
Pneumothorax  
Pneumomediastinum

**Severe OSAS Possible Complications**  
Laryngospasm  
Pulmonary Edema  
Pulmonary hypertensive crisis  
Pneumonia  
Postoperative Death  
Kids having obstructive issues postoperatively should be positioned laterally or prone
