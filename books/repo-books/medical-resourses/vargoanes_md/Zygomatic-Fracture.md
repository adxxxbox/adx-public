Zygomatic Fracture- Reduction     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Zygomatic Fracture- Reduction

This injury results principally from motor vehicle speeding/reckless driving, drinking and driving, air bag deflations during MVA, fights and sports related injuries.  
Most common symptom encountered: Sensory disturbance of infraorbital nerve (>90%) at the time of presentation, which is usually reduced to about 10% at follow up.

A closed reduction is for simple zygomatic arch fractures.  
An open reduction (ORIF) is done when the fracture is severe (trimalar fracture).

**Anesthetic:** General with Oral Rae.

**Eyes:** Lubricate will eye ointment and cover one or both eyes with tegaderm to fully protect prep solution getting into the patient’s eyes. Small cotton balls are sometimes placed in the ears to prevent prep solution from pooling in the ears. The surgeon may request to tape only one eye so tape intruding into the surgical field.

**Position:** Supine with slight reverse Trendelenburg with one or both arms tucked.   
The bed can be rotated 90 to180 degrees. Make sure you either have ventilator tubing slack or a tubing extension if the surgeon does want to rotate the bed a full 180 degrees. You should find out ahead of time.  
**Relaxation:** Surgeon’s request. We have done many of these without.  
**Duration:** 90-180 minutes  
**IV:** 20G is acceptable  
**EBL:** < 20mLs  
**Emergence:** Depends on the airway. Just remember that you do not want to be in the position to be applying the mask with force on the patient’s face (on the surgical site)  
to maintain an airway -post extubation. Awake extubation is popular.

**Possible Complications:**  
Malpositioning of zygomatic bone lacking facial symmetry.  
Bleeding  
Facial neve damage

Hypoesthetic (reduced or loss of sensation) in areas in the surgical region.
