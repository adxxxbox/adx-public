### Heparin Cofactor II Deficiency  
_Prevents coagulation_

Heparin cofactor II (HCII) is a thrombin inhibitor, the activity of which is dramatically enhanced by heparin and more specifically by dermatan sulfate, another glycosaminoglycan.  
  
HCII has significant antithrombin activity that has been implicated in coagulation, inflammation, atherosclerosis, and wound repair.  
  
Some studies suggest that the concentrations of HCII in plasma inversely correlate with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.  
  
**HCII deficiency:** may lead to venous thromboembolism.  
**High levels of HCII:** It has been suggested that high plasma HCII level could play a protective role against atherosclerosis in elderly individuals and protect from restenosis after femoro-popliteal or coronary artery stenting.  
  
**Lab Tests for HCII  
**Levels can be measured using a antithrombin dermatan sulfate cofactor using an amidolytic assay.  
  
HCII binds to dermatan sulfate with high affinity and efficiently inactivates thrombin, thus preventing coagulation.  
  
Thrombin plays an important role in the development of atherosclerosis and restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention. Because heparin cofactor II (HCII) inhibits thrombin action in the presence of dermatan sulfate, which is abundantly present in the arterial wall, HCII may affect vascular remodeling by modulating thrombin action.  
Some researchers hypothesize that patients with high plasma HCII activity may show a reduced incidence of in-stent restenosis (ISR).
