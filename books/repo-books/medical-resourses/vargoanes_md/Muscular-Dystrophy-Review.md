Muscular Dystrophy   

## Muscular Dystrophy

-   A group of hereditary diseases characterized by painless degeneration and atrophy of skeletal muscles.
-   Incidence: 3:10,000 births
-   The most common and severe is Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy (Pseudohypertrophic MD).
-   Caused by x-linked recessive gene.

**Symptoms typically are present between 2-5 years of age due to proximal pelvic groups of the pelvic girdle.**

-   Waddling gait
-   Frequent falls
-   Difficulty climbing stairs
-   Affected muscles become larger due to fatty infiltration (Pseudohypertrophy)
-   Characterized by progressive skeletal muscle deterioration
-   Most boys are wheelchair bound by 8-10 years of age
-   Increased permeability of skeletal muscle membranes
-   Kyphoscoliosis & long bone fractures
-   Mental retardation is often present.
-   Lifespan is usually only15-25 years due to pneumonia or CHF

**Anesthetic Management:**

Frequently present for muscle biopsy or orthopedic procedures.

**Major concerns:**

-   Increased skeletal muscle permeability
-   Decreased cardiopulmonary reserve
-   GI hypomotolity
-   Succinylcholine is CONTRAINDICATED (rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, cardiac arrest) as are volatile anesthetics (rhabdomyolysis and increased risk of MALIGNANT HYPERTHERMIA).
-   Response to NDMRs is normal.  
      
    

Postoperatively, the patient may sometimes voids dark, cola-colored urine and complains of calf and heel pain. The urine is positive for myoglobin and elevated plasma creatine kinase levels. Get baseline Creatinine Kinase levels. The underlying cause for these 'MH-like' metabolic reactions remains unexplained. The patient who received a 'trigger-free' anesthetic had myoglobinemia but did not have an elevated CK level compared with baseline anesthesia-induced rhabdomyolysis. The urine is positive for myoglobin (>60 ~g·I~I) and plasma creatine kinase levels are >10 000 IU.

Why a small minority of muscular dystrophy patients suffer with AIR after exposure to inhalational anesthetic agents remains unknown.

**Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)  
**Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disease characterized by a lack of dystrophin because of an abnormal dystrophin gene located on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp21 position).

DMD has an incidence of 1 in 3,500 live male births. It is an inherited disorder, with abnormal or absent dystrophin, and this results in chronic muscle fiber necrosis, degeneration, and regeneration. Degeneration occurs in cardiac and smooth muscle and also in skeletal muscle.

Infants with DMD may appear normal at birth; weakness begins in childhood generally before the age of 8, and is rapidly progressive. The muscles around the pelvis and thighs are affected first, the child presenting with difficulty managing stairs and standing from sitting. By adolescence, patients are usually wheelchair-bound and succumb to cardiac or pulmonary manifestations of the disease in their late 20s to early 30s.1 Heterozygous females, although not manifesting the disease, have an increased cardiac risk later in life.

In DMD patients under 8 years of age, muscle fibers are attempting to regenerate, and are more prone to rhabdomyolysis.

Exposure of the sarcolemma to a potent inhalational agent (or succinylcholine) stresses the muscle cell membrane and further increases the instability and permeability. Consequently, intracellular Ca+ levels increase further and cell contents, such as K+ and CK, leak out. A compensatory hypermetabolic response occurs in an attempt to reestablish membrane stability and prevent Ca+ fluxes. This proposed mechanism may explain the hyperkalemia, hyperthermia, tachycardia and rhabdomyolysis observed in these patients.

In the event that AIR is suspected, the inhalational anesthetic agent should be discontinued immediately. Serial serum potassium levels should be measured and immediately treated if greater than 5.5.

To shift potassium back into the muscle cells, intravenous sodium bicarbonate and insulin with 10% dextrose should be administered and the patient hyperventilated to produce a respiratory alkalosis.

Differentiation between AIR and MH may be difficult, especially if the patient is not known to have DMD. However, acute hyperkalemic cardiac arrest or isolated rhabdomyolysis with no signs of systemic hypermetabolism strongly suggest AIR. Conversely, the presence of rapidly rising ETCO2, unexplained metabolic acidosis, inappropriate tachycardia or tachypnea in a spontaneously breathing patient, muscle rigidity and increasing body temperature >38.8°C are consistent with MH.

**Anesthetic Considerations**

-   General considerations for MD are similar to those for other muscular dystrophies
-   The majority of complications are pulmonary: smooth
-   Succinylcholine will produce contractions lasting for several minutes, thus making intubation and ventilation a challenge; thus…
-   Short-acting nondepolarizing muscle relaxants or avoidance of relaxation is therefore advised
-   MD patients can be very sensitive to anesthetic agents, with hypersomnolence and CO2 retention sometimes being observed

Pacing equipment should be readily available because a third of AV blocks may not respond to atropine

Patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy are at increased risk of some anesthesia-related hazards such as rhabdomyolysis, fever and hyperkalemia.
