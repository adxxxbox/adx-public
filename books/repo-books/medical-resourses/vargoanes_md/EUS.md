### EUS (Endoscopic Ultrasound)

From an anesthetic standpoint, this is just an extra-long endoscopy. It involves the passage of a specially designed endoscope that is equipped with an ultrasound probe on its tip, and enables the GI Doc to image the local anatomy of the GI tract and beyond-like the pancreas.

**Equipment:** Appropriate size oral airway, suction and Ambu bag within arm’s reach.

**Bite Block:** A bite block is placed between the teeth to prevent the patient from biting on the endoscope**.** Make sure the bite block is carefully inserted before you start administering Propofol. The patient is more prone to a laryngospasm if they are too light.

As soon as the patient gets in the room, you need to put a Salter ETCO2 sampling NC on so the patient could build up their FRC while you are connecting the monitors. Some GI labs are efficient, with little time between the patient entering the room and the start of the procedure.

**Anesthetic**: General: we rarely intubate unless a possible ERCP will be done also.

TIVA is usually a Propofol infusion. In addition to Propofol, some also give 2 mg. of Versed or combine Versed with Ketamine. I’ve seen Versed given pre-op, and then a bolus of 20mg of Ketamine and 30mg of Propofol before the scope is initially inserted.  
**Bedside Meds:** Robinul, Atropine, Ephedrine and Anectine.  
**Duration:** 5-10 minutes  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**Position:** Head of bed up 25-30%; Most patients are left lateral position, some are supine.  
**Muscle relaxation:** Not needed.  
**IV Access:** 22G is acceptable.  
  

**Warning:** The common EUS scope has an inflatable latex balloon. Inform the doctor if the patient has an allergy to latex. Some doctors are cooperative and will use a different scope (without a balloon). We had a doctor who told us to just give Benadryl and Pepcid. The patient was latex airway sensitive so we administered Benadryl, Pepcid and also intubated.

**Possible Complications:**  
Aspiration pneumonia  
Perforation of the stomach or duodenum  
Infection  

**Airway issues:**  
Do not hesitate to manipulate the airway via chin lift with a jaw thrust if the patient starts to obstruct during the procedure. Do not hesitate to tell the GI doc to pull out the scope if you can’t manage the airway with the tube or dilator in. Don’t feel bad. I could assure you it’s not the first time. He can continue when the SAO2 is back up.

**Bite Block Removal**  
When the procedure is complete, do not remove the bite block until the patient can follow commands and open their mouth. You can damage the patient’s teeth by pulling out the bite block too soon.

**More Notes**  
The EUS is used to detect small tumors in the pancreas, stage gastrointestinal cancers by determining the depth of tumor penetration, and to detect stones in biliary ducts.

An EUS guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) allows biopsy of a lesion to determine the presence of cancer or whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. It is done by passing a very small biopsy needle directly through the gastric wall or the duodenum into the mass and then a needle biopsy or several biopsies are taken. The patient MUST be motionless while the needle biopsy is out and going through intestinal tissue layers; make sure you have a patent airway with the patient breathing adequately before the GI doc starts the FNA. Also, some facilities require antibiotics to be given before or during every FNA so always ask your Gastroenterologist about antibiotic therapy. Some overly cautious GI docs will ask you to not give antibiotics until they have their FNA specimens out.  

There is a Lower EUS. The ultrasound endoscope is passed through the anus for examination of the rectum and colon. Endoscopic ultrasound is most commonly used to diagnose and stage cancers.

EUS is very effective at detecting precancerous lesions and early-stage cancerous lesions of the esophagus, stomach, and rectum.  It can detect tumors present in other organs, such as the pancreas, lungs, and bile duct. 

Patients with Barrett's esophagus and those with multiple family members with pancreatic or colon cancer can benefit from this proactive screening approach.
