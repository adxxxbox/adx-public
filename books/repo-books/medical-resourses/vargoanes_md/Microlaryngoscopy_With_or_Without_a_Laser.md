### Microlaryngoscopy (With or Without Laser)

**Surgical indications:**

Removal of benign lesions of the larynx, e.g., papilloma, fibroma, vocal nodule, polyp, or cyst.

  

**The procedure:**

\- This is a prolonged Direct Laryngoscopy, but the surgeon uses a binocular microscope with a 400 mm lens.

\- It is very stimulating as the patient should be anesthetically deep.

\-First, the surgeon inserts a mouth guard.

\-Then, he/she inserts a large rigid laryngoscope (Jako or Dedo brand).

\-Sometimes, the surgeon will use a self-retaining laryngoscope holder to free the surgeon’s hands.

\-This is all very stimulating so you should be prepared for a hypertensive response.

**Anesthesia management:**

\- Always check with the surgeon preoperatively concerning the preferred surgical plan and type of ETT.

\- A laser or cautery may be utilized, requiring airway fire precautions.

\- Airway fire precautions: Decrease FiO2 to 0.3 (30%)

\- Inform the surgeon of decreases in SaO2 < 90%.

\- If a laser will be utilized, the surgeon may request a laser ETT.

\- Position the monitoring cables and circuit over the chest for a 90-degree bed rotation.

\- Stretch out the ventilator tubing, as you will eventually tape it over the patient’s chest after the bed is rotated 90 degrees.

**Taping the ETT:**

\- The ETT is usually loosely taped in the middle of the lower lip but is not highly secure.

\- Sometimes, the surgeon needs the ETT to be free (not secured) to perform multiple ETT manipulations throughout the case.

**ETT and size:**

\- Usually, 6.0 MLT ETT for adults (non-laser procedures)

\- Muscle relaxation for > 20 minutes, reverse with sugammadex.

\- A standard or ETT of 4.0-6.0 ID mm tends to be too short for the adult trachea.

\- However, an **MLT ETT** is often preferred because they are much longer in length.

\- Refer to **MLT ETT** and **Laser ETT** in this app for more details.

**MLT ETT:**

The nickname for MLT is "mighty long tube"!

The ENT surgeon prefers an extra-long and small-diameter ETT to facilitate the view of the airway for microlaryngoscopy procedures.

**Sizes:**

ID 4.0 mm

ID 5.0 mm

ID 6.0 mm (most common for adults)

**Avoid nitrous oxide:** It supports combustion.

**Possible Regional:** Blockade of the Glossopharyngeal Nerve (rarely performed)

**Antisialagogue:** 0.2 mg of **glycopyrrolate** IV or IM is common preoperatively to dry out the oral cavity.

The less secretions, the better.

**LTA Kit:** YES; by all means, use it if the surgeon does not object.

**Decadron:** Yes, 4-12mg.

**Muscle Relaxant:** Yes, coughing during the laser could severely damage the cords.

**Succinylcholine Drip:** Rarely used anymore because it induces diffuse myalgia and elevated K levels.

I have seen some old-timer CRNAs still using it.

Succinylcholine has the potential to develop a phase II block during unexpectedly long procedures.

**Sux Drip Rate:** 2.5-4.3mg /min.

**Ventilating the patient:**

When lasers are used for airway surgery, ventilation techniques that can be used include jet ventilation. ventilation (subglottic or supraglottic) and intermittent or continuous endotracheal intubation with a variety of tubes.

**Prevent/treat hypertension and tachycardia from severe surgical airway stimulation.**

\- BP and HR often fluctuate strikingly during these procedures due to a series of stress-filled laryngoscopies and intubations separated by varying periods of minimal surgical stimulation.

\- The patient may experience alternating intervals of hypertension and hypotension.

\- Make sure the BP-related medications you administer are very short-acting.

\-Turn your Sevoflurane up.

\- Consider 0.5mg/kg Esmolol just prior to direct laryngoscopy.

\- Consider small boluses of Propofol.

**Remifentanil is optional but not usually administered.**

\- Starting at 0.5-1mcg/kg/min at least 8 minutes before the start of the procedure.

\- Some anesthesia providers just start the infusion prior to induction.

**Duration:** 20-60 minutes.

**Desaturations may occur:**

Desaturations occur more frequently while using a low FiO2 for airway fire precautions.

The surgeon usually works around the ETT by displacing it anteriorly and posteriorly with the rigid laryngoscope.

Sometimes, the surgeon will repeatedly extubate the patient.

Inform the surgeon when the SaO2 < 90%.

If the FIO2 is 0.3 (30%), quickly returning the SaO2 to normal may become more difficult.

You will probably have to aggressively manually ventilate and keep the patient deep at the same time.

**Possible complications:**

\- Damage to lips, tongue, teeth and other surrounding structures.

\- Damage to cervical spine due to the Boyce position.

\- Manipulation of the larynx can cause vagal stimulation.

\- Post Operative Airway Edema

\- You should have various size ETTs available.

**Extra Notes:**

**Endotracheal Tubes and Practices to Reduce Airway Fires**

**A metal or laser ETT:**

The armored ETT that does not kink is also called “Stainless Steel.”

These are well-documented as fire-resistant.

**Laser Resistant Endotracheal Tubes:** (Laser ETT)

\- Used for intubation during laser surgery to protect the operating field from the risks of medical lasers.

\- While no ETT is entirely laser safe, these laser ETTs are made from materials like metal that are less likely to catch fire.

**Advantages of a Laser:**

It ensures hemostasis, and the surgeon can adjust beam size with a microspot.

**Double-cuffed ETT:**

If the laser beam strikes the upper cuff, some laser ETTs have a double cuff to maintain the tracheal seal.

**Fill the cuff with saline or mixed Methylene Blue:**

\- This provides a fluid to extinguish a fire should the laser come into contact with the cuff.

\- Sometimes, methylene blue (rather than air) is injected through the pilot balloon line to fill the ETT cuff.

\- Methylene Blue provides a noticeable blue color in the airway if the cuff is ruptured.

**When you only have a PVC ETT.**

\- PVC ETTs are very flammable and should be avoided.

\- **Wrap the ETT with aluminum foil** (very rare and old school).

\- This is very well documented and is sometimes practiced only when you have a PVC ETT.

\- Saline-soaked pledgets protect PVC endotracheal tube cuffs from CO2 lasers.

\- Avoid any ETT with PVC UNLESS you wrap it with aluminum foil.

\- This is not FDA-approved, but it is well-documented that it’s fire-resistant.

**Glossopharyngeal Nerve:**

The Glossopharyngeal nerve provides sensory innervation to the posterior third of the tongue, the vallecula, the anterior surface of the epiglottis (lingual branch), the walls of the pharynx (pharyngeal branch), and the tonsils (tonsillar branch).

This nerve is most easily blocked where it crosses the palatoglossal arch.

**The Glossopharyngeal Nerve can be blocked using one of three methods:**

Topical spray application

Direct mucosal contact with anesthetic-soaked pledgets.

Direct infiltration by injection.

Blocking this nerve is not adequate as a solo technique to facilitate intubation, but it is highly effective in combination with other techniques.
