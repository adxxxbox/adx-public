# Albumin

Albumin is now the colloid of choice due to the black box warnings for Voluven and Hespan.

A Colloid MW: 66.5kD, smaller than Hespan and Voluven. Available as 5% and 25% solution. 5% is a 250mL bottle 25% is a 100mL bottle 5% oncotic pressure 20mmHg (isotonic). 25% oncotic pressure 70mmHg (hypertonic). No filter required

**Average Clinical Effect:** 4-6 hours, because it is smaller. Voluven, Hespan and Hextend: is 6-8 hours.

**Doses** Popular:1-2 bottles of 5% Albumin (250mL/bottle). Shock: give what is needed to restore normal blood volume. Adults: 500mL of 5%, give rapidly as tolerated. If response in 30 minutes is inadequate, give another 500mLs. If blood volume is slightly low or normal- rate is 2-4mL/min.

**Children:** IV Rate of administration is 25% to 50% of the adult rate.

**Newborns and Infants** IV 10 to 20 mL/kg of 5% albumin based on clinical response, BP, and assessment of anemia.

**Expensive:** $250 for 2 250mL bottles. Albumex 4% and 20% is similar The large protein molecule is a major contributor to Colloid oncotic pressure (COP). Albumin has been the favored colloid in neurosurgical patients as there are several reports suggesting it may have a beneficial effect on cerebral edema and ICP.

**More Albumin Facts** Heated to 60% C for at least 10 minutes to minimize the risk of transmitting hepatitis and other virally transmitted disease. Colloid of choice in neurosurgical patients as there are several reports suggesting it may have a beneficial effect on cerebral edema and ICP. Half-life of infused albumin is 16 hours. This is debated as one anesthesia article (1:1.6 \[Hartog CS et al. Anesth Analg 112: 156, 2011) states that long term colloids is a myth and colloid expansion only lasts a few hours. Main function of Albumin: Control the plasma volume with COP. 25% Albumin supplies the oncotic equivalent of approximately 5 times its volume of human plasma. It increases the circulating plasma volume by an amount approximately 3.5 times the volume infused within 15 minutes. 25G Albumin is equivalent osmotically to about 500mLs of plasma but contains only about 1/7th the Na present in the same volume of plasma. Albumin does have some helpful free radicals (reduced sulfhydriyl groups) that reduce cellular damage during inflammatory processes. Mannitol and Hespan lack those helpful antioxidants that Albumin has. Does NOT have coagulation factors or blood group antibodies. Obtained from fractionated human plasma that is nonreactive for hepatitis. Albumin binds a host of endogenous and exogenous substances, including bilirubin, calcium, edotoxin, and certain drugs (digoxin, furosemide, warfarin, several antibiotics). It has 1 or 2 added stabilizers (sodium caprylate and acetyltryptophonate) that allows storage up to 3 years.

**Adverse Effects** Bacterial contamination with the risk of post-infusion septicemia Very rare- non-septic incompatibility reactions: chills, fever, urticaria, headache and hypotension following the administration of albumin-containing preparations have been recorded.

**Indications** Symptomatic relief and supportive treatment in: Shock Burns Hypoprothrombinemia ARDS, CPB Acute liver failure Acute nephrosis Equestration of protein-rich fluids Erythrocyte resuspension Hypotension or shock during renal dialysis Hyperbilirubinemia and erythroblastosis fetalis Peritonitis

**Contraindcations** Severe anemia Cardiac failure Renal insufficiency Presence of normal or increased intravascular volume Chronic nephrosis Hypoprothrombinemic states associated with chronic cirrhosis. Malabsorption Protein-losing enteropathies Pancreatic insufficiency Undernutrition
