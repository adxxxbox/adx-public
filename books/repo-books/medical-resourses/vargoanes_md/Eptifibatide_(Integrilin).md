Eptifibatide (Integrilin)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Eptifibatide (Integrilin)

**Reversible GP IIb/IIIa Inhibitor.  
Considered an “Anti-Platelet” medication  
Reversible:** Not bound to the platelets for the platelets’ entire life-span.  
  
**Eptifibatide** is modeled after the Lys-Gly-Asp sequence of the active protein (barbourin) in the venom of the pygmy rattlesnake, _Sistrurus barbour._  
  
**Indications  
**Treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) managed medically or with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) including intracoronary stenting.  
  
**Mechanism of Action**  
Binds to the platelet surface receptors GP IIb/IIIa and prevents he receptors from binding to fibrinogen. Inhibits platelet aggregation. Conceptually, eptifibatide sits in the binding pocket between the IIb and IIIa arms of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, thus preventing the binding of fibrinogen and thrombus formation.  
  
**Note below:** on right, when the GPIIb/IIIa receptors are antagonized, they are unable to bind to fibrinogen and other platelets.

**Doses**  
Acute Coronary Syndromes: 180 mcg/kg IV bolus over 1-2 min, THEN 2 mcg/kg/min IV for up to 72 hours.  
  
**Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI):** 180 mcg/kg IV, THEN Continuous infusion 2 mcg/kg/min with another 180 mcg/kg IV bolus 10 minutes after 1st one. Continue infusion for at least 12 hours.  
  
**Renal Impairment  
**(CrCl <50 mL/min)  
ACS: 180 mcg/kg IV, THEN continuous infusion 1 mcg/kg/min.  
PCI: 180 mcg/kg IV, THEN continuous infusion 1 mcg/kg/min with another 180 mcg/kg IV bolus 10 minutes after 1st one.  
  
**INTEGRILIN should be given concomitantly with heparin dosed to achieve the following parameters:**  
During medical management: target aPTT 50 to 70 seconds  
During PCI: target ACT 200 to 300 seconds**GPIIb/IIIa receptors** These are the major platelet surface receptors for the binding of fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor. Fibrinogen binds to the GPIIb/IIIa receptors to aggregate with other platelets.  
  
**Optional Laboratory Tests** (platelet function should to be evaluated)  
VerifyNow IIb/IIIa test (platelet function assay)  
Multiplate (platelet function assay)  
PRP - Aggregation (platelet function test)  
PFA - 100/200 (platelet function assay)  
Whole blood aggregation (platelet function assay)  
Plateletworks Assay (platelet function assay)  
  
**PT/PTT:** no measurable effect when administered alone.  
**ACT:** Eptifibatide typically prolongs the ACT by 40 – 50 seconds but no linear correlation.  
  
**Other two** **GP IIb/IIIa Inhibitors:**  
Abciximab (Reopro) – irreversible.  
Tirofiban (Aggrastat) – reversible.  
  
Eptifibatide rarely associated with thrombocytopenia.  
  
**Onset:** 15 minutes after bolus.  
**Metabolism:** renal clearance 50%  
**Excretion:** Urine  
**Total body clearance** – majority excreted unchanged  
Deaminated form (metabolites detected in urine but not in plasma)  
  
**T1/2:** 2.5 hours; prolonged in renal insufficiency  
  
**Duration after termination  
**Eptifibatide has a short half-life.  
Four hours after termination of an eptifibatide infusion, platelet aggregation recovers to approximately 70% of normal with the return of normal hemostasis.  
Eptifibatide has a lower affinity for the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor.  
  
**Renal Insufficiency:  
**Approximately 50% of eptifibatide is cleared by the healthy kidney.  
Total drug clearance is decreased by 50% and epifibatide concentrations are doubled in patients with an estimated creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min.

| Minimal Time between  
last dose and block | Can it be given  
with epidural catheter in place? | When to restart Integrilin  
after catheter removal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4-8 hours  
(longer with renal impairment) | Avoid | 6 hours  
(some literature state 2 hours) |

  
**Restart medication after procedure:** 2-4 hours per some guidelines  
_According to ASRA, GBIIb/IIa drugs are contraindicated within 4 weeks after surgery.  
The patient should be neurologically monitored if administered before that time._  
  
**Remove catheter after administration:** ASRA - Unknown  
**Specific** **Antidote:** None  
**Minor bleeding:** Desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg x 1.  
**Major Bleeding:** 10 units of cryoprecipitate  
Platelets administration has been documented but is of questionable benefit.
