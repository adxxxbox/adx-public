# Proventil Aerosol Treatment

**(Proventil, Ventolin, Albuterol, Salbuterol)**

-   **Class:** : Beta 2 Adrenergic Bronchodilator
-   **Dose:** 0.5 mL of 0.5% solution (2.5 mg)
-   **Common Dose:** "Unit Dose Proventil" is the same as above.  
    **Hint:** Aerosol treatments are much more effective than an inhaler.  
    Respiratory Therapist or the Holding RN gives the treatment.  
    
-   **Anesthesia Indications:** We usually order a Proventil aerosol treatment (or inhaler) prophylactically pre-op for patients who are:  
    Currently wheezing  
    COPDer already using Proventil  
    Reactive Airway Disease (RAD) that have the potential for a bronchospasm intraoperatively.  
    Note: While in surgery, the patient will only receive an MDI treatment. Aerosol treatments are rarely given during surgery.  
    

**MOA** Activates beta2-adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle leads to the activation of adenylcyclase. That causes an increase in cyclic AMP (CAMP) which leads to a decrease in Ca in the airway smooth muscle thus broncho relaxation (dilation) Increased CAMP concentrations are also associated with the inhibition of release of mediators from mast cells in the airway.

**Common Side Effects** Just like other other beta-adrenergic agonist, Proventil can increase the HR, BP and cause some small tremors. This is usually not an issue.

**Pseudohypokalemia.** Therapeutic doses reduce the plasma potassium concentration in healthy subjects by as much as 1.5mmol/L. This can be from a transient shift of potassium from serum to skeletal muscle. However, this type of hypokalemia can vanish within seconds to minutes due to the huge capacity of skeletal muscle Na+/K+ pumps and K+ channels. .

**CONTRAINDICTIONS** Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to albuterol or any other Proventil HFA components. Hypokalemia

**PRECAUTIONS** Albuterol , as with all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with:  
Cardiovascular disorders  
Coronary insufficiency  
Cardiac Arrhythmias  
HTN
