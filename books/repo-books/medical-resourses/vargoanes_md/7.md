### Arrive to the OR Before Induction

Recheck infusion bags, ensuring they are all full (fluid restriction is minimized at this point).  
  
Transfer patient to OR table, position IV bags such that there is slack in the lines and there are no snags or tangled lines.  
  
Connect all monitors.  
  
Begin preoxygenation.  
  
Connect previously zeroed transducers.  
  
Connect all infusions.  
  
Ensure patency and adequate flow of all IV lines both before and after arms are tucked. This reduces the probability of undetected extravasation introperatively.  
  
Initiate cerebral function monitoring if applicable.  
  
Insert PA catheter.  
  
Measure and record:

-   Systolic arterial pressure
-   Heart rate
-   Central venous pressure (CVP)
-   Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP)
-   Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP)
-   Cardiac output.
