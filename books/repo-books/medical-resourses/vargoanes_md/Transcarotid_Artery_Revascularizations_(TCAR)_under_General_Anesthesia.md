| BP management | Considerations |
| --- | --- |
| **BP:** 140-160 systolic  
**Arterial line** to monitor BP  
**Vasopressors:** Small boluses as needed.  
**Heart rate:** Maintain ≥ 70 bpm.  
Anticholinergics are advised.  
If glycopyrrolate is used, administer at beginning of procedure.  
**Hypotension** must be avoided to maintain effective reversal flow.  
**Reverse flow** varies with the difference between arterial and venous BP. | Keep patient's head immobile  
Keep tubes and wires clear of the patient's head (may obscure angiogram)  
Local or MAC procedure; convert to general if not tolerated.  
Check Activated Coagulation Time (ACT) Q 30 minutes; maintain above 250 seconds.  
**Heparin:** Initial dose to be given after cutdown but before arterial puncture. |

**Monitoring:  
Neuromonitoring:** Cerebral oximetry and/or SSEP according to surgeon preference.  
Cerebral oximetry (obtain baseline from left and right hemispheres)  
Arterial line  
  
**Intra-op**  
Follow TCAR recommendations.  
**IV access:** 2 IVs  
**Anesthesia:** GETA is currently the most frequently used.  
**Heart rate:** It may be difficult to increase HR > 70 bpm when the patient is beta-blocked.  
Profound bradycardia may occur if and when the surgeon balloon dilates the carotid artery.  
Bradycardia can be prevented with the prophylactic administration of an anticholinergic.  
Expect a decrease in cerebral oximetry (SaO2) during clamping in the presence of poor collateral circulation.  
Heparin; measure ACT Q 30 minutes.  
**  
BP control:****Nicardipine (Cardene®)** infusion must be primed and inline.**Phenylephrine (Neosynephrine®) infusion** is titrated as needed.  
**Emergence:** Awake extubation with neurologic check.  
**Post-op BP** maintain systolic BP 110-140 mmHg.
