### Cardioplegia Delivery Methods Anterograde, Retrograde or Combined

**Goal:** To deliver cardioplegia to as much myocardium as possible for maximum protection.  
  
**The two coronary arteries (ostia)** lie directly above two of the three aortic valve leaflets (in the aortic sinus). This is where the coronary vessels receive their oxygenated blood during diastole with the elastic recoil of the blood against a closed aortic valve.  
  
**Coronary sinus** is a collection of veins joined together to form a large vessel that collects venous blood from the heart and drains it into the right atrium. The left ventricle drains 75% of its venous blood from into the coronary sinus. The other 25% of the LV drains to the anterior cardiac vein.  
Most of blood from the RV will drain from the anterior cardiac vein independent of coronary sinus.  
  
**Antegrade (forward):** infused into the aortic root proximal (before) the aortic cross clamp. Thus it will enter the coronary ostia just as oxygenated blood normally does.  
  
**Advantage:** Simple and predictable.  
  
**Disdavantage -** may fail to achieve myocardial protection if any of the following are present:  
Total coronary occlusion.  
Tight coronary artery stenosis.  
Incompetent aortic valve.  
It is important that there be sufficient closure of the aortic valve or the cardioplegic solution will flow through the valve below into the left ventricle.  
  
**Retrograde** (entering backwards) directly into the coronary sinus via the right atrial appendage. Already know that by perfusing retrograde, it will perfuse 75% of the LV.  
  
**Retrograde deliveryhas a big disadvantage:** the right ventricle and posterior septum may not be adequately protected.  
  
**Combined: Retrograde and Antegrade**  
Using near-continuous retrograde cardioplegia and intermittent antegrade cardioplegia, a greater volume of myocardium is protected.
