### Dermatome Level Notes

  
**_Daniel D. Moos, CRNA_**

Assessing the dermatome level after neuraxial blockade helps to determine if the block is adequate for the proposed surgical procedure.  
  
**Differential blockade plays a role in your assessment of blockade height  
**Spinal nerve roots contain several nerve fiber types and classifications. Some are more susceptible to local anesthetics than others, causing a possible unequal block.  
  
As local anesthetic spreads, you see a smaller concentration of local anesthetic at sites distal to the injection.  
  
**Local anesthetic concentration and duration of contact plays a role  
  
**Susceptibility of nerve fiber types to be blocked:  
Small myelinated fibers are more susceptible to blockade.  
Large unmyelinated fibers are less susceptible to blockade.  
Thus there is a difference between the sympathetic level, sensory level, and motor levels.
