# Lasix

**Lasix (Furosemide)**  
**Class:** Loop Diuretic.  
Not a potassium-sparing diuretic (patient will excrete K).  
Lasix-a sulfonamide diuretic.  
**Doses:**  
0.5-1mg/kg  
5-40mg-the usual range.  
20mg is commonly ordered by the surgeon.  
5mg is common just to jump start the kidneys .  
**Peds:** 0.5-2mg/kg/dose Q6-12h.  
Max: 1,000mg/day  
Old Formula: Age + BUN = mg PO  
PO dose is twice the IV dose .  
**MOA**  
Inhibition of the reabsorption (increased excretion) of Na, Cl, K, Ca, H20, and PO3 in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle.  
Increased elimination of potassium, magnesium and calcium.  
Unlike the thiazide diuretics, Lasix and other loop diuretics are still effective when the renal functions are severely limited.  
Commonly given with Mannitol with Cranis and open AAAs.  
**Indications:**  
Neuro: Decreases CSF-Crani.  
Edema associated with: CHF, cirrhosis of the liver and renal disease including nephrotic syndrome.  
HTN  
Crani to decrease ICP  
Kidney Transplants  
Open AAA-with aortic clamping.  
Renal Failure  
Hypercalcemia  
**Elimination**\-Renal  
**Half life**\-minutes  
**Hypomagnesemia**  
Present in around 40% of patients with hypokalemia and also CHF patients receiving nonpotassium sparing diuretics.  
Due to the possibility of decreases in K+ and BP.  
Patient should always be monitored.  
PO dose is twice the IV dose  
**DRUG INTERACTIONS:**  
**Ototoxicity (hearing damage)** with Aminoglycosides (gentamycin)  
or ethacrynic acid (Edecrin) - another diuretic.  
It competes with aspirin for elimination so can lead to ASA toxicity.  
May reduce excretion of lithium- causing increased lithium blood levels.  
**Adverse Affects**\- hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, ototoxicity.  
**Contraindications**  
Patients with anuria  
Hypersensitivity to Lasix  
Labs-initial CMP, then Q4-6 hours to monitor K and Mg levels.  
Usually have standing orders for decreases in potassium and magnesium levels.  
Should have a foley catheter and monitor UO/hr.
