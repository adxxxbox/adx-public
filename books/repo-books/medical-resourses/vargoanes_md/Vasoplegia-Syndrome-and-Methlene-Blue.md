### Vasoplegia Syndrome and Methylene Blue

**Vasoplegia syndrome:** A resistant hypotensive crisis (following heart surgery) resulting from a systemic inflammatory response that can cause organ dysfunction. Manifests early in the postop period.  
  
It is believed to be attributed mainly to the systemic inflammatory response from CPB, possibly nonspecific activators such as surgical trauma, blood loss or transfusion, and hypothermia.  
  
It is usually treated with high doses of vasopressin. Levophed has been documented to be ineffective.  
However, methylene blue has been documented to also be effective.  
  
Vasoplegia is seen less with off-pump procedures.  
  
**Symptoms of Vasoplegia:**  
Hypotension  
Tachycardia  
Normal or increased cardiac output  
Decreased systemic vascular resistance and low filling pressures  
Poor responsive or unresponsive to volume boluses.  
  
**Methylene Blue:** for refractory vasoplegia syndrome. It inhibits guanylate cyclase, that is believed to cause the vasodilation. It is not a vasoconstrictor.  
In detail, it blocks the GMPc system and releases the AMPc system, facilitating the norepinephrine vasoconstrictor effect. The usual dose is 2 mg/kg as an IV bolus followed by the same continuous infusion because plasma concentrations strongly decays in the first 40 minutes.  
  
There is a possible “window of opportunity” for its effectiveness.  
  
The early use of methylene blue may halt the progression of low systemic vascular resistance even in patients responsive to norepinephrine and mitigate the need for prolonged vasoconstrictor use. However, dosing regimens and protocols need to be clearly defined before widespread routine use. Whether methylene blue should be the first line of therapy in patients with vasoplegia is a matter of debate, and there is inadequate evidence to support its use as a first line drug.
