PEG Tube Placement: (Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy Tube)-Peds   

### PEG Tube Placement: (Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy Tube)-Peds

A method of placing a tube into the stomach percutaneously; aided by endoscopy.  
  
**Goal:** Be able to feed a child formula, liquids, and medicines while lowering the incidence of aspiration.  
In order to rule out obstruction in the gastric outlet and duodenum, some GI docs confirm with a direct examination per EGD before the PEG tube is opened by the circulating RN.

First an endoscope is inserted down to the stomach (EGD via mouth) and insufflates the stomach to move it closer to the abdominal wall. While the surgeon is visualizing inside the stomach via scope, a percutaneous needle is inserted into the stomach from outside the abdominal wall. A guide wire from the needle is pulled out by the endoscope and out the mouth. So now there is a long guide wire going from outside the abdomen, through the stomach, up the esophagus and out the child’s mouth. The PEG Tube is inserted via Stellinger technique from the mouth down to the stomach.  
  
PEG tube is pulled up out of the stomach through the needle opening. The top of the tube rests on the skin and the bottom part of the PEG, which is shaped like bulb, remains inside the stomach. This bulb shape anchors the tube in the stomach and prevents it from coming out

Remember, inside the stomach is visualized via endoscope.

Some surgeons verify placement by doing a mini-laparoscopy to rule out having produced a gastrocholic fistula.

**Underlying diseases:**  
Cerebral Palsey  
Metabolic Disease  
Congenital Malformations

**Anesthesia:** General/ETT  
**Muscle relaxation:** Not needed  
**Location:** In the OR and sometimes Endoscopy Lab.

**Duration:** 15-30 minutes  
**IV Access:** 22G is acceptable

**Hydration: 4:2:1 (below is just a common reference)**  
Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin - more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc/kg)  
  
**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
3rd Spacing: 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss with an open belly case.  
  
**EBV (reference)**  
**Premature:** 90-100cc/kg  
**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg  
**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg  
**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg  

**Position:** Supine with arms out or to the side.  
Head to the left and ETT and tubing positioned away from the doctors field.  
You can ask the surgeon if he wants the ETT taped left or right. It should not matter.  
**EBL:** Minimal

**A-Line** : Not needed

**Possible Complications  
**Perforated esophagus from the EGD  
Hemorrhage

After the procedure, the child will be admitted to the hospital for observation and care. The hospital stay is usually three days. This will be used to give fluids, antibiotics and pain medication, for one to two days, as the child is recovering. Feedings will be started through the PEG tube within one or two days.
