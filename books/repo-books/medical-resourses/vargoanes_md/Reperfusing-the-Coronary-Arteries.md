### Reperfusion of the Heart

This occurs when the aortic cross clamp is removed and the heart begins to beat. The native coronary arteries are now beginning to re-perfuse.  
  
The only new graft that is perfusing at this time is the LIMA. Remember the LIMA is already connected distally and emerges from the left subclavian artery.  
  
Before discontinuing bypass, cardioplegia is being flushed out of the coronary circulation by rewarmed, recirculating blood. This reperfusion time should be at least 8 minutes. This gives time to replenish the myocardial ATP stores and eliminate metabolites from the native coronary arteries at the same time.
