### Venting the Heart

The left ventricular vent line is placed through the right superior pulmonary vein. It decompresses (removes blood) from the left ventricle.  
  
Blood keeps accumulating in the left ventricle because of a direct opening of the Thebesian veins and bronchial arteries into the left ventricle. This may compromise myocardial preservation by removing cardioplegia solution and warming the myocardium.  
  
There could also be pulmonary artery and aortic root vents.  
  
Venting of the aortic root does help provide a bloodless operative field during the performance of distal coronary anastomoses.  
The selection of these cannulae depends on the vent placement the surgeon prefers and the type of cannula used.
