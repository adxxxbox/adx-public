### Cardiovascular Effects with Neuraxial Anesthesia Notes

_The level of sympathectomy is directly related to the height of the block._

As mentioned before, neuraxial blocks results in a **sympathectomy 2-6 dermatomes above the sensory block.** The profound sympathectomy (hypotension) observed in a spinal is greater than an epidural due to the speed of onset.  
**Pre-hydration  
****Fluids wide open just prior to neuraxial anesthesia.  
**Always volume load the patient with 10-20 ml/kg of crystalloid just prior to neuraxial anesthesia.  
30-60 minutes prior is less effective with crystalloids. We all know that crystalloid leaves the vascular space in that time.Unfortunately, pre-hydration is usually not enough to prevent hypotension following initiation of neuraxial anesthesia - especially a spinal on a full term pregnant woman.  
  
Sympathetic fibers arise from T1-L2  
We need to block up to dermatome T10 (umbilicus) for a laboring woman.  
We need to block even more for a C-section (T4-nipple level)._  
  
Unfortunately, it is obvious that we need to also block sympathetic fibers to block pain for a laboring woman or for a C-section!  
  
_**A change in Heart Rate (tachycardia or bradycardia)  
  
Heart Rate may be affected due to three mechanisms:  
Bainbridge reflex** : May contribute to an increased heart rate from a decrease in atrial stretch receptors from a decreased preload.  
**SA Node:** A direct effect on the SA node decreasing heart rate.  
**T1-4 cardioaccelerator fibers blocked** (during a high spinal)  
Results in bradycardia that will NOT go away with an initial dose of ephedrine.  
  
**Pharmacologic Treatment: (spinal with C-section)  
**It is common to administer 40-80mcg of Neosynephrine IV immediately after the spinal LA is injected. If the hypotension persists, a Neosynephrine drip can be started and titrate to effect.  
  
**Neuraxial anesthesia blocks Efferent autonomic transmission producing:**  
Sympathetic block  
Partial parasympathetic block.  
  
**Where the SNS and PNS fibers originate :  
SNS (Thoracolumbar):** sympathetic fibers exit the spinal cord from T1-L2.  
**PNS (Craniosacral):** fibers exit the cranial and sacral areas.  
  
**T5-L1:** The area where many nerve fibers arise and affect the vasomotor tone of the arterial and venous system (the area that we often want to block).  
  
**Sympathetic nerve fibers:** Small and myelinated and thus easier to block, so they tend to be blocked first. This is why we FIRST see a sympathetic block and HYPOTENSION prior to sensory block, which occurs before a motor block.  
  
**When PNS is partially blocked** : decreased sympathetic tone with an unopposed parasympathetic tone.  
  
**In sequence:**  
Sympathetic block resulting in peripheral vasodilation, increased skin temperature and hypotension.  
          **↓**Loss of pain and temperature sensation  
          **↓**Inability to feel sharp pain-needle prick  
          **↓**  
Loss of proprioception (unable to tell where affected limbs are)  
          **↓**Loss of touch and pressure sensation  
          **↓**Motor Paralysis  
  
**Venous System is Responsible for Hypotension**  
The venous system contains about 75% of the total blood volume while the arterial system contains about 25% of the total blood volume.  
The dilation of the venous system is predominantly responsible for the decrease in blood pressure.  
The arterial system is able to maintain much of its vascular tone.  
Total peripheral vascular resistance will decrease 15-18% in the normal patient.  
In the elderly, the systemic vascular resistance will decrease as much as 25% with a 10% decrease in cardiac output.  
The profound dilation (venous and arterial) can be disastrous with patients with severe aortic stenosis, severe mitral stenosis and ischemic hypertrophic sub-aortic stenosis.  
  
**Symptoms  
**Decreased blood pressure  
Possible decreased HR  
Decreased cardiac contractility**Bradycardia is really bad  
Bradycardia** (T1-T4 are the cardiac accelerator fibers) _Big Red Flag  
_Bradycardia may be associated with profound hypotension and a desaturation.  
  
**Treatment  
Atropine** is your first choice. Don’t waste your time with robinul.  
1-10 mcg of **epinephrine** (if associated with hypotension) or  
1-2 units of **vasopressin** \- whichever you can administer quicker.  
A large dose of your remaining ephedrine may help while you are drawing up epinephrine or vasopressin. Be prepared.  
  
**With decreased HR  
**Decreased SVR (systemic vascular resistance).  
Results in decreased right atrial filling.  
Results in decreased stimulation of the intrinsic chronotropic stretch receptors.  
Results in decreased heart rate.The resulting hypotension is different from patient to patient. Some of it could be related to co-existing diseases or conditions - hypovolemia, weight of a gravid uterus and venous return in the parturient, or a head up position.We usually keep the patient’s BP within 20% of the patient’s baseline.  
  
**Occasional cardiac arrests can be prevented**  
Some cardiac arrests are due to an unopposed vagal stimulation and low response to treatment. Always have available pressors and anticholinergics (preferably atropine) readily available at all times.  
  
**Be careful with Trendelenburg  
**Make sure the spinal is “set” prior to placing a patient in Trendelenburg or you may aggravate the situation by creating a very high spinal. 0.75% bupivacaine used in spinals for C-sections is hyperbaric. Generally, a spinal is “set” 10-15 minutes after administration. Trendelenburg is usually safe after that.  
  
**If atropine and ephedrine aren’t working  
**If profound bradycardia and hypotension persists despite treatment, it can be treated with epinephrine in doses of 5-10 mcg titrated until you achieve the desired response.
