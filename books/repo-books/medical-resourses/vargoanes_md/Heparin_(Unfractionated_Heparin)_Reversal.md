### Heparin (Unfractionated Heparin) Reversal

**Antidote:** **Protamine Sulfate**  
In anesthesia, we usually measure the degree of reversal with a bedside ACT from an Istat machine. It can also be assessed with a aPTT and/or anti factor Xa activity.  
  
No more than 50 mg of Protamine should be administered (unless to reverse large doses of heparin during heart surgery).  
Never bolus: may cause severe hypotension.  
1-1.3 mg of protamine for every 100 units of heparin administered.  
The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Assume the half-life of Protamine is about ½ hour after intravenous injection.  
  
**Check aPTT 5-15 minutes after initial dose.  
**If Heparin was subcutaneous, recheck in 2-8 hours in case of a rebound anticoagulant effect.  
  
**Other Protamine Doses:**  
CABGs: 300-400u/kg.  
Vascular: 3-10,000u.  
Thromboembolic prophylaxis: 5,000 SQ.
