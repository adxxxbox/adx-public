Anaphylaxis (Perioperative)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Anaphylaxis (Perioperative)

Recognition of anaphylaxis during anesthesia may be delayed because the key features such as hypotension and bronchospasm more commonly have a different cause.  
  
Anaphylaxis usually occurs shortly after induction, with NMBAs or antibiotics being primarily involved, but anaphylaxis may occur any time with all potentially allergenic agents  
Inform the surgeon and call for help and a code cart  
  
**Secure airway and increase O2 to 100%.  
**Evaluate the airway and intubated the patient if needed**Note:** _The airway may became rapidly edematous, making intubation more difficult._  
Turn off inhalation agent in the presence of hypotension.  
**  
Remove suspected possible antigen(s)/trigger(s):  
**Three most common triggers  
Latex-most  
Antibiotics- (penicillins, cephalosporins)Non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers  
  
**Other potential triggers:**  
IV Dyes  
Blood products  
Hypnotic agents  
Local anesthetics  
Opioids  
Colloids  
Aprotinin  
Protamine  
Chlorhexidine  
  
**Treat hypotension:  
**Place patient in **Trendelenburg position  
**Discontinue inhalation agent if hypotension is present.  
  
**Epinephrine (drug of choice in anaphylaxis):  
Note: The small 1mg vials (1:1,000) of epinephrine are easily diluted:  
**1 mg vial added to 100 ml IV bag of normal saline yields 10mcg/ml.1mg vial added to 250 ml IV bag of normal saline yields 4 mcg/ml.**Adult dosing for anaphylaxis:  
For mild to moderate hypotension:  
Epinephrine IV:** 10 to 50 mcg increments and repeat as needed**For cardiovascular collapse or cardiac arrest:  
Epinephrine IV:** 0.5 to 1 mg boluses and repeat as needed.  
Consider epinephrine infusion to maintain BP.  
  
**Epinephrine infusion dose range: 1-16mcg/min  
For a 250 ml bag (4mcg/ml)

| Dose | IV Rate |
| --- | --- |
| 1mcg/min | 15 ml/hr |
| 2mcg/min | 30 ml/hr |
| 3mcg/min | 45 ml/hr |
| 4mcg/min | 60 ml/hr |
| 5mcg/min | 75 ml/hr |
| 6mcg/min | 90 ml/hr |
| 7mcg/min | 105 ml/hr |
| 8mcg/min | 120 ml/hr |

**If the patient is refractory to epinephrine:  
Vasopressin IV:** 10 to 40 units**Norepinephrine infusion  
Glucagon IV:** 1 to 5 mg if patient received beta-blockers**Methylene Blue IV:** 10 to 50 mg has been used when refractory to epinephrine or vasopressin.  
  
**Other drugs for hypotension:  
Vasopressin IV:** Consider when there is little response to epinephrine.  
**Initial dose:** 1-2 units as needed.  
  
**Glucagon IV:** For patients who are on beta-blockers and have a poor response to epinephrine.  
**Dose:** 1-5 mg  
  
**Methylene blue:** When anaphylaxis-induced hypotension is resistant to epinephrine and vasopressin.  
**Dose:** 10-50 mg IV  
**Increase circulating fluid volume:  
**Increase IV access if needed  
Patients may require several liters of crystalloids, if not contraindicated.Foley insertion  
  
**Presence of bronchospasm:  
**The epinephrine for hypotension usually relieves bronchospasm.  
Albuterol: >10 puffs or 2.5mg albuterol per aerosol device via ETT/inspiratory limb.  
Increase sevoflurane if the patient is normotensive.  
**Administer H 1 and H 2 histamine antagonists:  
Diphenhydramine IV:** 50 mg  
**Famotidine IV:** 20 mg**  
  
Administer corticosteroids:  
**Not helpful in acute events due to slow onset but may reduce risk of further episodes.  
  
**Dexamethasone IV:** 20 mg bolus or**Methylprednisolone IV:** 100 mg bolus or  
**Hydrocortisone:** 100-200 mg IV  
  
**Monitoring:**  
Consider arterial line if a continuous infusion of pressor is used  
TEE  
Urinary catheter  
  
**Draw a mast cell tryptase level within 2 hours.**  
**Check mast cell serum tryptase level** (requires special handling; consult lab personnel).  
Repeat Q4h and at 18-24 hours post reaction.  
**Note:** Serum levels greater than or equal to 11.5 ng/ml may indicate mast cell activation occurring as a result of anaphylaxis or allergen challenge.  
It may also indicate an increased number of mast cells as seen in patients with mastocytosis.  
  
Referral to allergist for skin testing  
**Skin test:** 4-6 weeks after reaction  
  
**Possible complication:**  
Difficult airway from swelling  
ARDS  
Hypertension and tachycardia from epinephrine  
Renal failure  
Anoxic brain injury  
Cardiac arrest  
Death**Pediatric doses of epinephrine:  
Note:** 0.01 mg = 10 mcg**Early phase without profound hypotension, shock or cardiac arrest or without IV/IO:**  
**Epinephrine IM:** 10 mcg/kg in lateral thigh Q5-15 minutes: maximum 300 mcg per dose.The site may be gently massaged to facilitate absorption.  
This may be repeated every 5-15 min. as needed if symptoms persist.**Epinephrine IV** 1-10 mcg/kg as needed  
**  
Profound hypotension or shock (with working IV/IO):**  
0.5 to1 mcg/kg and increase rapidly up to 10 mcg/kg as needed (max 1,000 mcg).  
**Epinephrine infusion:** 0.02 to 0.2 mcg/kg/min may be required to maintain BP.  
  
**For cardiac collapse or arrest:** 10 mcg/kg and repeat every 3 to 5 minutes.  
  
**Pediatric dosing for IM epinephrine:**  
_**Using**_ a regular syringe is _0.01 mg_/_kg_ of a _1:1,000_ solution (_0.01_ml/kg).  
The site may be gently massaged to facilitate absorption.  
This may be repeated every 5-15 min. as needed if symptoms persist.  
  
**Expand circulating volume:** 10-30 mL/kg  
  
**Presence of bronchospasm:** MDI or aerosol treatment with beta agonist e.g., albuterol (Proventil®) 4 to 10 puffs as needed.  
Sevoflurane may be used if the patient is normotensive.  
  
**Administer H1 and H2 histamine antagonists:  
Diphenhydramine IV:** 1 mg/kg up to 50 mg  
**Famotidine IV:** 0.25 mg/kg  
  
**Administer corticosteroids:**  
**Methylprednisolone IV:** 1 to 2 mg/kg or  
**Dexamethasone IV:** 0.2 mg/kg  
  
Consider arterial line when there is a continuous infusion of a pressor.  
  
Draw a **mast cell tryptase** level within 2 hours.  
  
**Possible complications of anaphylaxis:**  
Hypoxemia  
Difficult airway due to swelling  
ARDS  
Hypertension and tachycardia resulting from epinephrine  
DIC  
Renal failure  
Cardiac arrest  
Death
