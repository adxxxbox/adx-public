Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy are at increased risks for:

-   Anesthesia induced rhabdomyolysis (AIR) - appears similar to MH
-   Fever
-   Hyperkalemia

Differentiation between AIR and MH may be difficult, especially if the patient is not known to have DMD. Inhalational anesthetic agents have been implicated as a cause of acute rhabdomyolysis that can resemble malignant hyperthermia (MH).  
It is unknown why a small minority of these patients suffers with AIR after exposure to inhalational anesthetic agents. It is also documented that the administration of succinylcholine alone can trigger AIR.

**For anesthesia management these patients have some similarities to MH precautions.**

**Anesthesia Plan  
**

1.  Make your anesthesia machine “Trigger Free.” Managing these patients has some similarities to MH Precautions. Flush the anesthesia machine preoperatively for at least 20 minutes at 10 L/min and change the soda lime.  
    **Avoid other triggers that may cause a myotonic reaction:**  
    Hypothermia  
    Shivering  
    Mechanical or electrical stimulation

2.  Avoid Succinylcholine and volatile agents. Consider taping your vaporizers as a reminder. These patients have a normal response to NDMRs, but we still try to avoid or minimize.

3.  TIVA or regional anesthesia is strongly preferred.

4.  Consider an A-line for ABGs and lab draws perioperatively – in case you need to compare baseline K+ or creatinine kinase levels.

5.  Some literature states to consider a central line for CVP monitoring since these patients are also at risk for CHF. This is rarely done.

6.  Have NaHCO3, insulin, mannitol and CaCl available. You need to be prepared to treat AIR or hyperkalemia ASAP.

7.  Insert an OGT or NGT to decompress the stomach.

8.  Monitor urine output closely to assess volume status. Observe for dark, cola-colored urine during and post procedure. Hydrate well but be aware of CHF risks.

9.  Minimize narcotics. MD patients can be very sensitive to anesthetic agents, with hypersomnolence and CO2 retention.

10.  Carefully position the patients to prevent nerve injuries.

11.  Reserve an ICU bed for overnight observation with BiPAP available.

**Cardiac Issues  
**Dilated cardiomyopathy occurs in over 50% of patients by 15 years of age and a major cause of death. The myocardium and Purkinje system can be affected, and lead to cardiomyopathy and AV block/arrhythmia.

Cardiac muscle degeneration is usually present, including mitral regurgitation or prolapse due to papillary muscle dysfunction and decreased contractility. Cardiac reserve and conduction abnormalities should be evaluated via cardiac consult.

**Respiratory Issues**

-   These patients (especially if wheelchair bound) may have decreased cough and respiratory muscle weakness. This may lead to a decreased pulmonary reserve & accumulation of secretions
-   Postop pulmonary dysfunction with increased secretions can last up to 36 hours post-op even though strength appears equal to pre op baseline
-   PFTs may show restrictive lung disease
-   This is why BiPAP is commonly used postoperatively for many DMD patients
-   30% of the cause of deaths is respiratory related-pneumonia and CHF

**GI Issues  
**· Gastric atony, GI hypomotility and pharyngeal muscle weakness, may increase the risk for aspiration.  
  
· Post op-an MD will initiate bowel regimens to avoid and treat constipation.

**Pre-op Evaluation:  
PFT results** \- especially vital capacity (VC).  
A VC < 50% of predicted, post op ventilation may be required.  
A VC < 30% of predicted, may lead to serious complications and mechanical ventilation.  
Baseline SaO2  
**  
EKG-check for:**  
V1 having tall R waves  
Limb leads with deep Q waves  
Decreased PR intervals  
Sinus Tachycardia

**Baseline lab values:  
**ABGs  
Creatinine Kinase  
Electrolytes  
**  
Urinalysis:  
**To check if urine is positive for myoglobin.**AIR versus MH**  
  
**AIR** :  
Acute hyperkalemic cardiac arrest or  
Isolated rhabdomyolysis with no signs of systemic hypermetabolism

**MH:  
**Rapidly rising ETCO2  
Unexplained metabolic acidosis  
Inappropriate tachycardia or tachypnea in a spontaneously breathing patient  
Muscle rigidity  
Increasing body temperature >38.8°C
