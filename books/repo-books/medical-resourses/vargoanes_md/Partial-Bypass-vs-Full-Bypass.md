### Partial Bypass vs Full Bypass

**Full Bypass:** When all the venous blood is delivered through the venous cannula to the bypass machine.  
  
**Partial Bypass:** When some venous blood returns to the patient’s heart naturally through the inferior and superior venal cava while the remaining blood is going through the bypass machine. The heart is still beating and ejecting blood, just not all of it.
