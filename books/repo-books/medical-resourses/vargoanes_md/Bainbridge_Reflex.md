### Bainbridge Reflex

Also referred to as the atrial reflex.The Bainbridge reflex is a compensatory reflex resulting in an increase in heart rate following an increase in blood volume within the heart.  
Increased blood volume is detected by stretch receptors (also referred to as mechanoreceptors) located in both atria at the veno-atrial junctions.  
Mechanoreceptors sense the increased stretch, which causes a decreased parasympathetic activity to the SA node.  
This results in an increased heart rate, but NOT contractility.  
Its function is to work in conjunction with several other cardiovascular reflexes to maintain homeostasis of the cardiovascular system.  
  
**Discovery:**  
A scientist Sir Arthur Bainbridge reported this reflex in 1915 when he was experimenting on dogs.  
He found that the injection of 200 to 400 cc of saline infusion into the circulation for 1.5 to 4 minutes would result in an immediate increase in heart rate.  
However, despite the reflex found in dogs, some studies show that the Bainbridge reflex may be less prominent in man compared to the dog.  
  
**The Bainbridge reflex vs. the baroreceptor reflex**  
Both reflexes act antagonistically to control heart rate.  
**Increase in blood volume:** Bainbridge reflex is dominant.  
**Decrease in blood volume:** Baroreceptor reflex is dominant.  
  
**Examples of the** **Bainbridge Reflex**  
**Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia:** During inhalation, the intrathoracic pressure decreases, and venous return increases.  
The atrial stretch receptors increase the heart rate momentarily during inspiration.  
  
**After delivery:** The uteroplacental blood consist of up to 800 mL of blood.  
After delivery, uteroplacental blood returns into the mother's circulation and results in tachycardia.  
  
**During strenuous exercise:** It protects against excessive pressure levels in the veins, atria, and pulmonary circulation.

| **Stimuli** | ↑venous return (preload) → ↑volume in the heart |
| --- | --- |
| **Stretch receptors** | Right atrium, the superior vena cava and inferior vena cava and pulmonary veins. |
| **Afferent nerves** | **Vagus nerve** (cranial nerve X) |
| **Cardiovascular Center** | **Medulla oblongata** |
| **Efferent nerves** | **Vagus nerve** (cranial nerve X) |
| **Response** | Stretch receptors stimulates both an increase in heart rate and a decrease in vasopressin.  
↓ Parasympathetic-vagus →  
↓ ACh release →  
Heart SA node →  
↑ HR |
| **Notes** | Also, posterior pituitary gland secretes less vasopressin (ADH) resulting in  
an increase in the volume of urine excreted, serving to lower BP.  
Atrial natriuretic peptide is increased, which also promoted dieresis. |
