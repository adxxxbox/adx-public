**Advantages of Spinals**  
Easy to perform  
Reliable  
Less costly than general anesthesia  
Normal gastrointestinal function returns faster with spinal anesthesia compared to general anesthesia  
Patient maintains a patent airway  
A decrease in pulmonary complications compared to general anesthesia  
Decreased incidence of DVTs and PE formation as compared to general anesthesia.  
The appearance of CSF gives a definite end point for administration  
Can be a very quick procedure  
Requires less of a dose of local anesthetic or narcotic  
Provides a very dense sensory and motor block  
It is an excellent technique to use in the elderly patient that may not tolerate a general anesthetic**  
  
Disadvantages of Spinal Anesthesia**  
Risk of failure even in skilled hands  
Normal alteration in the patient’s hemodynamics.  
Can’t re-dose during surgery if the operation outlast the duration of the spinal**  
  
Spinals and Fast Onset**  
Spinals have a very fast onset because the nerves in the subarachnoid space lack a sheath, so the local anesthetics are able to reach their targets more readily as compared to regional blocks elsewhere in the body.
