Endometrial Ablation     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Endometrial Ablation

The surgical destruction of the lining of the uterus (endometrium). The surgeon usually  utilizes a hysteroscope or resectoscope per vaginal route for this procedure.  
A high-frequency electrical current is delivered through a resectoscope, which has been replacing the laser.

**Anesthetic:** General/LMA or ETT.  
Spinal: rare, but acceptable.  
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes  
**Position:** Lithotomy with arms out, slight Trendelenburg.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
  
**Possible Complications:**  
Perforation of the uterus  
Hemorrhage

**More Notes**  
Endometrial Ablation is not sufficient for treatment of bleeding due to uterine cancer since cancer cells may have grown into the deeper tissues of the uterus and would not be removed by the procedure.

  
**This procedure is only performed on a NON-pregnant woman who does not plan to become pregnant in the future. Labs should include a urine HCG.**  
  
This should NOT be performed if the woman has an active infection of the genital tract.  
  
Endometrial ablation is not a first-line therapy for heavy bleeding. It should only be considered when medical and hormonal therapies have not been sufficient to control the bleeding.
