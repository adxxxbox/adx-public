### Retrobulbar Block Complications

**Allergic reactions:** Usually occur with ester-type local anesthetics.

**Retrobulbar hemorrhage:** The most common complication. This can cause central retinal artery occlusion and stimulation of the oculocardiac reflex. If it occurs, the surgery is usually postponed. 

**Subconjunctival edema (chemosis)**: This can be minimized by slowing the rate of local injection. It can interfere with suturing.

**Penetration or perforation**: Through one side of the globe and out the other. It is more likely to occur in a myopic eye, which is longer, but also thinner than normal. This is painful and can cause hypotonic or a poor red reflex.  
  
**Brainstem Anesthesia:** Direct injection into the dural cuff near the optic nerve or retrograde arterial spread. This can cause cardiac arrest. Intubate, resuscitate, evacuate. The next time you work in the eye center, find out where the Defibrillator on the code cart is. Check on its pacing capability. You can work a lifetime in anesthesia and never see one of these cases, but stories abound in the field. Most are probably true.

**Oculocardiac reflex**: Bradycardia, which can follow traction on the eye. The oculocardiac reflex can also occur several hours later if it is secondary to an expanding hemorrhage. Therefore, patients with hemorrhage should be closely monitored. Us old timers call this the **_5 and dime reflex_**, because when you see it you won’t forget it. I personally have seen a heart’s rate drop from 76 to 20 within 4 beats. Which is why the first drug I draw up whenever I am in the Eye Center is always Robinul and then Atropine. Even today.

**Optic nerve atrophy**: Caused by direct damage to the optic nerve, secondary to injection into the optic nerve sheath or hemorrhage within the nerve sheath. Symptoms include partial or complete visual loss.

**Postoperative strabismus**: May be caused by an intramuscular injection of anesthetic.
