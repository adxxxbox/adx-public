| Drug Name | Infant Impact | Major Maternal Side Effects | Compatible with Breastfeeding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bupivacaine | Possible CNS depression with high maternal serum levels | Decreased Maternal blood pressure | Yes, per American Academy of Pediatrics (2001) |
| Cocaine | Irritability, seizure risk, and CNS tremors | Seizure risk and cardiac arrhythmias | Unsafe, per Epocrates, Briggs, Freeman, & Jaffe (2005). |
| Fentanyl (Sublimaze) | Dose dependent; possible respiratory depression at high levels | Respiratory depression, nausea, and vomiting | Yes, safe for breastfeeding |
| Halothane | Limited human data; animal data suggest low risk | For GA | Yes, according to AAP (2001) |
| Isoflurane | No human data | For GA | Yes, per AAP (2001); probably safer than halothane |
| Ketamine | Limited human data; animal data suggest low risk | Emergence Delirium | Probably safe |
| Lidocaine | Possible CNS depression with high maternal serum levels | Toxicity at high doses | Yes, per AAP (2001) |
| Midazolam (versed) | "floppy infant syndrome" (e.g., mild sedation, hypotonia, reluctance to suck, cyanosis, and decreased responses to cold stress) \*\* | Sedation | Unknown, may be of concern |
| Morphine (Duramorph) | Apnea and bradycardia with repeated maternal doses (dose dependent) | Respiratory depression at higher doses, nausea, and vomiting | Yes (in single dose); probable safe for breastfeeding |
| Nitrous Oxide | Unknown or no clinical effects | Nausea | OK during a C-section, unlikely that infant will be exposed to significant extent |
| Propofol | Limited human data | Respiratory depression and hypotension | Probably safe |
| Remifentanil (Ultiva) | Unknown | Respiratory depression, nausea, and vomiting | Probably safe or safety unknown |
| Rocuronium (Zemuron) | Unknown | Muscle weakness and respiratory depression | Probably yes |
