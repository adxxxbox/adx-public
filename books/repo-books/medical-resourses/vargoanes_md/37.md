### Transport to ICU and Handoff

Ensure the presence of experienced help for transfer. Particular attention should be paid to the transport of IV poles with volumetric pumps. Ensure that adequate “slack” is present in the infusion and monitoring tubing to avoid dislodging lines.  
  
Monitor hemodynamic status vigilantly while transporting. Be prepared to adjust infusions or administer vasoactive boluses while en route to the post-op area.  
  
On arrival at the post-op unit, ensure that a care team is awaiting the patient’s arrival. Follow institutional procedures for transferring monitoring equipment to the receiving unit’s monitors. Ensure that appropriate personnel are present to assume the responsibility for post-op mechanical ventilation. Ensure that breath sounds indicate good bilateral air entry. Give a handoff report and summary according to institutional standards. Remain at the bedside until the patient is stable and all questions have been answered for the receiving care team and that sufficient information has been imparted that this team can assume full care of the patient.
