### Pars Plana Vitrectomy, or PPV

A surgical procedure that involves removal of vitreous gel from the eye via a closed system. This is appropriate whenever access to the posterior segment of the eye is necessary for treatment.

**What is a Pars Plana****?**  
It is part of the uvea, choroidea, one of the three layers that comprise the eye. As a part of the ciliary body, it is about 4 mm long and located near the point where the iris and sclera touch. It is the access site where surgeon can enter the posterior chamber for the procedure.

**Anesthetic:** Usually MAC with a Retrobulbar block.  
Usually 2mg of Versed pre-op and Alfenta or Propofol just prior to the retrobulbar block. Don’t over sedate the patient because snoring is magnified through the microscope.  
**Duration:** 30-90 minutes.  
**IV Access**: 22G is acceptable. A 500mL NS bag with micro drip tubing is popular.  
Many of these patients are diabetic and very hypertensive.  
**Position:** Supine with arms tucked and the patient remains on the same stretcher. Make sure the ETCO2 NC is looped away from the surgical eye. The stretcher is parked 90-180 degrees away from you (unless you are starting out as a general).  
**EBL:** Minimal

Be careful giving Toradol. Some Vitrectomies are hemorrhage related. Many of these patients are diabetic and very hypertensive.
