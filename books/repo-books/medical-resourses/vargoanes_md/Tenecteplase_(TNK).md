### Tenecteplase (TNK)

Also known as TNKase.  
  
**Quick notes and facts:  
**\- TNK is a genetically modified form of tPA that binds to fibrin and converts plasminogen to plasmin.\- TNK has a higher fibrin specificity than alteplase.  
\- It is produced by recombinant DNA technology using an established mammalian cell line from the Chinese Hamster ovary cells.  
\- TNK has an increased resistance to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 inactivation.  
\- It has a longer half-life than alteplase.  
\- TNK offers a quick bolus delivery system.  
  
**Indications:  
**\- To reduce the risk of death associated with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).  
\- It is now increasingly being used for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) caused by intracranial large vessel occlusions (LVOS) that are eligible for intracranial thrombectomy (code stroke).  
**TNK Dosing:** Delivered as a 5-second IV bolus

**TNK (TNKase) is supplied in a ready-to-use kit that includes:  
**\- One 50-mg vial of sterile, lyophilized TNKase powder  
\- Sterile, graduated, disposable BD ® 10-mL syringe with TwinPak™ Dual Cannula Device  
\- 10-mL vial of Sterile Water  
\- TNKase complete prescribing information  
\- Mix with 10 mLs of sterile water (5 mg/mL)  
  
**Contraindications for AMI:  
TNK therapy in patients with AMI is contraindicated in the following situations because of an increased risk of bleeding:  
**\- Active internal bleeding  
\- History of cerebrovascular accident  
\- Intracranial or intraspinal surgery or trauma within two months  
\- Intracranial neoplasm  
\- Arteriovenous malformation or aneurysm  
\- Known bleeding diathesis  
\- Severe uncontrolled hypertension  
**Tenecteplase (TNK) vs Alteplase:  
**\- TNK has a longer half-life (22 minutes vs. 4 minutes for alteplase)\- TNK can be administered as a single bolus, a significant practical advantage, particularly for patients who require transportation to another center.  
\- TNK has a 15-fold higher specificity for fibrin and an 80-fold decreased binding affinity to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1).  
\- Although intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase remains the primary treatment for acute ischemic stroke, tenecteplase has shown potential advantages over alteplase.  
\- Tenecteplase has been suggested to improve recanalization and reperfusion without increasing the risk of bleeding and may lyse large vessel clots more effectively.  
  
**TNK and cerebral hemorrhage:**  
TNK studies were associated with a lower risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage compared to thrombolysis with alteplase in patients with and without mechanical thrombectomy following thrombolytic therapy.  
  
**Pharmacokinetics:**  
\- In patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), TNK administered as a single bolus exhibits a biphasic disposition from the plasma.  
\- TNK is cleared from the plasma with an initial half-life of 20 to 24 minutes.  
**The terminal phase half-life:** 90 to 130 minutes.  
\- In 99 of 104 patients treated with TNK.  
\- Mean plasma clearance ranged from 99 to 119 mL/min.  
\- The initial volume of distribution is weight-related and approximates plasma volume.  
\- Liver metabolism is the major clearance mechanism for TNK.  
  
**Warnings: Bleeding**  
\- The most common complication encountered during TNK therapy is bleeding.  
\- The type of bleeding associated with thrombolytic therapy can be divided into two broad categories:  
\- **Internal bleeding involving** intracranial and retroperitoneal sites or the gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or respiratory tracts.  
\- **Superficial or surface bleeding** is observed mainly at vascular punctures and access sites (e.g., venous cutdowns, arterial punctures) or sites of recent surgical intervention.  
\- Should severe bleeding (not controlled by local pressure) occur, any concomitant heparin or antiplatelet agents should be discontinued immediately.  
  
Each patient being considered for therapy with TNK should be carefully evaluated, and anticipated benefits should be weighed against potential risks associated with treatment.  
**  
In the following conditions, the risk of TNK therapy may be increased and should be weighed against the anticipated benefits:  
**\- Recent major surgery, e.g., coronary artery bypass graft, obstetrical delivery, organ biopsy, previous puncture of noncompressible vessels  
\- Cerebrovascular disease  
\- Recent gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding Recent trauma  
\- Hypertension: systolic BP ³ 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP ³ 110 mm Hg  
\- High likelihood of left heart thrombus, e.g., mitral stenosis with atrial fibrillation  
\- Acute pericarditis  
\- Subacute bacterial endocarditis  
\- Hemostatic defects, including those secondary to severe hepatic or renal disease  
\- Severe hepatic dysfunction  
\- Pregnancy  
\- Diabetic hemorrhagic retinopathy or other hemorrhagic ophthalmic conditions  
\- Septic thrombophlebitis or occluded AV cannula at the infected site  
\- Advanced age  
\- Patients currently receiving oral anticoagulants, e.g., warfarin sodium  
\- Recent administration of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors  
\- Any other condition in which bleeding constitutes a significant hazard or would be particularly difficult to manage because of its location  
  
**Warnings and Precautions  
Bleeding:  
**\- TNKase can cause bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage and fatal bleeding.  
\- Concomitant use of other drugs that impair hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding.\- Should severe bleeding that is not controlled by local pressure occur, discontinue any concomitant heparin or antiplatelet agents immediately and treat appropriately.  
\- Avoid intramuscular injections and nonessential handling of the patient for the first few hours following treatment with TNKase.  
\- Perform arterial and venous punctures carefully and only as required.  
\- To minimize bleeding from noncompressible sites, avoid internal jugular and subclavian venous punctures.  
\- If an arterial puncture is necessary during TNKase infusion, use an upper extremity vessel that is accessible to manual compression.  
\- Apply pressure for at least 30 minutes.  
**  
Thromboembolism:  
**The use of thrombolytics can increase the risk of thrombo-embolic events in patients with a high likelihood of left heart thrombi, such as patients with mitral stenosis or atrial fibrillation.  
**  
Cholesterol Embolization:  
**Cholesterol embolism has been reported in patients treated with thrombolytic agents.  
Investigate the cause of any new embolic event and treat it appropriately.  
**  
Arrhythmias:  
**Coronary thrombolysis may result in arrhythmias associated with reperfusion. When TNKase is administered, anti-arrhythmic therapy for bradycardia and/or ventricular irritability should be available.  
**  
Increased Risk of Heart Failure and Recurrent Ischemia when used with Planned Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) in STEMI  
Hypersensitivity reports after TKA administration:  
**Urticarial  
Anaphylactic reactions  
Angioedema  
Laryngeal edema,  
Rash  
  
If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, initiate appropriate therapy (e.g., antihistamines, corticosteroids).  
  
**Adverse Reactions:  
**The most frequent adverse reactions associated with TNKase are bleeding and hypersensitivity.  
**  
**Pregnancy (Category C):****  
TNKase has been shown to elicit maternal and embryotoxicity in rabbits given multiple IV administrations.  
  
**Nursing Mothers:** It is not known if TNK is excreted in human milk.  
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when TNKase is administered to a nursing woman.  
**Pediatric Use** The safety and effectiveness of TNKase in pediatric patients have not been established.  
  
**Geriatric patients have a higher risk for bleeding:**  
\- The 30-day mortality rates by age were 2.5% in patients under the age of 65, 8.5% in patients between the ages of 65 and 74, and 16.2% of patients aged 75 and over.  
\- The intracranial hemorrhage rates were 0.4% in patients under the age of 65, 1.6% in patients between the ages of 65 and 74, and 1.7% in patients aged 75 and over.
