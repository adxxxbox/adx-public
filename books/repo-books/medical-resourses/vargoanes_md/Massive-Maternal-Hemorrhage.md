Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH) Checklist    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH) Checklist

Activate **massive transfusion protocol** (usually after 1,500 ml EBL)  
Call for more anesthesia and other trained staff.  
Change blood pressure intervals to every minute until arterial line insertion.  
Identify the cause.**Infuse volume rapidly:** Crystalloid or colloids wide open.  
Use pressure bags if possible.  
Use an emergency management plan with checklists according to etiology.  
Immediately administer uterotonics discussed below.  
**  
Uterotonic agents include:**  
Oxytocin  
  
**Ergot** **alkaloids:** Methylergonovine (Methergine®) and prostaglandin F2a (Hemabate®)  
**Prostaglandins:** Misoprostol (Cytotec®) and dinoprostone  
  
**Immediate medications to consider for postpartum hemorrhage** table.tableizer-table { font-size: 12px; border: 1px solid #CCC; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; } .tableizer-table td { padding: 4px; margin: 3px; border: 1px solid #CCC; } .tableizer-table th { background-color: #104E8B; color: #FFF; font-weight: bold; }

| Drug | Dosing |
| --- | --- |
| **Pitocin**  
(oxytocin) | First line agent  
10 to 40 units in a 500 to 1,000 mL NS infusion or  
10 units IM |
| **Tranexamic Acid:**  
(Cyklokapron®) | 1 gram IV over 10 minutes (add to 100ml NS) may give a  
2nd 1 gram dose 30 minutes after the last dose. |
| **Methergine®  
**(Methylergonovine) | 0.2 mg IM every 2 to 4 hours |
| **Hemabate®**  
(Carboprost) | 0.25 mg IM every 15 to 90 minutes up to 8 doses or  
500 mcg IM incrementally up to 3 mg or  
0.5 mg intramyometrial |
| **Cytotec®**  
(misoprostol)  
A prostaglandin E1 analogue | Use only when oxytocin is not available.  
600 mcg to 1 mg rectally  
800 mcg oral or sublingual  
Equivalent to 40 IU of IV oxytocin in women who  
have received oxytocin for the prevention of PPH in the 3rd stage of labor.  
Contraindicated in asthmatics |
| **Dinoprostone**  
(prostaglandin E2) | 20 mg vaginally or rectally  
Rarely readily available. |
| **Recombinant human factor VIIa**  
(rFVIIa)  
NovoSeven® | 50 to 100 mcc/kg Q2 hours  
has been effectively used "off label" on an empirical basis in the treatment  
of massive PPH which did not respond to conventional method  
Rarely readily available. |

**Start large bore IVs and simultaneously draw labs.  
**Insert one to two large bore IVs.  
An EJ, central-line and CVP are optional in severe cases when extra personnel are available.**  
Stat labs:  
**CBCFibrinogen  
Fibrin degradation products  
Type and crossmatch (Ascertain whether a sample has previously been drawn).  
PT and aPTT (coags)  
TEG if available  
Insert arterial lineSupport blood pressure with vasopressors.  
Transfuse RBCS, platelets, cryoprecipitate, and FFP using massive transfusion protocol.  
  
**_Note:_** _If massive transfusion is required in the presence of inadequate staff, consider asking the circulator to request the institution’s “rapid response team” (RRT).  
RRT members are experts at venous access, rapid transfusion, and resuscitation._  
  
**Administer blood, platelets and FFP** (O negative if necessary).Hospitals are now starting to assemble **trauma packs** for these clinical scenarios.  
These packs usually contain 4 units PRBCs (un-crossmatched), 10 pack of platelets and 4 of FFP.  
Administer blood and factors as needed.  
  
**Consider converting to general anesthesia** (depending on severity)**General/ETT:** RSI  
**Induction:** ketamine 1-1.5mg/kg  
Etomidate (Amidate®) may be preferable to ketamine.  
**Phenylephrine infusion:** Yes**Ephedrine:** Have a syringe ready.**A-line:** Yes  
**Fluid Warmer:** Yes, with blood tubing  
**Forced Air Body Warmer:** Yes**  
Increasing the ratio of FFP to RBCs improves survival.  
**Conventional fluid resuscitation enhances dilutional coagulopathy and fibrinolysis and contributes to acidemia and hypothermia.  
_Evidence-based recommendations advise higher FFP to RBC ratios to improve outcome._  
  
Recent advances from trauma medicine suggest that increasing the ratio of FFP to RBCs from 1:3 and 1:4 to 1:1 or 1:2 improves survival.  
Massive transfusion protocol (ACOG, 2019) recommends having a minimum of 4 units of PRBC immediately available, the capability to rapidly obtain 6 further units of PRBC and 4 units FFP (compatible or type specific), and a mechanism to obtain other blood products quickly.  
_Tranexamic Acid (TXA) and fibrinogen concentrate is now recommended for PPH.  
_1 gram of TXA IV; may repeat in 30 minutes.**Postpartum hemorrhage lab values prompting transfusion** table.tableizer-table { font-size: 12px; border: 1px solid #CCC; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; } .tableizer-table td { padding: 4px; margin: 3px; border: 1px solid #CCC; } .tableizer-table th { background-color: #104E8B; color: #FFF; font-weight: bold; }

| Blood product | Lab values

effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PRBCs  
30-45 mins to crossmatch | Hct < 18 or  
Hct < 30 if unstable or  
active bleeding | 325 mL | Hct increases 3% per unit |
| Platelets (PLT)  
30-45 mins to thaw for release | < 50,000 or  
microvascular bleeding  
1:1 ratio with PRBCs | 50 mL | PLT count increases by  
7,500/mm3/U |
| FFP | INR > 2x normal  
1:1 ratio with PRBCs | 250 mL | Fibrinogen increases by  
10-15 mg/dL/U |
| Cryoprecipitate  
30-45 mins to thaw for release | Fibrinogen < 100 mg/dL | 40 mL | Fibrinogen increases by  
10-15 mg/dL/U |

  
  
**Administer blood, platelets and FFP:** (O negative if necessary).As discussed previously, hospitals are now starting to assemble **trauma packs** for these clinical scenarios.
