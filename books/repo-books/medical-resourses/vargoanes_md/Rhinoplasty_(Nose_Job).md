### Rhinoplasty (Nose Job)

Rhinoplasty is usually performed to enhance the appearance or reconstruct the nose. During rhinoplasty, the nasal cartilages and bones are modified, or tissue is added, to improve the appearance of the nose.  
  
Rhinoplasty is performed either using a closed procedure, where incisions are hidden inside the nose, or an open procedure, where an incision is made across the columella, the narrow strip of tissue that separates the nostrils.  
  
Through these incisions, the skin that covers the nasal bones and cartilages is gently raised, allowing access to reshape the structure of the nose.  
Splints and gauze packing are utilized to support the nose.  
  
This can be a two-stage procedure, the first stage completed under general anesthesia.  
If a second procedure is performed, it is usually done using monitored anesthesia care and sedation.  
  
**Rhinoplasty can also be used for nasal fracture**  
When rhinoplasty is used to repair nasal fractures, the goal is to restore pre-injury appearance of the nose.  
  
**Septorhinoplasty** is a related procedure performed for patients who also have nasal obstruction.  
Septorhinoplasty not only improves the appearance of the nose, but it removes any internal obstructions and stabilizes structures that may be blocking nasal breathing.  
  
**Drugs that effect coagulation must be avoided  
**Some plastic surgeons will postpone a procedure if any drugs that alter proper coagulation remain in the patient’s circulation.  
  
Aspirin, or any product containing aspirin, should not be taken within 10 days of the date of surgery.  
  
Non-steroidal drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil®, or Motrin®), or naproxen (Naprosyn®), should not be taken within 7 days of the date of surgery.  
  
Many over-the-counter products contain aspirin or ibuprofen. Careful review of patient medications is required.  
  
Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) is an acceptable analgesic.  
  
Regardless of which type of anesthesia is selected, rhinoplasty is always performed with after injection of the tissue with local anesthetic (lidocaine mixed with epinephrine) both to directly numb the nose and to reduce the amount of bleeding encountered during surgery  
  
**Anesthesia:** General endotracheal  
  
Rhinoplasty almost always causes bleeding into the pharynx. Intubation protects the airway from contamination with blood.  
Monitored anesthesia care with sedation is not recommended.  
  
**Avoid hypertension:** The goal is to minimize bleeding but to maintain BP within 20% of the baseline BP.  
Anesthesia is titrated to limit hypertension.  
A beta blocker is useful during emergence to limit post-operative bleeding.  
  
**Antiemetic:** Required, blood in the stomach is a potent emetic.  
The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) for rhinoplasty is around 12%.  
Any major nausea and vomiting (PONV) in the immediate postoperative period may result in aspiration of gastric contents.  
  
**Antisialagogue:** Required; glycopyrrolate is recommended.  
  
**Throat pack:** used occasionally, not as commonly as previously.  
  
Airway obstruction may occur from inadvertently leaving the pack in place.  
Protocols have been designed to ensure the complete removal of surgical gauzes at the end of the operation.  
  
A beta blocker is useful during emergence to prevent or treat hypertension and limit post-operative bleeding.  
  
**Opioids:** If the surgeon topically anesthetized inside the nose with cocaine, opioids should not be required.  
**Duration:** 1-3 hours  
**Position:** Supine with HOB up 10-20 degrees, or reverse Trendelenburg.  
Table may be rotated 90 degrees. Patient’s arm will be tucked on the side where the surgeon prefers to be.  
**ELB:** minimal; 40 ml  
**OGT insertion prior to emergence:** Passing an OGT is recommended whether there is a throat pack or not.  
**Emergence:** Deep extubation is acceptable if not contraindicated.  
  
**Possible Complication  
**Infection  
Perioperative laryngospasm  
Recurrent epistaxis  
Difficulty breathing through the nose  
Permanent numbness in and around the nose  
Asymmetrical appearance of nose  
Pain, discoloration or swelling that may persist  
Scarring  
Septal perforation  
Nausea, vomiting, sore throat
