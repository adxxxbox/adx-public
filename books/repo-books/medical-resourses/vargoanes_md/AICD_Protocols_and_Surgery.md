### AICD Protocols and Surgery

Electromagnetic interference = EMI  
  
**Quick review:  
**All modern AICDs are also pacemakers.Applying a magnet on an AICD will ONLY suspend anti-tachyarrhythmia therapy and will NOT have any effect on the AICD’s pacemaker function.  
To reprogram an AICD pacemaker function from synchronous to asynchronous mode MUST be performed by a device representative. A magnet placement will not suffice.  
  
**An AICD may misinterpret the EMI as VT or SVT and deliver a shock:**  
Placing a magnet on an AICD will suspend anti-tachyarrhythmia therapy. Therefore, the AICD  
will NOT misinterpret the EMI as VT or SVT and deliver a shock. Hence the magnet’s use.  
  
**Common AICD Protocol:  
**_Always follow your institution’s protocols._  
  
**If EMI is below umbilicus?  
**Do not need to apply magnet. Have magnet on standby.Many protocols do not apply a magnet (i.e. foot surgery), but require a magnet on standby.  
Many anesthesia providers still apply magnet regardless with EMI location.  
**  
If EMI is above umbilicus:  
**Apply magnet.  
**  
If EMI is above umbilicus and patient IS pacemaker dependent?  
**Apply a magnet.  
Contact device representative to reprogram AICD pacer function to asynchronous mode.  
  
**If EMI is above umbilicus and patient IS NOT pacemaker dependent?  
**Apply magnet.  
Pacemaker function DOES NOT need to be reprogrammed to asynchronous mode.  
**More notes:** A CIED is an acronym for any Cardiovascular Implantable Electronic Device. It is a broad term that encompasses pacemakers for bradycardia, Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) for tachyarrhythmia management, and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) devices for systolic dysfunction with a conduction delay.**  
  
Most patients with CIEDs do NOT need a new preoperative evaluation by the CIED management:**  
The HRS/ASA consensus statement concludes that most patients with CIEDs do not need a new preoperative evaluation by the CIED management team (physicians and other health care professionals who monitor the who monitor the CIED function of the patient) because, most of the time, the pertinent information will be available in the notes from the CIED clinic.  
  
**  
Patients usually carry a Pacemaker or AICD card:**  
This card should give you details of the device and its manufacturer, model number, serial number, implanting hospital, follow-up hospital, date of/reason for the implant.  
If the patient can’t find the card, you can ask a family member, or get an X-ray of the device and see the make on the circuit board. Moreover, you can see the leads and tell what the device is.  
  
The easiest way to find out about the device is to call one of the manufacturers below.  
They are open 24/7/365.  
If you call and identify the patient, they may give you the needed information.  
They may also send a representative.
