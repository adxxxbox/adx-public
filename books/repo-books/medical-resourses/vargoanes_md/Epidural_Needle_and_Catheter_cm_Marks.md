### Epidural Needle and Catheter cm Marks

**_Warning:_** _Not all epidural kits come with the same cm markings. Know your markings before insertion._  
  
**Epidural needle cm markings** (graduations)  
The cm markings on the epidural needle are used to determine the depth from the skin to the epidural space.  
**Ex.** When you reach the loss or resistance (epidural space), look at the cm mark on your needle at the patient’s SKIN LEVEL. If the needle to skin is 4cm, then you know the epidural space is 4cm deep.  
Knowing that, after you insert the epidural catheter 4cm into the epidural space, you can now remove the epidural needle. While removing the epidural needle, the catheter is simultaneously advanced even more (deeper) to prevent the catheter coming out while removing the epidural needle.  
  
**Meaning -** that the catheter may be in more after it was originally inserted 4 cm in the epidural space and will need to be withdrawn to the proper cm skin reference mark that you originally calculated. So the epidural catheter cm marking at the SKIN LEVEL should be 8cm.  **Note:** You notice the 11-12cm markings on the epidural catheter below is equal in size as the epidural needle just below it.The length of the needle tip back to the hub is 11-12cm.

The depth of the epidural space is usually 4-6 cm. So look at the above markings of the epidural needle and remember it.
