### Cushing Reflex

**Also referred to as:**  
Vasopressor response  
Cushing reaction  
Cushing effect  
Cushing phenomenon  
Not to be confused with Cushing syndrome or Cushing disease.  
Cushing reflex is a protective mechanism in which there is an attempt to increase systolic BP enough to rise above the increased ICP to maintain cerebral prefusion pressure (CPP).  
  
The Cushing reflex was first identified by U.S. neurosurgeon Henry Williams Cushing.  
It was described as the presence of hypertension and bradycardia associated with increased intracranial pressure  
  
**_For the brain to remain adequately perfused, MAP must be maintained higher than ICP.  
_**Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP) = MAP- ICP  
**Cushing reflex** is a physiological nervous system response to acute elevations of intracranial pressure (ICP) or cerebral ischemia resulting in **Cushing’s triad.  
  
Cushing’s triad:  
**Widened pulse pressure (increasing systolic, decreasing diastolic)  
Bradycardia  
Irregular breathing  
  
Cushing reflex, is usually observed in the later stages of acute head injury.  
A late sign of increasing ICP, and indicative that brainstem herniation is imminent.  
**Cushing Reflex stages  
**  
**Cerebral ischemia caused by ↑ ICP****↓  
Cerebral ischemia at the medullary vasomotor center  
↓  
Stage 1: ↑ tachycardia and BP,** a response to sympathetic activation (aortic arch baroreceptors) to overcome increases in ICP to restore cerebral perfusion.**↓**  
**Stage 2:** Bradycardia from activation of the parasympathetic system (vagus nerve).  
Hypertension continues to be present, but the patient becomes **bradycardic** rather than tachycardic.  
The theory for the bradycardia is from compression of the intracranial vagal nerve.  
Blood pressure will continue to rise until the MAP overcomes the ICP so blood can adequately perfuse the brain.  
This is to avoiding infarction.  
**↓**  
**Later stage:** **Irregular breathing  
**Bradycardia or tachycardia and **irregular breathing** (initially by shallow breaths with occasional periods of apnea).  
There is brainstem dysfunction secondary to increased ICP, tachycardia, or bradycardia is observable clinically as an irregularity in breathing.  
Irregular breathing occurs due to compression/heniation of the brainstem by increased ICP, and in result, distortion of the respiratory centers.  
Eventually, agonal breathing may develop as herniation of the brain begins, with progression to respiratory and cardiac arrest.  
  
In infants: Macrocephaly, bulging fontanel, sunset sign.  
  
Due to autoregulatory mechanisms, the ICP is maintained within a normal range (5 mmHg to 15).  
Autoregulatory mechanisms can respond to such changes (so long as mean arterial pressure (MAP) remains between 50 mmHg to 150 mmHg), and maintain ICP within a normal range.  
  
**Note:  
**Chemoreceptor reflex is helpful when the BP is between 40-70 mmHg.  
However, when the BP falls below 40 mmHg, it is the central nervous system (CNS) response as the last resort.  
  
**Increased mortality with Cushing symptoms  
**Patients who present to the ER with concerns for increased ICP, when two of three signs of Cushing reflex have been found to have almost  
two-fold higher mortality than patients with normal and stable vital signs.  
It is, therefore, important to immediately recognize early signs of elevated ICP.  
**First signs of** **↑ ICP  
**HypertensionHeadache  
Nausea  
Vomiting  
Altered LOC  
Pupils that don't respond to changes in light

Treatment for Cushing Reflex (ICP management)  
Goal: Keep ICP < 20 mmHg**  
Elevate patient’s head 30 to 45 degrees.  
Avoiding neck flexion/rotation or circumstances that may provoke Valsalva responses.  
Fluid management: Patients should be euvolemic, blood hypo-osmolarity should be avoided,  
**IV Mannitol:** Can generally be administered every 6–8 hours, effects last for up to 24 hours.  
Or furosemide  
Steroids  
Cerebrospinal fluid monitoring and drainage.  
  
**Decompressive craniectomy:** Removal of part of the cranium allowing the brain to expand and reduces ICP.  
  
**Warning: The antihypertensive agents commonly used (listed below), may cross the blood-brain barrier and may also increase ICP and impair autoregulation.**  
Antihypertensive medications (listed below) are commonly administered when where all reasons of hypertension are ruled.Beta-blockers  
Ca channel blockers, NTG, Nipride and Hydralizine.
