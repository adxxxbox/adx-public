### Spinal - Easy Explanation

A spinal is simply a single shot.  
The skin on the back is numbed with lidocaine.  
An introducer needle is inserted to permit the spinal needle to bypass the skin and tissue and to serve as a guide.  
An ultra-thin (25g or 27g) spinal needle is inserted through the larger introducer  
The tip of the spinal needle penetrates the dura mater and enters the subarachnoid space  
A small dose of anesthetic and often a little narcotic is injected  
Then the needle and introducer are removed  
  
A single-shot spinal has a limited duration.  
The spinal block duration depends on the type of local anesthetic used.  
  
**The spinal block does the following:**  
Immediate pain relief  
Sensory block  
Lower blood pressure > than epidural  
  
**Spinals and Fast Onset**  
Spinals have a very fast onset because the nerves in the subarachnoid space lack a sheath, so the LAs are able to reach their targets more readily as compared to regional blocks elsewhere in the body.
