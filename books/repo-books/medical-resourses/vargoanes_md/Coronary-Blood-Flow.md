### Coronary Blood Flow

During systole, no blood flow occurs to the left ventricle, especially the subendocardium. However, perfusion of the superficial epicardial vessels does occur.  
During systole and diastole, there is blood flow to the right ventricle.  
Coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) = aortic diastolic pressure minus LVEDP. CPP = ADP – LVEDP.  
The endocardium is most vulnerable to ischemia during a decrease in CPP, because it is subjected to greatest intramural pressures.  
  
CPP is autoregulated to maintain a constant flow between perfusion pressures of 50 -120 mmHg. Beyond that range, blood flow becomes increasingly pressure-dependent.  
The resting coronary blood flow is approximately 250 ml/min and represents 5% of cardiac output.  
  
The heart has the highest oxygen consumption per tissue mass of all human organs.  
Coronary blood flow is mainly determined by local oxygen demand.  
The vascular endothelium is the final common pathway controlling vasomotor tone.  
  
**Thebesian veins** drain a small proportion of coronary blood directly into the cardiac chambers and account for true shunt.  
  
Norepinephrine (NE) vasodilates coronary vessels via beta-adrenergic receptors, but constricts most other vessels.  
  
**Agonists of alpha-receptors:** phenylephrine causes very little constriction in the coronary circulation but is more potent everywhere else. Thus a phenylephrine infusion is preferred in patients undergoing CABG.
