### Lap Chole (Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy)

Laparoscopically removing the gallbladder.

![image333](image333.png)

-   Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a standard procedure for the management of gallbladder disease.
-   The gallbladder is attached right below the liver in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen.
-   It is about 4 inches long and resembles a pear in shape.
-   The cystic duct and the cystic artery are identified, clipped with tiny titanium clips, and then cut.
-   The Gallbladder is then dissected away from the liver bed and removed through one of the laparoscopic ports.

**Indications for cholecystectomy:**

-   Acute Cholecystitis
-   Symptomatic cholelithiasis (stones)
-   Cholecystectomy is not indicated in most patients with asymptomatic stones
-   Biliary Dyskinesia
-   Gallbladder cancer
-   Gallbladder trauma
-   Pancreatitis
-   Cancer
-   Polyps over 1 cm
-   Porcelain gallbladder

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT

**Duration:** 15-60 minutes

**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable

**EBL:** Minimal

**Bed position:** Reversed, in case an Intra-Operative Cholangiogram (IOC) is needed.

**IOC:** The injection of dye into the bile duct to visualize potential issues like gallstones.

-   A C-arm is positioned above and below the patient's abdomen for this.
-   The newer operating beds do not require the bed to be manually reversed pre-operatively (rotated 180 degrees) because they have a Foot and Head sliding "Mode" to adapt to X-ray and C-arm requirements.

**Position:** Supine, with arms usually out; sometimes one is tucked, per surgeon preference.

-   You will be asked to place the bed in reverse Trendelenburg and tilt it (airplane) to the left, towards the surgeon, who is often standing on the patient's left side.
-   The reverse Trendelenburg position produces gravitational displacement of the viscera away from the surgical site, making it easier for the surgeon.
-   Make sure the patient is securely strapped because you do not want the patient sliding off the bed while positioning.
-   Check the patient's head.

**Adequate ventilator tubing slack:**

-   Before positioning the patient to reverse Trendelenburg, consider stretching out your ventilator circuit to ensure there is enough slack, as the positioning will increase the distance between the patient's head and the anesthesia machine.
-   This will avoid an inadvertent extubation.

**Decrease in blood pressure (BP) in reverse Trendelenburg:**

-   With reverse Trendelenburg, the patient's BP may drop, so make sure the patient is well hydrated.
-   You should have a syringe of diluted phenylephrine or ephedrine on standby.

**Bradycardia with Pneumoperitoneum (0.2 mg glycopyrrolate):**

-   With any laparoscopic procedure, visualization of the peritoneal cavity is assisted by a pneumoperitoneum that distends and separates the abdominal wall from its contents.
-   Unfortunately, the pneumoperitoneum increases intra-abdominal pressure.
-   The excessive stretching of the peritoneum may produce bradycardia via vagal reflex.
-   Inform the surgeon immediately, and they will deflate the abdomen while you treat the patient's bradycardia.
-   It is common practice to administer 0.2mg of glycopyrrolate or some atropine to increase the heart rate (HR) to prevent a repeated episode of bradycardia with reinflating the abdomen.
-   Inform the surgeon when you feel it is safe to reinflate the abdomen.

**Starting with a low HR:**

-   Before the pneumoperitoneum, if your patient's HR is around 50 or 60 BPM (despite normal BP), consider administering 0.2 mg of glycopyrrolate prophylactically to prevent severe bradycardia.

**Possible complications:**

-   Hemorrhage
-   Perforation of the common bile duct with bile leakage
-   Sub-hepatic abscess
-   Retained bile duct stones
-   Pancreatitis
-   Pneumothorax
-   Atelectasis
-   Shoulder pain from insufflation
-   Post-cholecystectomy syndrome-continued pain post-procedure
