### Hysteroscopy

These cases are usually posted concomitantly as Hysteroscopy and D & C or D & E.  
They are kind of like a cystoscopy, except they are looking into the uterus and not the bladder. A Hysteroscopy is a non-invasive diagnostic or operative procedure. The hysteroscopy utilizes a hysteroscope that is inserted through the vagina and cervix to view inside the uterine cavity.  
  
**Diagnostic Hysteroscopy**  
The hysteroscopy involves slightly widening the cervical canal with a series of dilators. Once the cervix is dilated, a hysteroscope is inserted through the cervix and into the lower end of the uterus. Carbon dioxide gas or solutions are then injected into the uterus, through the hysteroscope, to expand the uterine cavity for visualization.

**Operative Hysteroscopy:**  
The use of a hysteroscope allows operating instruments such as scissors, biopsy forceps and electrosurgical or laser tools into the uterine cavity via a channel in the hysteroscope. Small fibroids, scar tissue or polyps are then removed from inside the uterus.

**Anesthetic:** General/LMA or ETT  
A Hysteroscopy done alone-can be a MAC.  
**Spinal: rare**  
**Duration:** For a diagnostic procedure- it is quick.  
If it is an operative procedure, the duration depends on the procedure.  
**Position:** Lithotomy with arms out, slight Trendelenburg.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
**EBL:** If the procedure is diagnostic, then it will most likely be minimal. If it is an operative case, the EBL depends on the procedure.

**Possible Complications**  
Infection  
Bleeding  
Pelvic inflammatory disease  
Rare Perforation of the uterus or damage to the cervix.   
Complications from fluid or gas used to expand the uterus.
