### Cross Clamp Off, Give MgSO4 IV

**Give 2 grams MgSO4 IV** as soon as the aortic cross clamp is off. Sometimes as soon as the cross clamp is removed, ventricular fibrillation occurs.  
  
MgSO4 serves as a membrane stabilizer and helps prevent fibrillation.  
  
Once the cross clamp is removed, the heart is now filling and the “native” coronary arteries are being perfused. The new grafts’ proximal ends are still not connected to the aorta. The heart may be quivering or starting to beat by now, or soon do so.
