### Bridion (Sugammadex)

  
_Robert Austin, CRNA-APRN, MSN, Maj, USAF (Retired)_

**Class:** Selective Muscle Relaxant (steroidal) binding and reversal agent. Works only for Rocuronium, Vecuronium and Pancuronium.

**Dose: TOF twitch-dependent**

**Routine dose with 2 TO4 twitches:** 2 mg/kg - reversal time is 1.5 minutes.

**Zero twitches with 1-2 post-titanic twitch:** 4 mg/kg - reversal time 3 minutes.

**Emergency reversal (3 minutes after Roc max intubating does (1.2 mg/kg):** 16 mg/kg - reversal time 3 minutes. There are no data to support the use of sugammadex for immediate reversal following vecuronium induced blockade  
Administered as a single rapid bolus.

**No co-administration of an anticholinergic is required.**  
Comes as a single dose vial 200 mg/2ml or 500 mg/5ml.  
Can be used for residual blockade in PACU in patients who received neostigmine.  
No dose adjustment is required for geriatric use, unless renal function is severely compromised.

**Readministration of Steroidal Neuromuscular Blockers:** A minimum wait time is necessary before readministering a steroidal neuromuscular blocking agent after giving sugammadex.  
If sugammadex was dosed at 2 or 4 mg/kg, rocuronium can be redosed after 5 minutes at 1.2 mg/kg. After 4 hours, vecuronium can be administered at 0.1 mg/kg and rocuronium at 0.6 mg/kg. If rocuronium is redosed within 30 minutes of administration of sugammadex, onset of neuromuscular blockade may be delayed up to 4 minutes and duration of effect may be shortened to ~ 15 minutes. If bridion was dosed at 16 mg/kg, the recommended wait time to redose a steroidal neuromuscular blocking agent (rocuronium, vecuronium and pancuronium) is 24 HOURS.  
If neuromuscular blockade is needed before the wait time has elapsed, USE a NONSTEROIDAL NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKING AGENT!

**MOA**  
Sugammadex encapsulates the steroidal muscle relaxant molecule with a 1:1 ratio. It is a cyclodextrin that noncovalently binds the steroidal muscle relaxant within the sugar ring of the suggamadex molecule, preventing Rocuronium (Vec/Panc) from binding to the nicotinic Acetylcholine receptors, permitting immediate reversal.

**Contraindications:** "Known hypersensitivity to sugammadex or any of its components."  
Sugammadex is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment. No dosage adjustment is required for mild or moderate renal impairment.  
Use in children under 17 has not been evaluated.  
Use in pregnancy has not been evaluated in humans. No treatment-related maternal or embryofetal changes were observed in animals.  
Use in lactation has not been evaluated in humans. Sugammadex was detected in the breast milk in animal studies, but no effect was detected in prenatal and postnatal development studies.

**Incompatibility:** Sugammadex is physically incompatible with verapamil, ondansetron, and ranitidine. Flush the line between the administration of sugammadex and other medications.

**Risks: Recurrence of neuromuscular blockade.** This can occur due to displacement of sugammadex by other medications, specifically toremifene, an estrogen antagonist hormonal oncologic medication. Recurrence can occur with lower than recommended dosing. Recurrence of neuromuscular blockade can occur with use of drugs in the postoperative phase that potentiate neuromuscular blockade. MECHANICAL VENTILATION MAY BE REQUIRED.

**Bridion and hormonal contraceptives**  
With the administration of Bridion, hormonal contraceptives, could become less effective due to a lowering of the (free) plasma concentrations.  
Patients using hormonal contraceptives must use an additional, non-hormonal method of contraception for the next 7 days following BRIDION administration.

**Side Effects:**  
Anaphylaxis occurred in 0.3% of healthy volunteers.  
Pruritus  
Erythema  
Hypocalcemia  
Tachycardia  
Marked bradycardia progressing to cardiac arrest within minutes of administration. Occurs at the same rate between neostigmine and sugammadex.  
Prolonged neuromuscular blockade. Some patients showed a delayed or minimal response to Bridion, so respiratory status must be monitored.  
PONV < 10%  
Hypotension  
Hypertension  
Pain  
Headache  
Dizziness  
Flatulence  
Xerostomia  
Fever  
Chills  
Cough  
Insomnia  
Anxiety  
Restlessness  
Depression  
QT abnormality (prolonged)  
Increased serum creatinine phosphokinase  
Temporarily reduces effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives (~ 7 days). Advise women using hormonal contraceptives to use and alternate method of birth control.  
Small transient increase in aPTT and PT occurs within minutes of administration but resolves within one hour. No increased bleeding found.

**Overdose:** Administration at 40 mg/kg produce no noticeable adverse events.

**More Notes  
**Sugammadex was specifically designed to bind to Rocuronium, but as stated above, it will also bind to the other steroidals - vecuronuium and Pancuronium.

_Sugammadex has NO affinity (will not reverse) with other classes of muscle relaxants such as succinylcholine and benzylisoquinoliums (atracurium, cisatracurium amd mivacuronium)._

'Recurarisation', a phenomenon of recurrence of neuromuscular block, may occur where the reversal agents wear off before a neuromuscular blocking drug is completely cleared. The underlying mechanism is thought to be related to redistribution of relaxant after reversal.

It has been demonstrated to occur only rarely with sugammadex, and only when insufficient doses were administered.

Although sugammadex has a lower affinity for vecuronium than for rocuronium, reversal of vecuronium is still effective because fewer vecuronium molecules are present in vivo for equivalent blockade.

Vecuronium is approximately seven times more potent than Rocuronium.

Sugammadex encapsulates with a 1:1 ratio and therefore will adequately reverse vecuronium as there are fewer molecules to bind compared to Rocuronium.

Shallow pancuronium blockade has been successfully reversed by sugammadex in phase III clinical trials.

One molecule of sugammadex is able to noncovalently bind one molecule of steroidal muscle relaxant.

**The Origin of Sugammadex**  
The inventor Dr. Anton Bom was working with organic solvents to dissolve Rocuronium. He investigated cyclodextrin compounds that were known to dissolve Rocuronium.  
  
Cyclodextrins are ring-shaped rigid molecules composed of sugar units. Outside of the cyclodextrins are hydrophilic (water-soluble). The hole in the middle is hydrophobic. This permits steroids (lipophilic) to enter the cavity and create a water-soluble complex. This binding prevents Rocuronium from acting on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and permit immediate reversal.  
  
At first, the affinity between Rocuronium was weak. A few molecular modifications were made and a side was added to each sugar unit. These changes permitted a tight complex between the quaternary nitrogen of Rocuronium and the negatively charged end of the side-chains. After the affinity between the two were maximized, a commercially available cyclodextrin molecule was applied for production.

The patent for sugammadex and related cyclodextrin was in 2001.  
Sugammadex is presently approved in 57 countries.  
As of March 15 2015, 11.5 million patents have received the drug.
