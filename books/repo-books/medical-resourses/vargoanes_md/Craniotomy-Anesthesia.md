### Craniotomy Anesthesia

Textbooks tell us to run 0.5 MAC of an inhalation agent with a narcotic drip and with a Neosynephrine and Nitroglycerine drip while titrating all to effect.  
A full MAC increases CBF and ICP and may also inhibit cerebral autoregulation for blood flow.  
  
However, I still see many anesthesia providers run a full MAC of gas with no narcotic drip and the patients appear to do just fine. The only people who seem to notice are the monitor techs.  
  
**Pre-op** :  
Assess baseline neurological status. You can get an idea how critical the patients are by their symptoms and how they match up the certain ICP levels.  
If they are intubated, they will remain intubated.  
Find out what kind of tumor and its location. The location gives you an idea on how to position the patient and what deficits may exist. Most of us verify position with the surgeon.  
Find out if there are any acute or chronic changes. Patients with acute changes are more likely to be sensitive to anesthetic effects on ICP.  
Slow growth tumors are usually asymptomatic for long periods.  
MRI: Is there brain edema, a midline shift > than 0.5 cm and ventricular size changes?  
**Labs:** Check electrolytes: these patients are prone to electrolyte abnormalities secondary to loop diuretics.  
**Meds To consider:**  
**Steroids:** Brain tumors patients are usually on them. Patients on chronic steroids may be hypo-adrenal, so be alert for refractory hypotension.  
  
**Anticonvulsants:** Is the patient on any?  
If yes, check anticonvulsant levels along with your CBC and Electrolytes.  
**Pre medication:** Avoid benzodiazepines and opiates if an elevated ICP is a concern. Sedation can cause hypoventilation and hypercapnia which dilates cerebral vessels and increases ICP. Sedation can mask the neurologic exam.  
**Possible Drips:**  
Nipride or Nitroglycerine: Titrate to effect  
Neosynephrine: Titrate to effect  
Propofol: 50-100mcg/kg/min.  
Remifentanil: 0.02-0.2mcg/kg/min.  
Sufenta: Some prefer Sufenta over Remifentanil.  
**Vasodilators-** Some textbooks tell us to avoid vasodilators until the dura is open. We usually still titrate nitroglycerine to drop the BP as needed.  
Transient hypotension should generally be treated with incremental doses of Ephedrine or Neosynephrine rather than IV Fluids. We usually just titrate the Neosynephrine.  
**Foley catheter** : yes  
**Hydration:** Don’t over-hydrate because more fluid will go to the brain. Giving 500mLs of albumin early in the case after 1 liter of crystalloid is popular (Hespan not used much anymore).  
**Most Stimulating Events During Craniotomy: (When to make your patient deeper)**  
Laryngoscopy and Tracheal intubation  
Tightening Mayfield Pins  
Incision to skin, bone cutting (skull) and dura mater.  
Suture of dura mater and scalp.

Don’t let the patient get light when they are applying the head dressing because accidental hand contact against the ETT can cause bucking. This is why you are advised not to reverse or turn off your agents until the dressing is complete.  
  
**BP:** Always ask the surgeon ahead of time where he wants the BP.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
**Induction:** Goal is to induce gently to avoid increasing ICP or compromising CBF. For an Aneurysm, the ICP is less important than hypertension with induction. The mortality rate associated with aneurysmal rupture during induction is substantial. Large drops in BP can also compromise the CPP.  
**Thiopental:** OK but most hospital pharmacies do not stock this drug anymore.  
**Propofol or Etomidate:** Ok for use.

**Esmolol:** 100-150mg 2 minutes before laryngoscopy to prevent tachycardia.  
**Nitroglycerine:** Connected and ready to titrate to effect.  
**LTA Kit** : You should, but many still don’t use one.  
**Hyperventilation** : To lower ICP after intubation.  
Keep ETCO 2 around 30-35mmHg and check a blood gas after induction before incision.  
**Fentanyl:** 5-10mcg/kg can be given prior to laryngoscopy.  
**Remifentanil:** Can also be used.

**Remi Induction dose:** 1-3mcg/kg over 1 minute.  
**Remi-Induction drip:** 0.5- 1mcg/kg/min and intubate in 5-8 minutes.  
**Muscle Relaxants:** Yes, usually Roc or Vec, depends on the monitoring. Deeply paralyze for intubation. **Avoid movement! Anectine** increases ICP, so avoid it if at all possible. If there is a difficult airway, you may need it because hypoxia and hypercarbia are worse for the ICP. Follow with a NDMR when twitches are back.  
**Warning:** The duration of action of NDMR is reduced by many anticonvulsants. Atracurium and Cisatracurium are not effected by anticonvulsants because of Hoffman elimination. However, we still usually use Roc and Vec.  
**Inhalation Agent:** Usually Isoflurane at ½ MAC. Running a full MAC of Iso, Sevo or Desflurane increases CBF and ICP. Many still use a full MAC.  
**Narcotic Drip:** Sufenta or Remifentanil are common drips to run to support the ½ MAC inhalation agent.  
**IV Access:** 1-2 large bore IVs (14-18g).  
**IV Fluid:** All texts books say NS, but most of us still use LR. Remember, there is about 100mLs of free water with a liter of LR. Avoid Dextrose containing IV as it exacerbates ischemia (increases neuronal lactate production) and edema with neuro deficits possible.  
**Hydration:** Normovolemic: volume restriction is no longer used to treat elevated ICP. So you don’t need to keep them dry. Do not over hydrate.  
**Temperature:** Normothermic.  
Hyperthermia increases brain damage.  
Hypothermia: a decrease of body temp by 2°–3°C) is a major neuro-protectant. Sometimes used with bypass.  
  
**Nitrous Oxide:** NO, when combined with a volatile anesthetic, it can further increase CBF. When given alone, nitrous oxide causes mild cerebral vasodilation and can potentially increase ICP. However, it is OK to use at the end of the case to carry off the Isoflurane or Sevoflurane via the 2 nd gas effect.  
  
**Central Line and CVP** : Not common anymore unless they expect a large EBL or a very long case.  
**A-line:** Yes. Usually inserted after induction if it’s an aneurysm.  
**Neuro Monitoring:** Can be Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), motor evoked potentials(MEP), and electromyography(EMG).  
According to the Monitor Techs:  
Somatosensory Evoked Potentials or SEP: < 0.5MAC is best; ok to paralyze.  
Motor Evoked Potentials or MEP (Transcranial motor evoked potentials or TceMEP or Cortical motor evoked potentials or CMAP): < 0.5 MAC is best; don’t paralyze.  
EMG: Full MAC is OK, don’t paralyze.  
  
**Positioning:** Find out ahead of time if possible the surgeon’s preference. Frontal, temporal, and parieto-occipital craniotomies are supine.  
HOB up 15-30 degrees to facilitate venous drainage and drainage of CSF.  
Make sure the patient’s head is not flexed or rotated too far because it could decrease jugular venous drainage and can increase ICP.  
Make sure your vent tubing is stretched out and aligned correctly before the OR staff rotates the bed 90-180 degrees. Many of us tape the vent tubing out of the way over the patient’s chest. Arms are usually to the side but not tightly tucked.

**Head stability:** Either on towels, a cerebellar head rest or placed in three fixation points (Mayfield Head Pins).

**Mayfield Pins and Propofol:** The application of Mayfield Pins is very stimulating. Most of us bolus with 50-100mg of Propofol just prior to tightening the pins to prevent the BP from skyrocketing. So have some extra Propofol available.

**Intra-Op Maintenance**  
Communication is key.  
Titrate your inhalation agents, drips and narcotics with the desired BP. Don’t use crystalloids to correct hypotension.  
**Ventilation:** Only mildly hyperventilate. Keeping the ETCO 2 around 30-35 mmHg. For every 1 mm Hg decrease in pCO­ 2 , CBF decreases by 1-2 mL per 100g/min which is usually adequate to offset the vasodilatory effects of volatile anesthetics.  
If you OVER ventilate, the hypocarbia can decrease cerebral perfusion too much.  
Avoid Peep >10 cm. It could decrease venous drainage and increase ICP.  
**ABGs:** Get a baseline before incision. Consider switching to LR if there is metabolic acidosis. There is a potential for hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with IV NS. This is very rare. Check your PaCO 2 .  
**Blood Loss:** Should be replaced at a 3:1 ratio (3L crystalloids for every liter EBL) to a hematocrit of 25-30%.  
  
**Brain Protection Meds**  
If you don’t know your surgeon’s regiment, you should ask him/her about the three drugs  
below. The surgeon will tell you how much and when to give them either way.  
**Mannitol:** 0.25-1 gram/kg (25-50g) prior to opening the Dura.

**Lasix:** usually 10-20mg prior to opening the Dura.  
**Steroids:** Usually Decadron or Solu-Medrol. 10mg Q2 hrs is not unusual.  
**Dilantin:** 1g; it is rarely given anymore. Don’t bolus it.  
  
**After Dura Incision:** Anesthetic requirements drop substantially because the brain has no pain receptors. At this point, Propofol 50-150mcg/kg/min with Remifentanil 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg/min would be adequate while avoiding a slow wake up.  
**Reversal:** It is recommended not to reverse your muscle relaxant until the dressing is on.

After the head dressing is applied, the table will be turned back to its original position towards you. 

**Emergence Warning:** There is an association between emergence hypertension and post-operative hemorrhage. So avoid bucking and hypertension.  
  
**Emergence Recommendations:**  
Check with the surgeon concerning deep or awake extubation. We usually perform a deep extubation unless there was difficult airway. Some surgeons prefer a neurologic exam before leaving the operating room, but that is rare anymore. If the patient was already intubated, they will remain intubated at the end of surgery. There is no emergence.

**Popular Crani Emergence Drugs**

**Lidocaine:** 1.5mg/kg 1-2 minutes prior to suctioning and extubation.  
**Labetalol:** 40-60mg with emergence if the BP permits.

**Precedex Drip:** Can also be used and some CRNAs love Precdex for this very purpose.  
0.2-1.0mcg/kg/hr is the dose range. A 200mcg/2mL vial (100mcg/mL) is injected in 48mLs (aspirate 2 mLs from 50 cc bag) of NS which gives you 4mcg/mL. For a 80kg patient, 0.5mcg/kg/hr is infused at 10mLs/hr.  
  
**Antiemetics:** PONV is very common with Craniotomies. Studies show a prophylactic antiemetic given shortly before emergence reduces PONV. 4mg Zofran is the standard.  
  
**If the patient does not wake up, it could be from:**  
An elevated ICP  
Residual anesthesia or paralysis  
CO 2 narcosis, hypoxia, and hypercarbia.  
Consider giving physostigmine (0.01-0.03 mg/kg) and/or Narcan (0.04 - 0.4 mg) to facilitate awakening. Titrate the Narcan very slowly; many of us will take 1cc or 0.4 mg of Narcan and dilute it in 9 cc diluent so there is 40 mcgs per cc. Give 1-2 ccs and then wait. Let the drug do its work. RE-assess. This is not the time to go for a quick wakeup; patience is the key.  
  
**More Notes**  
**Isoflurane** **protects brain through two mechanisms:**  
It reduces excitatory neurotransmitters release by a presynaptic mechanism, an effect comparable to hypothermia (K Nakashima et al 1996).  
It decreases neuronal metabolism by a nontoxic mechanism.  
It lowers glucose takeover in neurons.  
It can induce an EEG isoelectric line at non-toxic concentrations of 2 MAC.  
Combining TIVA and Isoflurane is becoming popular.

**Mayfield Pin Complications**  
Severe hypertension with application  
Over tightening- skull fracture  
Bleeding requiring suturing  
Laceration-pins not tight enough
