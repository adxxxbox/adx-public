### CSE Dosing Review

  
CSE:(Combined Spinal Epidural)  
**_By Lisa Stiel Moreno, CRNA_**

The combination of CSE and PCEA is the best approach to labor analgesia and decreased anesthesia manpower requirements.

**Spinal Dose with CSE**  
Dosing for the spinal portion of the CSE is highly dependent upon the desired effect. As stated above, if the CSE is done due to precipitous labor, then the dosages are significantly less than for a surgical block (C-section). If the CSE is performed for a surgical block, then the dosages will be at the standard levels.

**Dosing the Epidural**  
If the decision to perform the CSE was to have the epidural as a "back-up" anesthetic just in case the C-section took too long, then there may be no need to dose the epidural.  
In these instances the epidural can be discontinued immediately post-operatively or prior to the patient being transferred out of the Recovery Room.  
If the epidural is required to provide surgical anesthesia, then initial dosing can be performed with whichever your drug of choice is. Lidocaine 2%, Marcaine 0.5%, or Ropivicaine 0.5% all provide adequate surgical anesthesia.  
  
**I personally dose with 2% Lidocaine for multiple reasons:**  
**First:** is that if I do get a block that is higher than I wanted, it will recede rather quickly.  
**Second:** Lidocaine is less toxic if the epidural is intravascular.  
Remember - Epidural test dosing a CSE is not always clear, so erring on the side of caution is always best.  
**Third:** Lidocaine has a quick onset.  
With that said, utilizing Ropivacaine or Marcaine for dosing is acceptable as well, and will provide for a longer block than Lidocaine.

**Only start with 3-5 mLs for epidural dosing with a CSE**  
In general, when bolusing the epidural the volume utilized will be anywhere from 3-5mls as a starting point with any of the above local anesthetics. You can always give more, but once given you can't take it away.  
Dosing incrementally and assessing your block is a very safe practice.
