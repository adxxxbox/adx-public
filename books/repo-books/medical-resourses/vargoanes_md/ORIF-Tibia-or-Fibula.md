### ORIF of Tibia/Fibula Fracture

Tibia fractures have different classifications depending on location and severity.  
The variety of Tib/Fib fractures are usually not our concern because the anesthesia plan stays the same. The fracture will still be repaired by either the use of plates, screws or an intramedullary (IM) rod to stabilize the bone.

**Anesthesia:** General/LMA or ETT.  
**Regional:** This is optional: it can be a one sided spinal, or a femoral nerve block, then you may have to flip the patient over for a sciatic nerve block. Regionals are not as common as a general.   

**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
**Position:** Supine with arms out.  
  
**Possible Complications:**  
Compartment syndrome.  
Superficial Infection is the most common complication.  
Neuropraxia  
  
**More Notes**

A lag screw should be used to achieve interfragmentary compression. Locking plates are used when shaft fractures extend towards the joint and leave the surgeon with a small distal fragment to contend with.
