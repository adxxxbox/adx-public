# Dextran

**Dextran 40** is an antithromotic (anti-platelet).  
**Dextran 70** was used as a volume expander.  
**Dose**  
Dextran 40 for vascular case: 42mL/hr.  
Limit to 20 ml/kg/day.  
**Dextran 40 (Rheomacrodex)**  
Sometimes used during vascular cases requested by older surgeons.  
Improves blood flow through microcirculation presumably by decreasing blood viscosity.  
To prevent early thombosis of small arteries.  
Flows >20mL/kg/d can interfere with blood typing may prolong bleeding time and can be associated with renal failure.  
**Dextran 70 (Macrodex)**  
A volume expander  
Synthesized by certain bacteria from sucrose.  
Dextran is a complex polysaccharide used medicinally as an antithrombotic (anti-platelet), to reduce blood viscosity, and as a volume expander in anemia.  
Interferes with platelet activation.  
**MOA**  
Binds of erythrocytes, platelets, and vascular endothelium, increasing their electronegativity and thus reducing erythrocyte aggregation and platelet adhesiveness.  
It also reduces factor VIII-Ag Von Willebrand factor, thereby decreasing platelet function.  
It also seems to be incorporated into the polymerising fibrin clot so that it alters clot structure and enhances fibrinogenolysis.  
**Rare Side Effects / Complications**  
Anaphylaxis  
coagulopathy  
Pulmonary Edema  
Cerebral Edema  
Acute Renal Failure  
**Excretion**  
Through the urine, feces and reticulo-endothelial system (RES) (according to molecular size).  
Dextran 40 has molecular weight of 40,000 Daltons.  
Dextran 70 has molecular weight of 70,000 Daltons.
