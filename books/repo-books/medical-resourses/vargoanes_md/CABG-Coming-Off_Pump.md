### CABG - Coming off Pump

**Dr. Robert Mingus, Chattanooga, TN.**  
Most patients coming off of CPB will not need an inotrope if cardiac function is normal to start with, bypass time is under 2 hours and heart protection is adequate. For those needing assistance I find a small dose of Ephedrine (2.5 to 5mcg) is often all that is needed for a “jumpstart” off CPB. I will add a Beta Agonist bolus and infusion 10 minutes prior to separation for those patients suspected of having cardiac dysfunction. All of the beta agonists have their merits; my favorite is epinephrine. For severe dysfunction I will add Milrinone, bolusing 50ug/kg 10 minutes prior to separation and beginning a 0.5ug/kg/min infusion along with a norepinephrine infusion. The synergy of a beta agonist with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor can be profound and the alpha agonist properties of NE can be useful to balance the PDI vasodilation effects. Although sometimes necessary, I try to avoid the use of vasopressin as this drug has many side effects including bowel ischemia. I also encourage the surgeon to place a femoral arterial line pre-CPB if severe cardiac dysfunction is suspect (e.g., a MVR/CABG with low EF). Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation is an excellent complement to maximum inotrope therapy. Since Calcium Chloride is known to contribute to reperfusion injury in the separation period, I only administer it when I can document or strongly suspect a low ionized Ca++ level.

First of all, around 80% of our hearts are now off pump. So I will write about the remaining 20%. My favorite for coming off pump is use nothing at all! However, we all know we may only see that with young healthy hearts with EF’s around 50% without a prolonged bypass time. As we all know that everything is situational and varies from patient to patient. Plus many surgeons have their favorite drips, so you might be limited on a favorite cocktail.

Here is what I do or have seen where I work:  
  
Some surgeons still prefer us to use Dobutamine or Dopamine. So we use them with a Neosynephrine drip until we catch up giving the volume while coming off bypass.  
  
“Jumpstarting” the heart - we dilute a syringe of epinephrine to 1mcg/mL and give 1-3 mcg of epinephrine (one at a time) a little bit after the cross clamp is off and while the Perfusionist is lowering his flow rates as we are coming off bypass.  
  
Though this is not a drip, we give a little bit of NTG to dilate the patient while the Perfusionist gives 100mL boluses through the aortic cannula as per surgeons request before the aortic cannula is removed. A few boluses can increase the BP.  
  
Over all, we don’t use as much Dopamine or Dobutamine anymore.  
Milrinone is a great inotrope, especially if it’s a valve with pulmonary hypertension. Milrinone and Neosynephrine is a common cocktail. Once you catch the patient up with the post pump volume of Hespan or cell saver blood, the Neosynephrine drip is usually weaned first and then the Milrinone is weaned.  
  
Vasoconstrictors-we may not use Levophed as much as others. We still try to stick with Neosynephrine.  
  
For a really sick heart: Epi drip with the IABP.  
If the patient came over from the cath lab with an IABP and drips, sometimes we go straight to an Epi drip.

When I use Milrinone and give the suggested bolus of 50mcg/kg over 10 minutes, I find that the basic supportive Neosynephrine drip is not strong enough to counter the vasodilation effects of Milrinone. I just start with a low dose of Levophed and titrate to effect.  
If I don’t give the Milrinone bolus, than I use Neosynephrine. Sometimes I use Dobutamine and Neo instead of Milrinone. However, Dobutamine tends to cause tachycardia, which we want to avoid.

If it is a very healthy patient with a bypass less than 2 -3 hours, I try to come off with nothing.

If the heart needs assistance, I like to come off with .05-0.1mcg/kg/min of Epinephrine. I start it early to jumpstart the heart-when the aortic cross clamp comes off. When the aortic clamp comes off, I know there is at least 10 minutes between removing the cross clamp to coming off pump. I titrate from there.  
  
CaCl-Just about everybody comes of pump with a below normal ionized Ca. I like to give the first 500mg of CaCl when I give the protamine to counter the hypotensive effects of Protamine and I could titrate the remaining 500mg as needed per labs and BP.  
  
Where I work, the perfusionists give us the cell saver immediately coming off bypass so I don’t have to start off with albumin. They give us anywhere between 500-1,000mLs. I give an extra 50mg of Protamine after the cell saver is in.

**Concerning Milrinone,** I will use it if they have pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure or mitral regurgitation. I never give the initial bolus because it becomes a strong vasodilator. I just start it early.

One surgeon I work with will give back almost all of the remaining blood in the pump via aortic cannula 100cc at a time. So when the patient receives around 700cc, you could expect the pressure to jump. Consider some NTG to counter that or have the patient placed in reverse Trendelenburg.  
  
Make a good prediction of the inotropic state. If the EF and CI were poor pre CPB, then you pretty much know you it won’t be much different coming off. If the CI and CO was poor pre-op, you will also need an inotrope.  
  
If your inotrope is a Phosphodiesterase Inhibitor (Milrinone), you will also need a constrictor (Milrinone also dilates). If CO and CI were good pre-op, you might just need some Neosynephrine.

I typically use calcium, some light Neo and volume from the pump, cell saver, colloids, PRBCs. I really like using Milrinone to help with contractility coming off pump. If the patient had high PA pressures pre-op as seen with some valve patients or the heart simply looked weak when we were weaning from pump, then Milrinone works well with background neo to counteract with the vasodilation that Milrinone causes, and sometimes Levophed is also required if Milrinone and Neo can't cut it. Some people like using Dobutamine, but the tachycardia it can cause has been problematic in my experience. Also what I think is important (that we have no control over) is giving the heart time to "work", beat, and re-perfuse before coming off pump. So once the bypasses and/or valve repair is complete, the patient is warm, ventilating the lungs, heart beating (either intrinsically or paced), and still on CPB support, the surgeon can give the heart time to re-perfuse before coming completely off pump. This time can really help the heart improve.  
  
The other thing to note is strict blood pressure control when coming off pump. Obviously you don't want hypotension, but hypertension is also undesirable. Ideal SBP 90-110mmHg. So it is always best to use vasoactives and calcium cautiously and in small doses.
