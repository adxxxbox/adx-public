Hydrocephalus and Anesthesia   

## Hydrocephalus and Anesthesia

_Basically, preventing or limiting increases in ICP during anesthesia._

Treatment of hydrocephalus involves surgical implantation of shunt systems to drain the cerebrospinal fluid (See **Ventriculo-Peritoneal (VP Shunt) Insertion.)**

Anesthetic Goals with Hydrocephalus (Non-functional or absent VP shunt)

Some children, especially when ICP is elevated, exhibit an inspiratory stridor. This is due to an “in drawing” of the aryepiglottic folds during inspiration.

Congenital hydrocephalus may have distorted the anatomy of the skull, which can make management of the airway more difficult. Often a pillow placed under the body of the neonate can facilitate laryngoscopy. The use of a nasogastric tube is an important component of managing the neonatal airway and ventilation. Handling should be careful and minimal to reduce the risks of complications (e.g. pneumothoraces).

**Stimuli which cause CSF elevation**

**Physical**  
Struggling during induction  
Choking; Vomiting  
Bucking on the endotracheal tube

**Physiologic**  
Hypercarbia: Hypoxia

**Pathologic**  
Intracranial tumor  
Hemorrhage  
Cerebral edema  
Vascular anomalies  
Hydrocephalus

**Pharmacologic**  
Ketamine  
Most inhalation agents (although this can be counterbalanced by hyperventilation)

Check for baseline neuro function, underlying co-morbidities, and acute issues (e.g. hyperventilation in response to ICP increase, bulging fontanelles, and the effect of head circumference on positioning for airway management.) If the child is being maintained in a head up position this should be continued until ventilation is controlled. Pre-op electrolytes and CBC are generally available and need to be checked. Pre-incision prophylactic antibiotic is indicated.

ICP may be elevated or normal. Even in the face of resting normal ICP hydrocephalus occupies intra-cranial space, thus decreasing the auto-regulatory ability to adjust to any volume change (e.g. increased CO2, position change, cough, etc) that can further increase ICP. Minimizing increases in ICP should be the cornerstone of care. Although this generally means avoiding sedation, it might be necessary for an agitated child. The anesthetist should be in attendance and available to monitor if any sedation is used.

**Pre Medication:** None, or judicious and monitored small doses of midazalam. If the child does not have an IV, EMLA application to several sites may ease insertion and avoid excitement.

**Anesthetic:** General/oral ETT with the head slightly elevated. If using an uncuffed ETT, make sure it fits sufficiently to provide adequate controlled ventilation.

Literature states that TIVA is preferred until the cranium is open. Halogenated agents may increase ICP.  
Most CRNAs still use Sevoflurane and the patients do well.  
  
**Nitrous Oxide:** Avoid

**IV:** Many children will arrive with a functioning IV. If not, insert a small IV in any extremity. You will also have access to the feet during the case.  
**Arterial line:** Usually not needed, unless there is a severely elevated ICP or metabolic derangements present.  
  
**Induction:** IV induction is popular to avoid increases in ICP that can occur with inhalation agents, breath holding and laryngospasm.  
**INDUCTION OF ANAESTHESIA**  
The method of induction is determined by the circumstances of the case and the preference of the patient and the anesthetist.

Intravenous induction allows for rapid control of the airway in emergency situations if the patient is not fasted and if no difficulties with the airway have been anticipated.  
This may be achieved using a suitable induction agent in a carefully titrated sleep dose (propofol 2-4 mg/kg, thiopentone 3-5 mg/kg).  
  
Hypotension should be avoided because of the risk of decreasing CPP in the face of raised ICP. Ketamine should not be used as it can increase ICP.  
  
Muscle relaxation can be achieved with the use of a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMB). Succinylcholine can be used if the risk of aspiration outweighs the problems of transient increases in ICP, otherwise non-depolarizing NMB are preferable.

**Induction/intubation goal:** Avoid coughing, therefore adequate dosing and appropriate timing are important.  
  
**Intubation**  
In some cases, especially with open fontanels the head circumference may be dramatically enlarged making positioning for airway management difficult. I have intubated with a colleague suspending the head off the end of the bed, or had to turn the head to the side for laryngoscopy.

Gaseous induction is an acceptable alternative with a non-irritant volatile anesthetic agent such as sevoflurane or halothane. A rapid gaseous induction is preferable to prolonged attempts at cannulation in a distressed and unwell child. Once anaesthetized, intravenous access should be established quickly to allow the use of a NMB to facilitate control of the airway. Hypercarbia should be avoided as it causes cerebral vasodilation and may worsen raised ICP especially in combination with laryngoscopy and airway manipulation.

**Ventilation:** Maintain normocapnia or mild hypocapnia (ETCO2 30-35mmHg) until the cranium is open to help maintain cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).  
Do not over hyperventilate the patient because it may become difficult to cannulate the ventricle if it is empty from hyperventilation.

To do this hypotension should be avoided and minute ventilation controlled to maintain normocarbia (end tidal CO 4-4.5 kPa) to optimize CPP and avoid increases in ICP. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) should be minimized to avoid venous congestion in the head but may be used if there are difficulties in maintaining oxygenation.

**More Notes:**  
Cerebral blood flow (CBF) determines cerebral blood volume. It is higher in children compared to adults (100 vs 50 ml/100g/min). CBF is coupled to the metabolic demands of the normal brain and regulated via oxygen requirement, PaCO2, and intra-cerebral acidosis.

Auto-regulation allows for a relatively constant blood flow across a wide range of arterial pressures, which can be as low as 40 mmHg in small children. This mechanism is not  
available to premature neonates or during some pathological processes. Reducing PaCO2 causes vasoconstriction of the cerebral vessels. This in turn reduces CBF, blood volume, and ICP; however, it is at the expense of oxygen delivery. Hyperventilation, therefore, should only be used as a short-term measure when ICP is dangerously high, prior to more definitive treatment.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is continuously produced by the choroid plexus, and after circulating through the ventricles is absorbed at the arachnoid villi. In children CSF is produced at the rate of 0.2-0.4 ml/min. Approximately 250 ml of CSF is produced and absorbed per day. An estimated 70 mls of CSF is present within the brain at all times. Any interruption to normal flow, increased production, or decreased reabsorption of CSF can cause hydrocephalus, which in turn may result in elevated ICP. The classical distinction between obstructive and communicating hydrocephalus is less useful clinically as the cause of reduced absorption of CSF in communicating hydrocephalus is usually functional obstruction at the arachnoid villi (e.g. by blood or protein).
