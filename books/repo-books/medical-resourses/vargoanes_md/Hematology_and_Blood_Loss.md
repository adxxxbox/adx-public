## Hematology and Blood Loss (Burn Surgery)

_Providing safe and effective anesthesia for burn surgery requires an understanding of the pathophysiological consequences of a severe burn trauma._

The combination of a burn injury and fluid resuscitation during the acute phase results in dilutional anemia and thrombocytopenia.

RBCs are also lost through heat-induced damage and bleeding burn wounds, particularly during excision and debridement procedures.

Activation of clotting factors in the burn wound itself induces a hypercoagulable state that further compromises hematologic stability and increases the risk for venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and less commonly, disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Blood loss during burn surgery is related to the amount of burn area excised. EBL for debridement procedures are around 4cc/cm2 .

**Blood conservation strategies include:**  

-   Early excision and wound closure; by far the most important intervention pending burn severity
-   Tourniquets
-   Albumin; use cautiously in early resuscitation due to capillary leak, potential respiratory compromise
-   Cell saver
-   Hemostatic agents (eg, fibrin sealant)
-   Amicar or Tranexamic Acid; careful use of anti-fibrinolytics/pro-coagulants with non-emergent circumstances
-   Epinephrine soaked dressings

Most guidelines support blood transfusion when hemoglobin decreases below 6 g/dL.  
Some burn transfusion protocols will transfuse when the hemoglobin is 8.1g/dL.  
Restricted blood transfusion protocols are associated with reduced mortality and rates of infection in adults and children with major burns

Transfusions are transplants.  
Warming of blood is recommended post-filter to preserve filter efficacy.  
Caution transfusion induced inflammatory reactions, electrolyte shifts (hyperkalemia), and citrate toxicity.  
**Blood loss during burn surgery** is most closely related to the amount of burn area excised.  
**Reducing blood transfusions** are associated with reduced mortality and rates of infection in adults and children with major burns. Ask yourself, “Why am I giving blood and who am I treating?”
