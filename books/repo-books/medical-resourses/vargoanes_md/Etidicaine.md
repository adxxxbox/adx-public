## Etidacaine

**Etidacaine (Duranest)**  
**Class:** Amide type local anesthetic, Long acting  
**Max w/o Epi:** 0.4mg/kg or 300mg  
**Max with Epi:** 400mg  
**Uses:** Local and retrobulbar anesthesia in surgical and dental procedures.  
Has a rapid onset of sensory and motor blockade Duration of analgesia is 1.5-2 times longer than lidocaine when given epidurally. **Epidural:** produces profound motor blockade and muscle relaxation.  
**Rapidly absorbed** from parenteral injection sites, and epidural injections of 1% solutions result in anesthesia within 2-8 minutes, with complete sensory and motor blockade occurring in less than 20 minutes.  
Structurally similar to Lidocaine, but the metabolites differ.  
**Doses:**  
**Infiltration 0.5%**  
Onset: Fast:  
Duration: 120-480 mins  
w/o Epi: 300mg  
with Epi; 400mg  
**Peripheral Nerve Block 0.5-1%**  
Onset: Fast  
Duration: 120-480 mins  
w/o Epi: 300mg  
with Epi; 400mg  
**Epidural 1-1.5% (not recommended for deliveries)**  
Onset: Fast  
Duration: 120-480 mins  
w/o Epi: 300mg  
with Epi; 400mg  
**Spinal: DO NOT USE FOR SPINALS due to profound motor block**  
Passively diffuses across blood-brain and placental barriers, and fetal plasma levels are usually 20-30% of maternal plasma concentrations.  
**MOA:** Like other local anesthetics, it binds to the intracellular portion of sodium channels and blocks sodium influx into nerve cells, which prevents depolarization.  
**In Detail:** Prevents transmission of nerve impulses by inhibiting the passage of Na ions through their specific channels. It is speculated that local anesthetics bind to specific sites on the inner portion of the Na channels (internal gate or H gate) near their external openings to maintain those channels in an inactivated state.  
**Metabolized:** Liver  
**Excreted:** Kidneys  
20 metabolites of Etidacaine have been found in the urine  
**CNS and Cardiac Manifestations to watch for:**  
Euphoria  
Dizziness  
Tinnitus  
Twitching  
Tremors  
Convulsions  
Hypotension  
Cardiac Arrest
