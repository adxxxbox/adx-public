### Ibutilide (Corvert) IV

A class III antiarrhythmic agent.  
  
**Indications:** To convert a rapid onset of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm (NSR).  
It can be used as an alternative or pretreatment for cardioversion.  
**  
Mechanism of action Ibutilide:  
Potassium channel blocker that prolongs phase 3 of the cardiac action potential, resulting in increased refractoriness of:**  
\- Atrial and ventricular myocytes  
\- Atrioventricular node  
\- His-Purkinje system.  
**  
Notable ECG changes from Ibutilide:  
**\- Slowing of heart rate  
\- Prolongation of QT interval (risk of developing torsades de pointes)**  
  
The pre-administration of magnesium sulfate:**  
The pre-administration of magnesium has been shown to enhance the ability of ibutilide to convert atrial flutter or fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm.  
Magnesium can also help prevent the prolongation of the QT interval, and it sees frequent use in treating torsades de pointes in hemodynamically stable patients.  
**Dosing:  
Adults (> 60 kg):** 1 mg IV over 10 mins; may repeat once**Adults (< 60 kg) and children:** 0.01 mg/kg IV over 10 mins; may repeat once  
  
**The technique of administration:  
**\- It may be diluted or undiluted.  
\- It can be diluted in a 20 cc syringe with a very slow push.  
\- Administer over 10 minutes  
  
**Discontinue infusion upon:**  
\- Resolution of presenting arrhythmia  
\- New-onset ventricular tachycardia  
  
**Class 1C Antiarrhythmics:** Ibutilide can be given safely with Class 1C antiarrhythmics since class 1C antiarrhythmics do not affect the QT interval.**Amiodarone:** The risk of arrhythmia does not increase when clinicians give patients ibutilide with amiodarone.  
**Pharmacokinetics:  
**Conversion to sinus rhythm occurs less than 90 minutes after the start of infusion.  
**Half-life:** Around 6 hours, ranging between 2 and 12 hours.  
**Metabolized:** Liver  
**Metabolites:** Eight metabolites (1 active).  
**The volume of distribution:** 11/Kg  
**Excretion:** The majority in urine as inactive metabolites  
  
**Warning:**  
According to the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP), this drug has a heightened risk of causing significant patient harm.  
It can cause potentially fatal arrhythmias, so clinicians must always weigh the benefits vs. risks when using this agent.  
  
**Cardiac Adverse Effects:  
**\- Nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia  
\- Premature ventricular contractions  
\- Nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia  
\- Atrioventricular block  
\- Bundle branch block  
\- Hypotension  
\- Torsades de pointes  
\- Prolonged QT interval  
\- Hypertension  
\- Palpitations  
\- Bradycardia  
  
**Extracardiac Adverse Effects:  
**\- Nausea  
\- Headache  
\- Renal failure  
\- Erythematous rash  
  
**Contraindications:**  
\- Hypersensitivity to ibutilide or any compound in the formulation  
\- Congenital long QT syndrome  
\- A patient history of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia  
\- Uncorrected electrolyte abnormalities  
\- Sinus node disease  
\- Structural cardiac disease  
  
**Caution is advised in the following situations:  
**\- QT prolongation  
\- A family history of QT prolongation  
\- Recent myocardial infarct  
\- Bradycardia  
\- Congestive heart failure (CHF)  
\- Age 65 and older  
\- Hepatic impairment; while no dining recommendations exist, the drug is metabolized by CYP450 enzymes, so caution is advised in such patients.
