### Intraoperative Neuromonitoring (IOM)

Simply put, it is the Intraoperative monitoring of nerves, referred to as either intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring or intraoperative neuromonitoring.

IOM monitors the patient’s nervous system throughout the surgical procedure. IOM helps prevent damage to the spinal cord, brain, and/or nerves. Therefore, the use of intraoperative monitoring reduces the risk of surgery-related nerve damage. IOM is often used during neck and back procedures where complications may cause a loss of neurological function.

Electrodes are placed on and/or under the skin at various locations along a nerve pathway. The electrodes are connected to a computer that analyzes information about the nerve(s) being monitored.

Next, an electrode will stimulate the nerve with an electrical impulse. The impulse is brief (a fraction of a second) and contains a very low amount of electrical current.

Following the stimulation, the nerve's activity is assessed. The other electrodes along the nerve pathway record the time it takes for electrical impulses to travel between them. The speed of the signal is calculated using the distance between electrodes and the time it takes the impulses to travel between them.

The baseline information is compared to that obtained throughout the surgical procedure. If the signal becomes slower and weaker, this reveals a problem with the nerve (e.g., it is being compressed). Therefore, changes in signal responses allow a surgeon to quickly identify a problem and, when necessary, take corrective action before nerve damage becomes permanent.
