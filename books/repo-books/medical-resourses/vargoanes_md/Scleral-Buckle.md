### Scleral Buckle

Repair of Retinal Detachment.

There are 2 common surgical methods for repairing a detached retina.  They can be combined. 

**The Vitrectomy** uses an internal technique.

**The Scleral Buckle** uses an exterior technique.   

The scleral buckle method indents the wall of the eye inward (from the outside) so that it meets the hole in the retina. Then there is a placement of a support positioned like a belt around the walls of the eyeball to maintain the retina in a proper, attached position.  
**Anesthetic:** Usually MAC with a Retrobulbar block  
Usually 2mg of Versed pre-op and Alfenta or Propofol just prior to the retrobulbar block.

Sometimes a General with an Oral Rae or LMA is necessary. Avoid Anectine.

Don’t over-sedate the patient if under a MAC because snoring makes the eye look like an earthquake through the microscope.  
   
**Position:** Supine with arms tucked and the patient remains on the same stretcher. Make sure the ETCO2 NC is looped away from the surgical eye. The stretcher is parked 90-180 degrees away from you (unless you are starting out as a general).  
**IV Access**: 22G is acceptable. A 500mL NS bag with micro drip tubing is popular.  
**EBL**: Minimal  
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes. Depends on the surgeon.  
**Diagnosis:** Usually a detached retina.

**Further:** Consider an antiemetic towards the end of a case, especially if the patient has a history of kinetosis, or motion sickness. Car sickness, sea sickness, any motion related sickness means consideration of low dose or short half-life narcotics, Zofran, Decadron, and possibly a Scopolamine patch. If the patch is needed, get it on the patient as early in pre-op as possible. It takes an hour or longer to become effective. Retching increases IOP. Be careful giving Toradol. Some Vitrectomies are hemorrhage related. Consider IV Ofirmev instead.  Many of these patients are diabetic and very hypertensive.

**More Notes**  
Scleral Buckling success rate: 86%  
Vitrectomy success rate: 90%

Combined Vitrectomy and Scleral Buckling: 94%  
Pneumatic retinopexy surgery: 63%

The scleral buckle can be combined with draining fluid out from UNDER the retina. Scleral buckling surgery can reattach the retina without the need for a gas bubble injection. The retina is usually reattached using a bubble of air or other gas. Then the tear is sealed with laser. The air is replaced with a gas that acts as an internal “splint”, thus holding the retina in place.

A scleral buckle is effective in young persons or situations where the retina is torn at the bottom of the eye. This technique is used alone or in combination with vitrectomy and is essential in repairing more complicated retinal detachments.
