### Removal of Loose Bodies

Usually part of an orthopedic arthroscopic procedure. Half the time you are not aware the procedure was performed until the surgeon states it was done at the end of the case.

**Remove Loose Bodies**: Free floating pieces of debris in the joint. They are tissues that have torn away from their original location and move around inside the joint, causing pain, swelling and locking. They are removed.
