### Cardiac Surgery Outcomes: Male vs Female

The mortality rate in women is 4.60% vs 2.53% for men.  
  
Men are more likely than women to have more than three diseased coronary arteries, to have left ventricular dysfunction and to have a mammary artery graft. Women were more likely to have diabetes, stage 3 to 5 chronic kidney disease, and chronic lung disease, to be undergoing a non-elective (emergency) CABG, and to be older.  
  
Women undergoing PCI and CABG on average are older than men and more often have diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and severe non-cardiac disease.  
  
Suggested contributing factors have included women’s increased age, advanced disease, comorbidities, and smaller body surface area (BSA).  
In addition, women who are referred to CABG have more advanced CAD than men. A study among 1,170 CAD patients indicates that women experience more severe symptoms of angina than men at the time they are undergoing a catheterization procedure. Women are sicker by the time they are referred.  
  
Women usually are diagnosed at an older age with poor ventricular function.  
Post CABG, they usually have a longer intubation and length of hospital stay.  
The ratio of female patients to all CABG female patients is about 30% in western countries.  
  
Men were considerably more likely to get a CABG procedure than women, 70.6% vs. 29.4%, respectively.  
  
Outcomes are better for women than for men on off-Pump CABGs, but worse for on-Pump procedures.  
  
For mortality, 1.47 on-pump (P=0.001) versus 1.27 off-pump (P=0.10).  
For myocardial infarction, 1.23 on-pump (P=0.18) versus 1.18 offpump (P=0.42).  
  
For major adverse cardiac events, 1.32 on-pump (P<0.001) versus 1.30 off-pump (P=0.01).  
For renal failure, 0.65 on-pump (P<0.001) versus 0.53 off-pump (P<0.001).  
For deep sternal infection, 0.98 on-pump (P=0.96) versus 0.77 offpump (P=0.47).  
For reoperation, 1.00 on-pump (P=0.96) versus 0.83 off-pump (P=0.04).  
  
For atrial fibrillation, 1.03 on-pump (P=0.56) versus 0.98 offpump (P=0.67).  
For postoperative hospitalization duration 14 days or more, 1.16 on-pump (P=0.04) versus 1.05 off-pump (P=0.59)  
  
The only exception was stroke, for which off-pump procedures had a higher risk for women versus men compared with on-pump bypass surgery (risk-adjusted OR 1.56 versus 1.20).
