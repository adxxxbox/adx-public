### Epidural Advantages and Disadvantages

  
_Edited by LCDR Lou Grass, MSN, CRNA – US Navy_

Advantages of Epidurals  
Allows for intermittent dosing or extended block when needed  
Allows for a slower onset if comorbidities require it  
Provides a lower incidence of hypotension after administration  
Allows the use of the epidural catheter for postoperative analgesia  
Allows more rapid return of gastrointestinal function than with general anesthesia.  
Results in fewer pulmonary complications compared to general anesthesia.  
Decreases incidence of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary emboli formation compared to general anesthesia.  
  
**Disadvantages of Epidurals  
Risk of block failure**  
The rate of failure is slightly higher than with a spinal anesthetic. Always be prepared to induce general anesthesia if block failure occurs.  
  
**Slower Onset**  
Onset is slower than with spinal anesthesia. May not be a good technique if the surgeon is impatient or there is little time to properly perform the procedure.  
  
**Hemodynamic Changes  
**Normal alteration in the patient’s blood pressure and potentially heart rate (generally slower onset with less alteration in blood pressure and heart rate than with a spinal anesthetic). It is essential to place the epidural block in the operating room/preoperative area with monitoring of an ECG, blood pressure, and pulse oximetry. Resuscitation medications/equipment should be available.  
_Continuous epidural catheters should not be used on the ward if the patient’s vital signs are NOT closely monitored._  
  
**Risk of complications  
**There is an increase in the complication rate compared to spinal anesthesia.  
See “Epidural Complications”  
  
**Risk for infection,** resulting in serious complications.
