Factor Xa Inhibitors    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Factor Xa Inhibitors (with some II inhibition)

**Heparin group/glycosaminoglycans (bind to Antithrombin)  
  
Direct Xa Inhibitors (xabans)  
  
Consist of:** Heparin, LMWHs and Direct Xa Inhibitors  
  
**Heparin (unfractionated) UF  
  
Low Molecular Weight Heparin (end in “parin”) (Fractionated)  
**Enoxaparin (Lovenox)  
Daltaparin (Fragmin)  
Tinziparin (Innohep)  
Bemiparin  
Certoparin  
Nadroparin  
Pamaparin  
Reviparin  
Tinziparin  
  
**LMWH Monitoring:** aPTT and/or Anti Factor Xa Activity (LMWXA)**aPTT:** Only slightly affected  
  
**LMWH Antidote: Protamine,** only neutralizes approximately 60% of LMWH’s anti‐ factor Xa activity.  
  
**Oligosaccharides:  
**Fondaparinux–may also be considered a Factor Xa inhibitor  
Idraparinux  
  
**Heparinoids  
**Danaparoid  
Dermatan sulfate  
Sulodexide**  
  
Direct Xa Inhibitors (end with “xaban”)**  
Apaxiban (Eliquis)  
Rivaroxaban (Xarelto)  
Betrixaban  
Darexaban  
Edoxaban  
Otamixaban  
  
Treatment options for Factor X deficiencies include factor X concentrate, fresh frozen plasma, and prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs).  
  
**Direct Xa Inhibitors Monitoring**  
**Specific Anti-Xa assay:** is most reliable  
**Normal antifactor Xa assay:** indicates no anticoagulation effect.  
**Elevated PT:** Apixaban is present, but no linear correlation  
**Normal PT:** Minimal drug effect  
**Elevated aPTT and INR:** Apixaban is present, but no linear correlation  
  
**Antidote:** None**Reversal:** Blood products as needed  
  
**Quick Review  
Factor X (** Stuart-Power factor)  
Factor X is vitamin K–dependent and serves as the first enzyme in the common pathway of thrombus formation. When activated, it converts prothrombin to thrombin.  
  
**Activated Factor X (Xa)**  
Factor Xa is a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein that converts prothrombin to thrombin in the presence of factor Va, calcium and phospholipid during blood clotting.
