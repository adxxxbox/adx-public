Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) Notes   

### Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) Notes

_By Dina Velocci CRNA_

Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening condition that typically affects the intestine of premature infants. The intestinal wall becomes infected and severely inflamed. The exact cause is not known. If not successfully treated in time, the intestinal wall can perforate, leading to peritonitis, sepsis and death.

**Quick Facts about NEC**  
Affects 1 in 2,000-4,000 births  
Affects between 1-5% of NICU admissions  
Usual onset is within the first 2-3 weeks of life in a premature infant (<36 weeks)  
The age of onset is inversely related to gestational age at birth  
NEC is rare in full-term infants, but develops within the first few days if at all  
More common in formula-fed than breastfed babies  
Affects close to 10% of neonates who weigh less than 1500 grams  
Mortality rates can be > 50%  
Common after a gastroschisis repair

**General Review**  
NEC becomes the immediate presumptive diagnosis whenever a baby in the NICU stops tolerating feeds and develops abdominal distension, bilious vomiting, and occasionally bloody stools.  
Feedings are immediately stopped, and an OGT is inserted to decompress the abdomen.  
Fluids and antibiotics are administered intravenously only. Serial blood counts and radiographic studies are monitored.  
  
NEC often resolves within 5-7 days from the above treatment. If not, the patient may progress to sepsis requiring intubation and vasopressors. The affected area may perforate, requiring an emergency open laparotomy with possible colon resection. These procedures are usually performed in the NICU and not in the OR. The two most common indicators for surgery are pneumoperitoneum on x-ray and clinical deterioration.  
  

**Bell’s Stages of NEC**  
**Stage I** (suspected disease): mild systemic signs (apnea, bradycardia, temperature instability), mild GI signs (abdominal distention, large gastric aspirates, bloody stools), non-specific or normal radiological signs

**Stage II** (definite disease): mild systemic signs with additional GI signs (absent bowel sounds, abdominal tenderness), specific radiological signs (dilated loops of intestines, pneumatosis intestinalis or portal venous air), abnormal laboratory investigations show a metabolic acidosis, thrombocytopenia

**Stage III** (advanced disease): severe systemic illness (with hemodynamic instability), additional GI signs (gross abdominal distention, peritonitis), severe radiological signs (pneumoperitoneum), additional laboratory findings reveal both a metabolic and respiratory acidosis, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy

**  
Relevant Lab Findings**  
WBC: neutropenia (neutrophil count < 1500/μL) suggests sepsis

H/H: decreased due to hematochezia or coagulopathy; increase due to hemoconcentration from fluid extravasation

Platelet count: decreased

Blood cultures are usually negative

Hyponatremia: a serum level < 130 mEq/dL is alarming

Low serum bicarbonate (< 20) may be present with poor tissue perfusion, sepsis, and bowel necrosis

**Infants at higher risk of the condition include:**  
Premature infants

Infants who are fed concentrated formulas

Infants in a nursery where an outbreak has occurred

Infants who have received exchange transfusions

Malabsorption syndrome may eventually occur for those children who have survived NEC and intestinal resections from the loss of a large segment of intestine.  
  
Some infants lose so much intestine to NEC and resulting colon resections that they cannot survive without a bowel transplant.

**Slow enteral feeding is associated with a reduced risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in smallest preterm infants:**

In a study of extremely low birth weight infants, standardized slow enteral feeding (SSEF) was associated with a reduced risk of NEC compared with early enteral feeding.  
  
**Initial NEC symptoms can include one or more of the following:**  
Vomiting  
Diarrhea  
Delayed gastric emptying  
Abdominal distention, abdominal tenderness, or both  
Ileus/decreased bowel sounds  
Abdominal wall erythema (advanced stages)  
Hematochezia  
Systemic signs are nonspecific and can include any combination of the following:  
Apnea  
Lethargy  
Decreased peripheral perfusion  
Shock (in advanced stages)  
Cardiovascular collapse.  
Bleeding diathesis (consumption coagulopathy)  
A breath hydrogen test may be positive.  
Arterial blood gas levels may indicate the infant's need for respiratory support and can provide information on the acid-base status.

**Radiographic findings include the following:**  
Pneumatosis intestinalis – Pathognomonic of NEC.  
Abdominal free air – meaning perforation and require emergency surgery  
Portal gas – A poor prognostic sign  
Distended loops of small bowel – Common but nonspecific  
Intraperitoneal free fluid

**Abdominal ultrasound:**  
Have available at bedside  
Can identify areas of loculation and/or abscesses consistent with a walled-off perforation  
Excellent for identifying and quantifying ascites
