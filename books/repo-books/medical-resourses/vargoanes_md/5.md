### IV Access and Information

Lines are most often inserted in a pre-op area, but they are sometimes inserted in the operating room. Caution should be exercised to limit rate of infusion to avoid excessive hydration. Most patient’s should be kept dry prior to bypass.  
  
**Always provide sedation.**  
  
**Catheters**  
2 large peripheral IVs 18-16g: lactated ringer’s infusion.  
Arterial line.  
Pulmonary Artery Catheter.  
Trauma line or a Cordis sheath.  
  
**PA Line Ports**  
**White** – connect to trifurcate (“crow’s foot”): phenylephrine, nitroglycerine and lactated ringer’s.  
**Brown** to CVP  
**Blue** to PA  
  
Connect main blood tubing to trauma line or Cordis sheath.  
  
Prepare two blood sets: one on fluid warmer, one to trauma line.
