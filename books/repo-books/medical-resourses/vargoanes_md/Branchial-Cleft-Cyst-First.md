Branchial Cleft Cyst (First) and Anesthesia   

## Branchial Cleft Cyst (First) and Anesthesia

_Anesthesia wise, this procedure is a basic neck procedure with the head positioned for optimal neck exposure using a General Anesthetic with an ETT or LMA._

A first branchial cyst has a tract closely associated to the facial nerve. It is highly variable and the surgeon may use a neurosurgical stimulator to clearly identify the facial nerve.  
  
**First branchial cleft cysts are divided into type I and type II.**  
**Type I cleft cysts:** Considered to be a duplication of the cartilaginous external auditory canal. It usually passes lateral to the facial nerve and ends at the bony meatus. No external opening is present except after infection.They are located near the external auditory canal. Most commonly, they are inferior and posterior to the tragus (base of the ear), but they may also be in the parotid gland.

  
**Type II cleft cysts:** Considered to be a duplication of the cartilaginous external auditory canal and pinna. If it is a sinus, it passes from an external opening high in the neck along the anterior border of sternocleidomastoid muscle, superficial or deep to the facial nerve in close relation to the parotid gland. They appear at the angle of the mandible and may involve the submandibular gland.

**Symptoms:**

Intermittent or continuous mucous discharge.

Recurrent attacks of inflammation.

Frank cellulitis or abscess formation may occur, requiring an incision and drainage.

**Diagnosis:**

Fistulogram will show if there is a tract extending from the opening in the neck. It displays length and the location of the tract.

X-ray  
CT Scan.  
MRI  
Ultrasound  
  
**Indications for Treatment:**

Infection

Mass effect (dysphagia, dyspnea, pain).

Cosmetic  
  

**Treatment** is a complete surgical excision.

  
**Surgical Procedure of a first branchial cyst:**

Skin incision is done over the cyst. The subplatysmal layer is elevated. The sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) muscle is retracted away, attempting to not injure the greater auricular nerve. The cyst is carefully separated from the surrounding structures without damaging the wall. After complete excision, the wound is closed.  
  
Care must be taken to avoid damaging the facial nerve when there is a tract leading up to or into the external auditory meatus. Sometimes the deep or superficial lobes of the parotid gland must be mobilized.

**Age Range:** Neonate – Adult.

**Anesthetic:** General/ ETT or LMA, but still check with the surgeon.  
**Airway:** The neck may be swollen and inflamed from infection, but usually not enough to impede the airway. Always assess.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Ask the surgeon if he/she plans on using a neurostimulator to clearly identify the facial or other nerves.  
**Position:** Supine, with arms to the side. Shoulder roll with donut beneath the cranium so that the neck is extended. Head of bed is raised slightly to decrease venous blood pressure in the head and neck. The chin is turned away from the operative side.  
**A-line:** Not needed.  
**IV Access:** One good flowing IV that is age appropriate. Large bore not required.

**Hydration: 4:2:1** (below is just a common reference)Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**Contraindications:**

Acute infection (treat prior to excision).

Medical contraindication to elective surgery.

**Possible Complications:  
**Wound infection.

Cyst recurrence.  
Hemorrhage of Carotid or other vessels.  
Damage to adjacent facial nerve in cases where the tract leads up to or into the external auditory meatus.

Damage to the hypoglossal, vagus and linguinal nerves.

Damage to the superficial lobes of the parotid glands.
