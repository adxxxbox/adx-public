### Parathyroid Review Notes

**![](PTHrev.png)**

The parathyroid glands are rice-sized and located on the back of the thyroid gland.  
The vast majority of patients have a total of 4 parathyroid glands: 2 superior and 2 inferior. However, the exact number may vary from 3-7 glands.A fifth or sixth gland may be located in an aberrant place such as the chest (ectopic parathyroid). If this occurs, the hyperparathyroidism may not be corrected with one operation, and rarely a second procedure may be required to find all of the patient's remaining parathyroid gland tissue. Accidental removal of 3 of the 4 glands may cause transient hypoparathyroidism.  
**Function of the Parathyroid Glands  
Function:** Calcium homeostasis.**Calcitonin:** Released from the thyroid gland and reduces blood calcium level via osteoblastic activity.  
**Parathyroid hormone or PTH:** Released from the parathyroid gland and causes an increase in blood Ca via osteoclast activation.  
PTH is released in response to a low serum concentration of ionized calcium.  
The release of PTH is inhibited by an increase in serum-ionized calcium.  
PTH causes the kidneys to increase the tubular resorption of calcium and decrease the resorption of phosphorus. PTH also acts on bone and the intestine to increase serum calcium levels.  
  
**Hypocalcemic Tetany:** A complication of hypocalcemia  
When Ca levels fall 50% below normal.  
That’s less Calcium to block Sodium channels, leading to hypopolarization.Normal Ca = 8-10mg/dL.  
If the patient’s Ca level drops < 6, they become prone to tetany.  
An example would be a carpal pedal spasm of the hand elbow and possibly stridor.  
  
Most parathyroidectomies are for primary hyperparathyroidism.  
80-90% of these cases are from parathyroid adenomas.  
Most adenomas are not genetic but sporadic, and they involve all parathyroid glands equally.  
Between 5% and 15% of cases of primary parathyroid hyperplasia involve 4-gland hyperplasia.  
Parathyroid cancer is rare and accounts for less than 1% of cases of primary hyperparathyroidism.In patients with hyperparathyroidism, one or more parathyroid glands become enlarged and secrete too much PTH, causing hypercalcemia.  
The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism requires a minimally increased serum total calcium level with an increased intact PTH level, or at least, inappropriately high normal PTH levels.
