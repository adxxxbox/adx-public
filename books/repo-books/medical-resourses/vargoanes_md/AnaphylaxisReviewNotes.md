### Anaphylaxis Review Notes (perioperative)  

(Anaphylaxis is fatal in 3% to 10% of surgical cases)

The first report of anaphylaxis was described in hieroglyphics in 2640 BC when an Egyptian pharaoh died after a wasp sting.

The term ‘anaphylaxis’ is derived from the Greek ‘ana’ meaning backward and ‘phylaxis’ meaning protection.

Anaphylaxis is the most severe generalized form of allergic reaction.

**How it all happens  
**A previous exposure to a foreign protein (antigen), may stimulate the production of antigen-specific IgE antibodies. Many IgE antibodies bind to the surface of mast cells and basophils. The mast cells and basophils are then primed to react the next time a person encounters the antigen. In reality, the IgE-coated mast cells and basophils are grenades of histamine, **_and with re-exposure, the antigen is_** equivalent to pulling out the grenade clip.

The reencountering antigen binds to the pre-loaded IgEs on the mast cell and basophil surface, triggering the release of potent inflammatory mediators — including histamine. **_Histamine is a vasoactive substance causing hypotension._**

These mediators induce an allergic response. The reaction may occur within seconds resulting a spectrum of reactions from mild to a full-blown anaphylactic shock and death.

**Why Muscle Relaxants and Other Meds Do Not Need Pre-Exposure**  
In anesthesia, muscle relaxants is one exception with an anaphylactic reaction not requiring a pre-exposure of an antigen (the muscle relaxant).  
In 80% of the reactions to with muscle relaxants, there had been NO previous history of use.  
The development of allergic cross-reactivity may be due to antibodies to allergens that have chemical families or molecular structures similar to those drugs.

The quaternary ammonium group found in neuromuscular blocking agents is widely present in cosmetics, personal products (toothpastes, soaps, and shampoos), chemical additives in foods (metabisulfites, preservatives), and drugs (cough medicines).

This could explain why anaphylaxis to neuromuscular blocking agents is five to ten times more common than other drugs.

Most nondepolarizing muscle blocking agents also directly stimulate histamine release. Muscle relaxants, in particular the aminosteroids may bind with biologic proteins, creating a hapten molecule that is recognized as an antigen.

**Drug reactions caused by neuromuscular blocking agents  
(Some of the literature drastically varies)  
**Succinylcholine 33-43%  
Rocuronium 29%  
Vecuronium 10-37%  
Atracurium 7-19%

**Cross Sensitivity When Allergic to Muscle Relaxants  
**Cross-reactivity is a problem with muscle relaxants and at least 60% of those allergic to one muscle relaxant may react to another**.**

**Onset Time of Anaphylaxis  
**Onset of an anaphylaxis may take seconds - 2 hours.  
However, with anesthesia, most of the time it occurs 30 – 60 minutes after the start of induction with general anesthesia, rather than at induction.

**Anaphylaxis incidence (**occurring during anesthesia)between 1/1000 and 1/25,0000 procedures (literature varies).  
Overall, less than 2% of the population per year experiences anaphylaxis.

Anaphylaxis due to any medication: 37/100,000 hospitalized patients.  
  
Perioperative anaphylaxis occurs equally in girls and boys, but is more common in women than men.

**Cardiac and Anaphylaxis**  
Patients with ischemic heart disease or dilated cardiomyopathy may have severe allergic reactions because of a greater density of myocardial mast cells.

Patients with cardiac conduction defects, increased vagal tone, or taking sympatholytic medications may not have tachycardia with anaphylaxis.

**Beta-Blockers and Anaphylaxis Treatment  
**Patients on beta-blockers may have an inadequate response to the administration of epinephrine when treating for anaphylaxis.

However on the flip side, patients taking beta-blockers can become severely hypertensive when epinephrine is administered because of unopposed alpha-adrenergic tone and reflex vagotonic effects.

**ACE inhibitors and Anaphylaxis  
**Patients on ACE inhibitors may have an increased severity of allergic reactions and also be LESS responsive to epinephrine when anaphylaxis treatment.  
  
An increased serum bradykinin level due to low serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels and decreased platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase levels may increase the risk of anaphylaxis. Patients taking angiotensin II blockers may also be resistant to epinephrine

**Mast Cell Diseases and Anaphylaxis**Patients with mastocytosis or clonal mast cell diseases can have exaggerated release of histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins during anesthesia.  
  
**Angioedema**  
Patients with hereditary or acquired angioedema that cause increased release of inflammatory mediators may also be sensitive to anesthesia.

**Test Dose  
Literature states that you should wait** at least 20 minutes after a small amount is given before administering a drug to a highly allergic patient. Unfortunately, most of us don’t.

There is a higher risk of death with a patient with asthma has an anaphylactic reaction.

Anaphylaxis is more common and severe in older patients who may have chronic pulmonary or cardiovascular disease.  
  
Although people with asthma are not at increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions, they are at higher risk of death if anaphylaxis occurs.

Patients with food allergies may have decreased levels of enzymes that degrade platelet-activating factor, increasing the risk of anaphylaxis.

**Most popular triggers:**  
Muscle relaxants 69%  
Antibiotics 15%  
Rubber (latex) 12.6 % -with kids  
Colloids around 4%  
Radiological contrast media (up to 3%)  
IV Dyes:Used for sentinel node biopsyBenzodiazepines (2%)  
Propofol: 1.2% and 1:15 000 anesthetics  
Opioids are uncommon  
Halogenated volatile anesthetics –none reported**  
  
Chlorhexidine** - Always allow any skin disinfectant to dry completely before inserting CVP and epidural catheters. There have been reports in ORs and ICUs during insertion

**Protamine** - Patients receiving protamine containing insulins (eg NPH) have a 10-30 fold increased risk for anaphylaxis to protamine when used for heparin reversal. but the actual incidence of anaphylaxis to protamine is only 0.6-2% in this patient population

**Esters and Amides  
**Although allergic reactions are rare with amides, cross-reactive sensitization is possible with esters.

**IV Administration and Anaphylaxis  
**Anaphylactic reactions are more common when drugs are given IV.

**Latex Cross-Sensitivity with Patients Allergic to the following Fruits  
**Banana  
Pears  
Kiwi  
Figs  
Mango  
Passion fruit  
Papaya

**Latex Cross-Sensitivity with Patients Allergic to the following Nuts:  
**Chestnuts  
Hazelnuts  
Walnuts  
Peanuts  
  
Avocado have been associated with latex cross-sensitivity  
  
The latex allergen is absorbed more slowly through the skin and mucosa; the symptoms of latex hypersensitivity may be delayed by 30 minutes after contact.

Latex powder from surgical gloves can be inhaled through the lungs and cause an anaphylactic reaction

**Propofol**  
Despite past literature, current evidence suggests that egg allergic patients are not more likely to develop anaphylaxis when exposed to propofol.  
Allergy to propofol was more likely in patients with a history of atopy (hyperallergic).  
The main allergen of egg is ovalbumin (found in the egg white), and the lecithin in propofol is derived from the egg yolk protein, which may explain the low incidence of propofol allergy. The soy and peanut oils in propofol are refined to eliminate allergenic proteins.

**Opioids**  
Opioids are more likely to cause a reaction from the direct release of histamine than from IgE reaction. Demorol and morphine are the most histamine-stimulating narcotics stimulating the dermal mast cells, resulting in flushing or urticaria.  
  
**Glycopyrrolate:** Rare but has been reported

**Aminosteroid vs Benzylisoquinoline Muscle Relaxants  
**Aminosteroid muscle relaxants cause anaphylactic reactions  
Benzylisoquinolines tend to cause anaphylactoid reactions

**Aminosteroid muscle relaxants** (Rocuronium, Vecuronium and Pancuronium)  
**Benzylisoquinoline Muscle Relaxants** (atracurium and cisatracurium)

**Inflammatory Mediators released from Mast cells and Basophils  
**Histamine, proteases (among which is tryptase), leukotrienes, and prostaglandins elicit immediate symptoms such as pruritis, wheezing, or hypotension, and can induce cardiovascular collapse.

**The Inflammatory Mediators released from Cardiac Mast Cells**  
**Cysteinyl leukotrienes and prostaglandins-** decrease myocardial perfusion and contractility.  
**Platelet-activating factor-** can constrict the coronary arteries, decrease coronary perfusion and contractility, and can contribute to coronary plaque rupture.

Cardiac Mast Cells can release chymase and carboxypepidase, which activate the renin- angiotensin system.

**Mediators and their effects**  
**Histamine:**  
H1 - Mucus secretion, edema, cardiac depression, coronary vasoconstriction , and renin release  
H2 - Gastric acid secretion, nitrous oxide induction, VD and tachycardia  
H3 - Decrease in norepinephrine levels  
H4 - Inflammation  
  
**Heparin:** Anticoagulation, activates prekallikrein and contact systems and  
increased bradykinin.  
  
**Tryptase:** Activates prekallikrein and complement, bradykinin and anaphylatoxins.  
**Chymase:** Renin production, compensatory norepinephrine secretion, dysrhythmias.  
**Carboxypeptidase A:** Prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis and inflammation.

**Platelet-activating factor may cause:**  
Bronchoconstriction  
Decreased coronary blood flow and contractility  
Nitric oxide induction  
Vasodilatation  
Hypotension  
Platelet aggregation  
Recruitment of neutrophils and eosinophils  
Anticoagulation  
  
**Prostaglandin D2 may cause:**  
Bronchoconstriction  
Pulmonary and coronary vasoconstriction  
Peripheral vasodilatation  
Vascular permeability  
Hypotension  
Flushing  
Urticaria  
  
**Leukotriene LTC 4 may cause  
**Bronchoconstriction  
Airway remodeling  
Angioedema  
Nitric oxide induction  
Increased vascular permeability  
Hypotension  
  
**Kallikrein may cause:**  
Renin production  
Complement activation  
Fibrinolysis  
Clotting  
  
**Tumor Necrosis Factor:** Neutrophil activation, chemokines, cytokines, and effector cell recruitment.  
  
**Severity Scale of Anaphylaxis  
(Grades III and IV are life threatening)  
**The severity of anaphylaxis symptoms is rated by using the Ring and Messmer severity scale

**Mild Grade I** reactions: show cutaneous or mucosal signs  
**  
Moderated Grade II reaction:** A moderate grade II reaction can result in multiorgan involvement with possible cutaneous signs and cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal symptoms.  
  
**Severe Grade III:** Cardiovascular collapse and profound hypotension leading to inadequate tissue perfusion and arrhythmias, bronchospasm and hypoxia with an SaO2 < 92 are common.  
GI distress or incontinence may occur.  
Death can occur

**Critical Grade IV:** PEA or cardiac arrest  
  
**_Differential Diagnoses_**  
**The cardiovascular symptoms may be misdiagnosed as:**  
Anesthetic overdose  
Dysrhythmias  
Hypovolemia or hemorrhage,  
Gas embolism  
Vasovagal reaction  
Pericardial tamponade  
Septic or cardiogenic shock  
  
Rapid IV administration of vancomycin may cause symptoms similar to those of anaphylaxis.

Preoperative benzodiazepines are indicated for highly allergic patients because stress can lead to mast cell degranulation

**Antibiotics**  
In general (nonsurgical) the most common triggers for anaphylaxis are antibiotics (especially Beta-lactam). Cephalosporins and penicillis are Beta-Lacams.  
Also, vancomycin, and quinolone antibiotics and irrigation with bacitracin or rifamycin have also elicited hypersensitivity reactions.

**How long is the Duration of an Anaphylactic Reaction?  
**Anaphylaxis usually resolves in 2–8 h but secondary complications may prolong this. Recovery is usually complete except when cerebral hypoxia at the peak caused brain damage, or when DIC occurred.

**Adults may experience more severe reactions due to the following:  
**Use of β-blocking agents or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors

Existence of comorbid conditions such as heart disease

When exposure to a variety of therapeutic and diagnostic agents  
Occupational exposures, such as latex anaphylaxis, especially healthcare workers

Patients with food anaphylaxis
