### Epididymectomy

Is removal of the epididymis through a transverse scrotal incision. The epididymis connects the testicle to the vas deferens.  
**Indications:**  
Chronic epididymitis, long-term inflammation of the epididymis, and for men with complex epididymal cystic disease.  
**Anesthetic:** Deep MAC or General/LMA  
Spinal-rare  
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes  
**Position:** Supine or frog-legged. Lithotomy as well; surgeon’s preference.  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**Vagal Bradycardia:** Pulling of the genitals can cause a sudden bradycardia. Just be aware and prepare.

**Possible Complications**  
Loss of a testicle from complications.  
Wound infection.  
Bleeding  
Chronic pain in the testicle.  
A reduction in sperm count.  
Extremely rarely- a disturbance to the blood supply resulting in the loss of the testicle.

**More Notes:**  
Epididymis is an essential part of the male reproductive system.  It is a structure located inside the scrotum, which is attached to the posterior side of the testis, and is connected with the vas deferens, which in turn is connected with the urethra. The epididymis is important in the storage, maturation and transport of sperm.
