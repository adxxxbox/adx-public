### Thymectomy- Robotic

**(Da Vinci; Right Chest Approach)**  
The total incision is less than one inch. Cutting of the sternum and spreading of the ribs are not required. This procedure now takes about two hours and most patients go home in less than 24 hours.  
**Anesthetic:** General/DLT with the right lung dropped.  
**Muscle Relaxants:** Does the patient have Myasthenia gravis (MG)?  
Ok to relax if there is no MG present.  
**Positioning:** Supine or slightly right side up. Right arm abducted back and out of the way, giving full exposure to the right axillary area.  
**Thoracic Epidural:** Not common.  
**IV Access:** 2 18G IVs  
**A-line:** Usually  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours.  
**EBL:** 50-100 mLs.

**Possible Complications:**   
Hemorrhage  
Postoperative bleeding  
Phrenic Nerve Injury  
Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury  
Mediastinitis

If the thymoma invades into the mediastinum, an en bloc resection is recommended. Thymic carcinomas and thymic carcinoids have poor prognoses, regardless of the stage of the lesion.
