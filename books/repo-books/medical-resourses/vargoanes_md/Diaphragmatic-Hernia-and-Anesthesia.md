Diaphragm Repair has been traditionally achieved through an abdominal incision to reduce the problem of abdominal contents moving into the thorax. Most of the time, the diaphragmatic defect is repaired using a prosthetic patch and the incision is closed on the first attempt. Sometimes there is not enough space to close the wound and an abdominal silo is temporarily placed.

  
Minimally invasive (laparoscopic) surgical repair has been performed in older children and adults with Chronic Diaphragmatic Hernia, or CDH.

Laparoscopic repair with neonates is becoming more popular, despite the literature sources noting that Neonates are often unable to tolerate the adverse physiological effects of the CO2 insufflation.  
However, many surgeons are performing minimally invasive repairs because infants are also known to be very resilient to the physiologic effects of intrathoracic insufflation. The respiratory acidosis can usually be managed with hyperventilation.

**Incision:** Abdominal or Left thoracoabdominal

**Goals:  
**Avoid hypoxemia, hypothermia and acidosis because they all increase pulmonary vasoconstriction.

**Preoperatively:  
**You need to find out the following:  
Is it an EARLY or LATE diaphragmatic hernia?  
**Late hernias** develop late and the neonate’s lungs are usually normally developed and healthy. They present as a bowel obstruction.**Early herniation** :  
Aplastic lung is common

You do not extubate these patients.  
Is there an A-line? (Right radial is pre-ductal)  
Is there an Umbilical artery line? (post-ductal)

Is there a central line?  
What were the vent settings and last ABG results?  
Chest Tubes?

Inhaled nitric oxide, or iNO? Usually not; it is rare for these.  
Cardiac Drips?  
Are they on ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation, or ECMO?

**Other prepared meds:**  
Epi syringes (diluted) 1mcg and 10mcg/cc  
Atropine (0.01 - 0.02mg/kg)  
Flush syringes

The neonate is transported from NICU intubated and paralyzed. They should also have an A-line, Central Line and NGT/OGT.  
  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT and muscle relaxation  
**Induction:** Gentle mask ventilation (to assist only) if not already intubated.  
If not already intubated- RSI. If the patient’s vitals signs are appropriate, administer narcotics with induction to avoid stimulating the sympathetic system, which increases pulmonary HTN.

**Intubation:** Already intubated from the NICU.  
**Position:** Supine  
**Nitrous Oxide:** No, it could expand the bowel and can also decrease PaO2.  
**Muscle Relaxant:** Vecuronium and Rocuronium are common. Avoid Pavulon because of its intrinsic sympathomimetic properties.  
**Ventilation Settings:**  
Maintain SaO2\- preductal 90-95%

Keep CO2 normal to slightly elevated (permissive hypercarbia).

Avoid hypoxemia, hypothermia and acidosis because they all increase pulmonary vasoconstriction leading to a right-to-left shunt.

Avoid high PIPs (<30cmH20)

**Ventilation Note:** With an aplastic lung present, it is common to over ventilate in attempt to achieve normocapnia. As a result, the development of a contralateral pneumothorax (in the healthy lung) is common.

Utilize high ventilation rates with low tidal volumes. Monitor for sudden increase in PIPs and hemodynamic changes. Surgeon may have to emergently place a chest tube.  
Sometimes an RRT will bring down the HFOV (High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation) to the operating room.

**EBL-** Usually minimal  
**Type and Screen:** Yes, just in case of hemorrhage.  
**Fluids:** NS/LR @ 4ml/kg/h maintenance

Sometimes these patients are fluid restricted in the NICU.  
Continue dextrose containing fluid from NICU.

**IV Access:** If umbilicus venous line is no longer present, hook your drips to a peripheral IV.

**Hydration: 4:2:1** **(below is just a common reference)**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

Central Access in those with left sided hernias may be needed

**A-Line:** Yes (umbilical or radial) 24G. A Right radial (pre-ductal) is better.  
Pulse ox–post ductal left hand.

**ABGs during the case:** Absolutely  
**Acute Desaturations:** Check for a pneumothorax on the unaffected side; don’t try to aggressively manually ventilate and do keep PIPs < 30cmH20 when possible.

**Sudden Pulmonary Hypertensive Crisis:** Always be prepared.  
**Treat with:**  
Moderate hyperventilation (often with manual bagging)  
Pulmonary vasodilator- iNO (decreases right to left shunting and provides pulmonary dilatation).  
100% O2  
Maintain adequate preload.  
Albumin, PRBCs or other fluids can be given through the umbilicus artery line.  
**Inotropic Support:** Epinephrine, dopamine or Milrinone.

**NG Tube:** Do not remove it and/or connect it to suction. It was placed to minimize distention of the intrathoracic viscera. It will be more difficult to ventilate when intrathoracic viscera start to re-expand.

**Regional:** Some literature will mention inserting caudal epidurals and advancing it to the thoracic space instead of using narcotics. This is very rare.  
  

**When the surgeon is closing the incision** : You need to watch for increases in the PIPs. Inform the surgeon if the PIPs dramatically increases or the patient becomes difficult to ventilate. These unhealthy changes may lead the surgeon to consider not closing the incision.

  
**Possible complications:**  
Pneumothorax  
Hypoventilation  
Hypothermia  
Metabolic acidosis  
R-to-L shunting  
CHF

Hemorrhage

**If on ECMO:**

You can give relaxants and high dose narcotics through the ECMO circuit. Ask the ECMO tech. Remember the circuit is heparinized to keep the oxygenator from clotting off, so there will be more bleeding. The ECMO techs monitor the patient’s ACTS.

**Anesthesia concerns:**  
(1) Hypoxemia and hypotension caused by over distention of the stomach and herniation across the thoracic midline.

(2) Hypoxemia due to primary pulmonary hypoplasia.  
(3) Hypoxemia due to Pulmonary Hypertension.  
(4) Pneumothorax of the contralateral lung during attempts at high-pressure ventilation.  
(5) Systemic hypotension caused by kinking of major blood vessels, particularly those of the liver.

Sometimes the neonate is still on ECMO or HFOV (High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation) from the ICU and the repair can be done in the NICU.
