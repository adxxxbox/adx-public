### Descending Thoracic Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm(TAAA) Notes (Thoracoabdominal)

The descending thoracic aorta begins distal to the left subclavian and ends at the diaphragm.  
TAAs: 5 per 1,000 people.  
This is a big case with sometimes a 10 liter blood loss. You better have your game on.  
Aneurysms are usually asymptomatic.  
**Causes:** Atherosclerosis, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, dissection, infection including syphilis.  
**Incision:** left lateral thoracotomy  
**Bypass Machine:** sometimes, but usually not.  
  
**Thoracoabdomial aneurysms are classified by Crawford into four types.**

**Type 1:** Includes most of the descending thoracic aorta and upper abdominal aorta (suprarenal). Around 50% belong in this category.

**Type 2**: Most of the descending thoracic aorta and most of abdominal aorta.

**Type 3**: Lower portion of the descending thoracic aorta and most of abdominal aorta (including renal and visceral arteries).

**Type 4**: Most or the entire abdominal aorta.

**Managing a TAAA repair differs from an open AAA in three major ways:**

TAAA requires a DLT for single lung ventilation.  
There is much more blood loss than an open AAA.

More risk of Paraplegia from prolonged ischemia or resection of the great radicular artery (Artery of Adamkiewicz).  
  
Find out ahead of time which technique below the surgeon is going to use.

1.**“Clamp and sew”** –The aorta is clamped above (proximally).  Surgeons anastamose as fast as possible. Goal is clamp time  <30min. During clamp time, there can be a large blood loss from back bleeding of the intercostals, mesenteric, renal and iliac arteries.

2.**Partial Bypass**/**shunts-** Heart remains beating, blood is partially diverted from the left atrium or proximal aorta distally to one of the femoral arteries (Femoral artery cannula flowing cephalad). This bypass set up does not have an oxygenator.

This technique relies on lung function, cardiac function and volume status.

3.**CPB (cardiopulmonary bypass**)-Distal to aortic clamp. The patient’s lower body circulation is perfused via femoral vein to femoral artery bypass (Femoral artery and vein is cannulated).

Whenever the subclavian artery or aortic arch is involved, it will require CPB.

**Note:** With CPB, there is much less EBL.

**Pre Op**

Cardiac workup. If they don’t have one, treat them like a CAD patient. Many of these patients have CAD.

Check CXR or CT for left mainstem bronchus compression by the aneurysm. If present, placement of Left DLT might be difficult. You may end up using a bronchial blocker and/or right sided double lumen tube.

Hoarse voice may indicative of aneurysm induced recurrent laryngeal nerve dysfunction

**Type and Crossed:** Yes

**Blood Products:**  
Around 10 units PRBC’s available, maintain an HCT > 25-30  
Around 10 units of FFP  
2-4 Platelets (5 packs)  
Remember PRBC’s don’t have clotting factors so you need to also give FFP and Platelets  
0 negative Blood if its emergency

**Cell Saver:** Yes

**Lines and Monitoring (Sedate and avoid hypertension)**

Largest bore peripheral IVs as possible (14G if possible).

One or more introducers, Left or Right IJ, or femoral veins.

TEE instead of a swan. You can use one more introducer without a swan.

If needed, a pulmonary artery catheter can be inserted for postoperative management at the end of the case.

With partial bypass/shunting is used, the primary focus for the perfusionist is to adequately perfuse the upper and lower body.

A TEE provides constant evaluation of LV filling status.

**Fluid Warmers:** 2-3

**Rapid Transfuser or pressure bags:** yes

**Blood Transfusion Tubing:** 2  
**A-line:** Yes

**Right radial A-line** –Because the surgeon might clamp proximal or near the left subclavian artery. A left A-line would be useless.

A dorsal pedal or femoral arterial line to monitor distal pressures if using bypass can be used.

**Anesthetic:** General/RSI/ETT   
**NG Tube:** Yes, empty the stomach after intubation before the TEE.  It enhances the TEE exam.

**Induction/ Intubation:**  
Use a DLT and LTA kit (collapse the left lung)  
  
**Methods to avoid hypertension with direct laryngoscopy:**

Consider adding Esmolol with induction to blunt a spike in BP.  
Consider Remifentanil, start at 0.5-1mcg/kg/min 8 minutes prior to intubating.  
Consider high narcotic induction dose-like a heart.  
Consider using a Glide Scope. It is less stimulating.  
  
**Common Induction Dose:**  
RSI-treat like a full stomach

Anectine and Etomidate  
Versed: 5mg  
Fentanyl: 20mLs  
  
Left DLT if the aneurysm compresses the left main stem bronchus.  
   

**Position**  
You need to ask the surgeon where he/she is going to cannulate.     
Lateral Position with the bed flexed (head and feet downwards). We use a bean bag-bumped to right side-arms turned.

**Induction to PRE-CLAMP PERIOD**  
If an acute dissection is present, a large blood volume may be sequestered in the aortic wall. May need to give blood early.

Avoid HTN-don’t want to rupture the aneurysm.

0.5-1.0 g/kg of Mannitol (usually (12.5-25g) 30 minutes before cross clamping.  
Have Lasix available.

**Low Dose Heparin:** Some surgeons prefer it for preventing thrombosis of the lower extremities.

If using complete bypass (CPB) a full dose of heparin (300 U/kg)- just like a heart.

**PREPARATION FOR AORTIC CROSS CLAMPING WITHOUT BYPASS**

Nitroglycerine, and/or Milrinone should be connected and available.

In the absence of bypass, keep SBP 180-200mmHg once the patient is clamped.

**Remember:** High blood pressures are needed to perfuse the organs clamped distally (relying on collaterals). So we don’t want to compromise the kidneys and spine!

CaCl is commonly administered for post transfusion hypocalcemia. Check Ionized Ca levels.

**PREPARATION FOR AORTIC CROSS CLAMP WITH BYPASS**

Bypass is slowly initially before cross clamping, preventing significant effects on blood pressure with clamp placement. Proximal pressure drops are usually secondary to excessive left atrial drainage and subsequently inadequate LV filling. Flow rates must be temporarily decreased and slowly reestablished. Goals usually include distal mean pressures of about 50mmHg. Proximal mean pressures are ideally equal to the patient’s baseline.

**COMPLICATIONS OF AORTIC CROSS CLAMP PLACEMENT**

Two of the most concerning complications of aortic cross clamp placement are renal failure and paraplegia.

Incidence of ARF is 3-14%; if subsequent dialysis is required, mortality rate is 30-60%.

Increased Risk of Renal Failure When:

Preexisting renal disease

 >30 minutes cross clamp time

Hypovolemia and decreased CO when not using partial or complete bypass

**Renal Protection**

Mannitol, Lasix, Dopamine and/or Fenoldopam can be used.

Mannitol is the most important. 12.5 or 25G is most common.  
Mannitol dose: 0.5-1.0 g/kg prior to aortic cross clamping.

**SPINAL CORD PROTECTION**

The Paraplegia rate can double with a dissected aneurysm.

**Some Techniques for Spinal Cord Protection:**

Steroids-1 gram Solu Medrol

Magnesium

Intrathecal papaverine injection

Epidural cooling

Systematic hypothermia

CSF drainage through lumbar catheter

**Cerebral Spinal Fluid Drain**

Goal-decrease the CSF pressure to 10mmHg.

Cross clamp decreases distal systematic pressure

With the engorged dural veins, the CSF pressure can increase from 5 to 20-25mmHg.  
  
The minimal MAP for spinal cord auto regulation is 60-70 mmHg.

After clamping, distal MAP can drop to 30-60 mmHg.

MAP-CSF Pressure = Spinal Cord Perfusion Pressure.

So a drop in the MAP with a simultaneous increase in CSF Pressure can be devastating to spinal cord perfusion.

So by using this equation above, if we decrease the CSF Pressure to 10 from 20-25mmHg, this should double the Spinal Cord Perfusion Pressure.

A lumbar drain is place; it usually remains in place for 48-72 hours.

Maintain a CSF pressure of 10mm Hg via drainage.

Never remove drainage until coags are back to normal.

**Preparation for Removal of the Aortic Cross Clamp with Bypass.**  
The perfusionist will wean down the bypass-leaving more blood in the beating heart.  
This increases proximal pressure while the cross clamp is gradually released.  
Volume or pressors may initially be needed and blood products should be in the room and checked.  
At least two units of PRBC should be pressurized for infusion at cross clamp removal.  
Avoid HTN while the surgeons evaluate the anastomosis.

**Late Operative and Postoperative Considerations**

These patients frequently get facial, scalp, and airway edema.

With all the edema, extubation is not recommended (or ETT change) until the edema subsides. Elevate HOB over night helps.

You should deflate the bronchial cuff and place a piece of tape over the pilot balloon. Make sure you give the nurses those long suction catheters that come with the DLTs.

**Risk of spinal cord, renal and mesenteric ischemic injuries:**

Atherosclerosis accounts for approximately 95% of abdominal aneurysms. Spinal cord damage and renal impairment are special concerns, and obviously one lung anesthesia must be provided.  

**Reducing spinal cord ischemia:**

Best method is short cross clamp time (<30 min)

Maintain distal aortic perfusion pressure

Mild hypothermia

**CSF drainage:** controversial

Avoid hyperglycemia: Insulin drip if glucose >200
