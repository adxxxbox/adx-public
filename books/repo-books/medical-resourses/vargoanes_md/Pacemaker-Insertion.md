### Pacemaker Insertion

A minimally invasive procedure that usually does not involve anesthesia unless there is airway or conscious sedation concerns. Today, it appears we have more complicated high-risk patients that require our presence.

**Single chamber pacemakers:** Use one lead in either the RA or RV.

**Dual chamber pacemakers:** One lead in the RA and one in the RV.

**Procedure:**  
A small incision approximately 2 inches long will be made in the upper chest below the clavicle. A subcutaneous pocket is made for the pacemaker. Through the pocket, the cardiologist locates the subclavian vein and inserts a guide wire down into the RV of the heart. This is where you might see some PVCs until the guide wires or leads are repositioned. This is all done under fluoroscopy, so you will need a lead apron.

A lead may then be placed through the tricuspid valve into the RV for single-chamber pacing; or two leads may be placed, one into the right atrium and the other into the RV for dual-chamber pacing.  
After the ventricular and/or atrial leads are placed, the pacing lead will then be tested for sensing and pacing threshold, depolarization amplitude, and lead resistance. Testing the leads is not painful. Repositioning and retesting a pacing lead several times is not unusual during a pacemaker procedure.

Once the cardiologist is satisfied, the pacemaker generator unit is connected and placed in the aforementioned pocket and closed. You can stop sedation because the area of insertion is already numb from the initial local injection and infiltration.

**Anesthesia:** usually MAC, rarely General  
NC with ETCO2 sampling using the Salter cannula with oral and nasal airways readily available. PEC I block is an option to decrease the level of needed sedation.

**Note**: The only time you really need to deepen the patient is in the beginning during the local injection. This is NOT an AICD placement so there will be no shocking the patient at the end of the case.  
  
**Position:** Supine with arms to the side.

**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**IV Access:** 1 is ok.  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**Hydration:** Normovolemic  
**Foley:** Sometimes, but usually not

**Possible Complications:**  
**Pneumothorax** (may require a chest tube)  
**Pericarditis**  
**Perforation of the heart muscle**  
**Infection**  
**Hemothorax**  
**Air embolism**  
**Erosion of the pacer through the skin** (rare)

**Hematomas** (may require drainage)

**Lead dislodgment** - usually occurs within 2 days following implantation of a permanent pacer and may be seen on chest radiography (if the lead is floating freely in the ventricle, often malignant arrhythmias may develop).

**Venous thrombosis** - rare and usually presents as unilateral arm edema.

**Other Notes**  
**Indications for a Permanent Pacer**

Symptomatic bradycardia is the most common indication.  
Tachyarrhythmias

Acquired AV and fascicular blocks in adults

Sick sinus syndrome

Syncope and neurally mediated syndromes  
Heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy

More than 300,000 patients in the US receive a permanent pacemaker each year.

**Pacemaker Batteries**  
Most batteries last at least 5 years. Newer models are used today that allow a battery charge directly through the skin in about 5 minutes.

**Electrical Devices for pacemaker patients to avoid**

The following potential sources of strong electrical or magnetic fields that should be kept12 inches away from a Pacemaker:

Large stereo speakers  
Strong magnets (MRIs)  
Magnetic bingo wands or wands to sense surgical sponges with microchips.  
Magnetic wands and detectors used in airport security.
