Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) and Anesthesia    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) and Anesthesia

-   Also called “Total Hip Replacement.”
-   Consider reviewing “Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) Anatomy and Review”

**Pre-op**

-   Many patients are requiring THA are obese and elderly
-   Assess for the following associated comorbidities
    -   Cardiovascular disease
    -   OSA
    -   Diabetes

**Pre-op labs**

-   _BMP_ and _CBC_
-   _Serum glucose_ for obese and/or diabetic patients
    -   _Hemoglobin A1C_
    -   Inform the surgeon when the hemoglobin A1C is greater than 8%
    -   Many orthopedic surgeons cancel elective procedures due to the increased risk of infection and postpone the procedure until the patient can better manage their diabetes

**VTE prophylaxis:** Yes

**Anesthesia Techniques**

-   General/ETT
-   Regional: Spinal or Epidural
    -   +/- propofol infusion and ETC02 Monitoring
    -   Studies suggest a possible reduction in Operative Blood loss and better postoperative pain control
    -   Can be combined with GA (not common)
-   Postoperative pain control can be facilitated
    -   Preop Single shot or indwelling catheter (Q-Pump) facia iliaca block
    -   +/- intrathecal narcotics

  
**Positioning:** Lateral or supine (depends on surgical approach)  
**Duration:** 1-3 hours.  
**EBL:** 200-900mLs. Varies with surgeons  
**Cell Saver:** Sometimes, but rarely utilized  
**IV Access:** 1-2 18G  
**Phenylephrine infusion:** Possibly  
**Blood Type and Screened:** Yes  
  
**Administer Tranexamic Acid:**

-   Commonly given to limit bleeding
-   For dosing, refer to the institution’s or surgeon’s protocol for the intraoperative administration of TXA to decrease blood loss
-   A common TXA protocol is 1gram TXA or 10 – 20 mg/kg IVPB just prior to incision and repeated with incision closure

**Foley Catheter:** Yes

**A-Line:** Not required for surgical needs

**Possible complications of THA**

_Prosthetic related fracture_

-   Most occur on the femoral side during stem insertion
-   3 to 18% for uncemented components

_Nerve injury_

-   Sciatic nerve palsy
-   1-2 percent
-   The sciatic nerve is most common, especially with a posterior approach
-   The lateral femoral cutaneous, femoral, obturator, and superior gluteal nerves may also be injured
-   The peroneal division of the sciatic nerve is more susceptible to injury than the tibial division

_Postoperative leg length discrepancy_

-   Surgeons generally define a significant leg length discrepancy as 2 cm or more

_Serious Bleeding: < 0.5%_

-   Major nearby vessels that may be injured
-   Iliac and femoral vessel
-   Profunda femoris artery
-   Obturator artery
-   Superior gluteal artery
-   Note: Tranexamic acid is now commonly administered to help decrease blood loss.

_Possible causes of vascular injury_

-   Retractors
-   Osteotomes
-   Bone saw
-   Scalpel
-   Cerclage wiring
-   Excessive dissection or traction on tissues
-   Acetabular screw placement

  
_Venous thromboembolism_ (VTE): Highest risk of mortality  
_Pulmonary embolism_ \-usually from VTE  
_Fat embolism  
__Surgical site infection  
_  
**Bone Cement Implantation Syndrome (BCIS)**

-   May be fatal
-   Bone Cement Implantation Syndrome
-   Bone cement has no intrinsic adhesive properties.
-   The cement acts as “grout,” filling empty spaces and creating tight holds between the implant and irregular bone surfaces.
-   BCIS may carry up to a 16-fold increase in 30-day postoperative mortality

**Grades for Bone Cement Implantation Syndrome**

| Grade | Clinical Criterial |
| --- | --- |
| Grade 1 | Moderate hypoxia (SaO2 < 94%) or  
Hypotension (decrease in SBP > 20%) |
| Grade 2 | Severe hypoxia (SaO2 < 88%) or  
Hypotension (decrease in BP > 40%) or  
unexpected loss of consciousness |
| Grade 3 | Cardiovascular collapse requiring CPR |

**Early hemodynamic indicators of BCIS:**

-   Bradycardia
-   Hypotension

_Continuous electrocardiography (ECG) and maintenance of systolic blood pressure to within 20% of the baseline is recommended_

**If BCIS is suspected:**

-   Increase inspired oxygen to 100%| and supplemental oxygen should be continued postoperatively
-   If there is cardiovascular collapse, consider treating it as RV failure
-   In severe cases, a central venous catheter may be indicated for the administration of inotropic drugs
-   The choice of a vasopressor is facilitated by the presence of noninvasive CO monitoring or a pulmonary artery flotation catheter
-   Aggressive resuscitation with IV fluids
-   For hypotension, opinion is divided as to the relative merits of a pure alpha-adrenergic agonist or a mixed alpha and beta-receptor agonist
-   Hemodynamic instability should be treated with the potential etiology in mind
-   Sympathetic alpha 1 agonists should be the first-line agent in the context of right heart dysfunction
