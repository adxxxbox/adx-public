### Rationale for Caution in Administering Protamine

Administering Protamine may be associated with circulatory instability due to mild to moderate vasodilation and mild negative inotropic effects.  
  
It must be administered slowly over 5-15 minutes. Too-rapid administration can cause profound hypotension.  
  
**Dr. Adam Evec** (see Tips/Facts Coming off pump):  
prefers to give CaCl2 concomitantly with protamine to counter the BP drop.  
  
Some surgeons prefer to be informed when half the protamine has been administered.  
  
Be cognizant of a history of pulmonary hypertension. Severe pulmonary hypertension after protamine neutralization of heparin is an infrequent but life-threatening event following cardiopulmonary bypass. In that event, the administration of pulmonary vasodilators and resumption of cardiopulmonary bypass is standard treatment.  
  
Anaphylactoid reaction response to protamine or protamine-heparin complex is rare.
