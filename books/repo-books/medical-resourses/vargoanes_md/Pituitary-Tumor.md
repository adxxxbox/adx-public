### Pituitary Tumor - Transsphenoidal Resection

For anesthesia, this case is similar to your basic Endoscopic Sinus Surgery. However, this case is much longer in duration and it involves 2 different surgeons. An ENT surgeon starts the procedure by gaining access to the pituitary gland (up the nose through the sphenoid) and then the neurosurgeon removes the pituitary tumor. A fat graft is placed in the area where the tumor was removed. A cartilage graft is placed to close the hole in the sella. Biologic glue is applied over the area.

**Indications:** Pituitary Tumor  
**Anesthetic**: General/ETT; oral Rae  
**Duration:** 2-4 hours; depends on surgeons.  
**EBL:** 25 - 200 mLs  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
**Positioning:** Supine, HOB up 30 degrees (or reverse T-berg). The arm will be tucked at the side of the bed where the surgeon sits or stands.

**Anti-emetics:** yes; Decadron and Zofran.

**NGT:** For the surgeon to pass orally after the throat pack is out.  
**Avoid hypertension:** To minimize bleeding, but stay within 20% of the base. Consider a beta-blocker with emergence. You can titrate your inhalation agent with desired BP.

  
**Emergence:** Smooth, avoid coughing. Consider Robinul to prevent secretions from draining and agitating the vocal cords. Gently suction the oral pharynx with a flexible vinyl catheter, not a Yankauer suction device.  
At the end of the operation it is usual to have a pack (sponge dressing) in each nostril to soak up any blood. This is kept in place for a few hours. The patient is now an obligate mouth breather.  
**Extubation:** Deep or Awake?  
Most of us extubate with the patient deep. Some patients may require an awake extubation so try to make it smooth. Some insert an LMA after a deep extubation and the LMA is later taken out in PACU.  
  
**Possible Complications:**  
Diabetes Insipidus  
Bleeding  
Blindness  
Eye muscle injury  
Spinal fluid leak  
Meningitis  
  
**Diabetes insipidus after pituitary surgery**  
Vasopressin is secreted from the posterior pituitary gland, which may result in diabetes insipidus (DI).  
Polyuria is common after transsphenoidal surgery; however it is not always due to DI. In fact, the most common cause of polyuria in the postoperative setting is diuresis of intravenous fluids administered in the perioperative period. Other causes of postsurgical polyuria include hyperglycemia and diuretic administration.  
These should be considered and excluded before treatment of DI is initiated. Also, acromegalic patients have been known to have increased urinary output following resection of the pituitary microadenoma due to diuresis of excess fluid in the soft tissues.  
  
**Spinal Fluid Leak:**  

If the surgeon notices the leakage of spinal fluid at the end of the case, he/she may use a fat graft in the sella to seal the dura. He may also reconstruct the floor of the sella with bone salvaged from the exposure.

**More notes**  
There are 2 approaches for direct access to the pituitary gland, craniotomy or transphenoidal (through the nose). Transphenoidal has become more popular due to fewer complications.

Pituitary tumors cause a variety of hormone problems and can grow to large size, compressing important nerves and arteries at the base of the brain. When this occurs, surgery is needed to remove the tumor, especially when vision is at risk. Tumor removal often reverses endocrine problems and restores normal hormone balance.

Using bone-biting instruments, the front wall of the sphenoid sinus is opened. At the back wall of the sphenoid sinus is a bone overlying the pituitary gland called the sella. The thin bone of the sella is removed to expose the tough lining of the skull called the dura. The dura is opened to expose the tumor and pituitary gland.

Through a small hole in the sella, the tumor is removed by the neurosurgeon in pieces with curettes.

The hole in the sella floor is replaced with bone graft from the septum.  Synthetic graft material is sometimes used when there is no suitable piece of septum or the patient has had previous surgery. Biologic glue is applied over the graft in the sphenoid sinus. This glue allows healing and prevents leaking of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the brain into the sinus and nasal cavity.
