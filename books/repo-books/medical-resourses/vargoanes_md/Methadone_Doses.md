### Methadone Doses

_Data on perioperative IV methadone doses is poor and there is no recommended standard dose._  
  
**Possible indications relevant to anesthesia**  
To prevent postoperative pain for patients involved in methadone-maintenance programs and/or for patients with a moderate tolerance to opioids.  
To decrease narcotic need postoperatively; enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols.  
For perioperative anesthesia management, IV methadone may be administered in the perioperative period as a single dose following induction or in divided doses starting preoperatively in the holding area.  
  
**Patients on methadone  
**Patients should continue their PO methadone dose before and on the day of the surgery to avoid unnecessary fluctuations of the drug level. The abrupt discontinuation of methadone before surgery is unjustifiable.  
Patients on methadone are tolerant of narcotics and it may be difficult to fulfill their narcotic needs.  
Patients on methadone who have not missed their daily dose DO NOT need to receive methadone perioperatively.  
  
**Standard IV perioperative doses of methadone:** none  
There are no standard IV perioperative doses of methadone but some studies have been published.  
For a patient who did not take methadone on the day of surgery, the IV methadone dose can be half of the patient’s PO methadone dose.  
  
**Below are documented perioperative methadone doses in anesthesia**  
Some ERAS protocols.  
10-20 mg IV post induction.  
  
**Opioid-tolerant patient NOT on methadone (documented)  
**0.2-0.3 mg/kg IV.  
Up to 30 mg IV.  
Doses are reduced by 33% in patients “physiologically” older than 60 years.  
20 mg IV for less painful procedures that will take at least 60 minutes between administration and extubation.  
When used as the primary intraoperative opioid for patients over 25 years, a single 20 mg IV bolus is appropriate before induction.  
  
In a follow-up investigation, with a greater percentage of (presumably more painful) upper abdominal incisions, after 20 mg intraoperative methadone, patients needed a median of two 5 mg methadone doses in the recovery room (which thereafter provided postoperative analgesia for 21 hours), and an additional 5 mg dose on the ward at that time, which often provided analgesia until hospital discharge.  
  
Some providers administer the methadone dose in pre-operative holding while transporting to the operating room and report a smoother induction.  
  
**Opioid-naïve patients**  
0.3 mg/kg up to 30 mg for painful procedures longer than 3 hours has been reported.  
  
**Opioid-naïve patients:** acute post op pain management Q4 hours.  
  
**Pain management sliding scale:**  
**Little/no pain:** 0.025 mg/kg of initial dose.  
**Moderate pain:** 0.05 mg/kg of initial dose.  
**Severe pain:** initial dose.  
  
**Morphine vs methadone (PO)**  
Recent studies suggest that methadone is more potent than was originally thought, with a median morphine to methadone ratio of 7.75:1 (2.5:1 to 14.3:1).  
When converting morphine to methadone, the ratio is highly variable and is dependent upon the previous morphine dose. Most methadone-related deaths occur in the first week of therapy, as a result of accumulation, _emphasizing_ the importance of careful monitoring during the initiation of therapy.  
  
**Opioid-naive patients:** The average daily IV methadone requirement is roughly 1/3 of the corresponding IV morphine requirement.  
  
**Opioid-tolerant patient:** The average daily IV methadone requirement is as little as 10-15% of the total daily morphine dosing.  
This is relevant when converting morphine to methadone for children with advanced cancer when weaning nonventilated infants and children following prolonged opioid therapy.  
  
5 mg IV increments of opioid from precoded syringes were given for pain reported in the recovery and/or surgical units.  
  
**Methadone PCA**  
Methadone is rarely used in IV-PCA form, but it may be well suited for highly opioid-tolerant patients, such as those with cancer pain.  
Common IV-PCA dosing will have a bolus range of 0.5–2.5 mg and a lockout interval of 8–20 minutes.  
  
Suggestive safe and starting doses when rotating patients from IV opioids to IV methadone with PCA.

hold multiple doses because of its prolonged duration of action.
