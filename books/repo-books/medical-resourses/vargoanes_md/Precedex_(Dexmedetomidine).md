Neuraxial Adjuvant- Precedex (Dexmedetomidine)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Neuraxial Adjuvant - Precedex (Dexmedetomidine)

Precedex is an Alpha-2 adrenergic agonist.  
Precedex is a fairly new, highly selective, alpha-2 adrenergic agonist analgesic drug that works the same way as Clonidine. Precedex has a much higher affinity ratio of alpha-2 : alpha-1 adrenergic receptors than Clonidine by a ratio of 8:1. This superior ratio over Clonidine is why studies show that Precedex is better than Clonidine as a neuraxial and regional adjuvant in the field of anesthesia.  
  
The IV use of Precedex is already popular in the ICU and anesthesia settings. It is still rarely used in regional and neuraxial anesthesia.  
  
**Alpha-2 agonist and Regional Anesthesia  
**Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists have both analgesic and sedative properties when in regional anesthesia. Most of the time they are used as an adjuvant to a local anesthetic.  
  
**Precedex and neuraxial anesthesia is still very rare  
**For the use of Precedex as an adjuvant to neuraxial anesthesia, there are some published articles that inform us of its superiority over Clonidine and other opioids, and also offer the doses administered that resulted with no adverse complications.  
  
_Many anesthesia providers still do not use Precedex as an adjuvant to neuraxial anesthesia due to the lack of studies and FDA approval.  
_Precedex was approved by the FDA in 1999 for short-term medication (<24 hours) for analgesia and sedation in the ICU.**Below are published Precedex doses used in neuraxial studies  
Intrathecal Precedex Doses  
**2-3 mcg is common  
Egypt and Europe has published studies supporting administration of 3-10mcg  
One study concluded that 3 mcg of Precedex added to 6mg of Bupivacaine produced fast onset and a prolonged duration of sensory block and postoperative analgesia in elderly patients for transurethral surgery. However, recovery of motor block could be delayed in dexmedetomidine-added patients.  
  
**Intrathecal Precedex Results from the above doses  
**Precedex is associated with prolonged motor and sensory block  
Hemodynamic stability  
Reduced demand of rescue analgesics in 24 hours as compared to clonidine, fentanyl, or bupivacaine alone.  
  
It was also stated that Dexmedetomidine added to hyperbaric bupivacaine intrathecally has a dose dependent favorable effect on the onset and regression of sensory and motor block.  
  
**Epidural Precedex Doses** 1.0-1.5mcg/kg added to the local anesthetic  
8 mcg as a bolus dose mixed with whatever local anesthetic is used  
17 ml of 0.75% Ropivacaine and 1.5 mcg/kg of dexmedetomidine  
After epidural test dose; 8 mcg of Precedex,100 mcg fentanyl, and 4 ml of 2% lidocaine then start the drip using 0.2 % ropivacaine.  
  
**Precedex is proven superior to Clonidine as an Epidural Adjuvant  
**Better for patient comfort  
More stable cardio-respiratory parametersSuperior sedative and anxiolytic propertiesEarlier onset and establishment of sensory and motor block  
Bajwa et al., compared dexmedetomidine 1.5 μg/kg versus clonidine 2 μg/kg as an additive to epidural ropivacaine in patients scheduled for vaginal hysterectomy. They observed that dexmedetomidine is a better adjuvant than clonidine in terms of intraoperative and postoperative analgesia, patient satisfaction, and cardio-respiratory effects.  
  
**CSE** Both 0.5 and 1.0 mcg/kg of dexmedetomidine administered per epidural as isolated boluses in the absence of maintenance infusions prolonged the duration of sensory and motor block of spinal anesthesia. In dexmedetomidine groups, the sedation scores were significantly increased than in the control group.  
  
**Sedation with Neuraxial Precedex** One study showed that Precedex caused a profound sedation in 36% of the patients, who were arousable by gentle tactile stimulation compared to achievement of similar sedation level in just 16% of the patients in clonidine group. No respiratory depression was observed.Not sure if we would want this in OB when it comes time to push at the end of labor.  
  
**Precedex can prevent of shivering  
**One study showed that Precedex helps prevent shivering.Only one patient out of total 25 suffered an episode of shivering.  
The alpha-2 receptor agonists are known to prevent shivering to a moderate extent without any associated respiratory depression as with other antishivering drugs such as meperidine. Dexmedetomidine reduces shivering by lowering vasoconstriction and shivering thresholds  
  
**Precedex as an Adjuvant to Peripheral Nerve Blocks**  
Dexmedetomidine exhibits synergism with local anesthetics, prolonging their duration of action. So far, the clinical evidence for the use of dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to local anesthetic for peripheral nerve blocks is limited to a few human studies.  
  
**Method of Action (MOA) per Intravenous Administration  
**Precedex is a specific and selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist. By binding to the presynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors, it inhibits the release of norepinephrine, therefore, terminating the propagation of pain signals. Activation of the postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors inhibits the sympathetic activity, which decreases blood pressure and heart rate.  
  
The sedative and anxiolytic effects of dexmedetomidine result primarily from its activity in the locus ceruleus of the brain stem. After stimulation of the receptors, there is a reductionof central sympathetic output, resulting in increased firing of inhibitory neurons.  
The presence of dexmedetomidine at alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord modulates release of substance P and produces its analgesic effects.  
  
**Four proposed MOA per Peripheral Nerve Blocks**  
Direct action on the peripheral nerve  
Centrally mediated analgesia  
Alpha-2B-alpha adrenoceptors mediated vasoconstrictive effects  
Attenuation of the inflammatory response  
  
**Crossing the Placenta** After crossing the human placenta, Precedex disappeared faster than clonidine from the maternal circulation, while even less Precedex was transported into the fetal circulation.  
  
**Metabolism of Precedex  
**Dexmedetomidine undergoes almost complete hydroxylation through direct glucuronidation and cytochrome P450 metabolism in liver. Metabolites are excreted in the urine (about 95%) and feces (4%).  
The elimination half-life is approximately two hours. The average protein binding is 94%.
