### Aortocaval Compression

The compression of the vena cava and aorta in the supine position from the gravid uterus.  
  
**After 20 weeks gestation, supine position should be avoided and the uterus should be displaced 15-30 degrees to the left. This can be accomplished by:**  
A wedge under right hip.  
1 liter IV bag under right hip.  
Tilt operating table to the left.  
Some aortocaval compression starts at 13-15 weeks gestation (literature varies)  
Can ↓ CO by 10-20% at full term  
Can ↓ SV by 10-20% at full term Decrease venous return via gravid uterus compressing the inferior vena cava  
Lower extremity blood flow ¯ 50%  
↑ uterine venous pressure  
Uterine blood flow may decrease 20% -may also not be affected  
May cause fetal distress  
Blood flow to upper extremities is usually normal  
May ↑ brachial artery BP from an ↑ in SVR from aortic compression  
  
**Supine Hypotension Syndrome**  
(another issue in supine position)  
Bradycardia and Hypotension in the supine position may occur up to 15% of pregnant women.  
It may not occur until several minutes after being placed in the supine position and may then cause tachycardia. There is a profound drop in venous return and the cardiovascular system is unable to compensate.  
  
**Aortocaval Compression Syndrome  
**Compression of the inferior vena cava occurs as early as 13-15 weeks gestation.  
This has been proven by the observed 50% increase in femoral venous pressure observed in the supine position.  
By full term, femoral venous pressure is increased by 2.5 times in the supine position versus a nonpregnant woman.  
  
**Left Lateral Decubitus Position  
**At term, the left lateral decubitus position reduces the enhancement of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system activity and less suppression of cardiac vagal activity.  
Right lateral decubitus does not.  
At 20 weeks (literature varies) the enlarged uterus approaches the level of the umbilicus, the uterus can cause compression of both the inferior vena cava and the descending aorta in the supine position. The combination of these leads to a reduced venous return and decreased CO.  
By 38–40 weeks gestational age, there is a 25–30% decrease in CO when turning from the lateral to the supine position. Unfortunately, the uterus cannot adjust or autoregulate blood flow when it is compromised. The decreased uterine blood flow reduces placental perfusion and can lead to maternal hypotension and a subsequent fetal acidemia. In supine position at full term, there can be complete obstruction of the inferior vena cava.  
  
**Blood can return from the lower extremities via collateral circulation:**  
Intraosseous veins  
Vertebral veins  
Paravertebral veins  
Epidural veins  
The collateral circulation is still less than the normal blood return to the heart resulting in a decrease right atrial pressure (RAP).  
  
**Aortocaval Compression and Regional Anesthesia**  
A left lateral decubitus position is especially important with regional anesthesia. During regional anesthesia, the effects of aortocaval compression will be exaggerated due to a lack of compensatory reflexes subsequent to the sympathetic blockade. This can lead to profound hypotension.  
In cases of extreme hypotension (or fetal compromise such as a bradycardia) the patient can be turned to the full left lateral position.
