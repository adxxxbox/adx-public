### ACDF: Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion

  
Please review Anterior Cervical Discectomy for details. The surgeon enters the front of the neck and performs a complete discectomy (removal of the disc, including the protruding bone fragments). After this, there is no longer a disc compressing a nerve that is causing pain.  
There is now an empty space between the two bony vertebral bodies. To prevent the vertebrae from collapsing and rubbing together, the surgeon fills the open disc space with a bone graft, which looks like a spacer. You know the graft is being inserted when you see the surgeon gently tapping it into the disc space between the two vertebral bodies.  
Then for the fusion, a small titanium metal plate is attached to the vertebrae with small screws to secure immediate stability. This permits optimal bone healing and fusion. Once this is complete, the surgeon will take the last set of C-arm pictures and begin to close the incision. That’s when it is time for you to begin to breathe the patient back.

**Pre-op:**  
Assess the patient’s cervical ROM. If the ROM is limited due to pain, be prepared to use a glide scope. Have your airway plan set for all the possibilities: Glidescope, flexible Gum bougie, Macintosh and Miller blades, suction on and ready.  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT. (See reminders below) Elective Glide Scope intubations are common in a cervical neutral position for unstable necks.  
**NIMs ETT:** Rarely, only at surgeon’s request.  
Possibly an Elective Glide Scope Intubation.  
**_Document that you intubated with the head in neutral position._**  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**Blood Loss:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable. Remember, arms will be tucked, and make sure the IV runs well as soon as you and the circulating RN finish tucking the arms.  
**Neosynephrine Drip:** Yes, connect before the arms are tucked.  
**LTA kit:** Consider it when you are not using a paralytic, but it is difficult to spray the glottis if you are using a glide scope.  
**Antibiotics:** Usually Ancef, unless contraindicated.  
**Positioning:** Supine with arms tucked.  
**BIS Monitor:** Sometimes, especially if the patient is being monitored with ½ MAC of inhalational gas.  
**Ketamine:** Is a good choice when not permitted to relax the patient. 0.5mg/kg just prior to incision.  
**Possible Complications:**  
Hemorrhage or formation of a wound hematoma.  
Damage to the carotid or vertebral artery, resulting in a stroke or excessive bleeding, even death.  
Damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve resulting in hoarseness.  
Damage to the superior laryngeal nerve resulting in dysphagia.  
Damage to the esophagus or trachea resulting in infection.  
Damage to the dura, resulting in a cerebrospinal fluid leak or pocket of cerebral spinal fluid beneath the incision (pseudomeningocele).  
Mechanical complications of the graft and plate (including graft migration, breakage of the plate, screw pullout, etc.).  
Wound infection.  
Development of painful pseudoarthrosis (failure of adequate fusion to occur).  
Damage to the spinal cord or nerve root(s) -Neurological Myelopathy.  
 

**Reminders:**  
Make sure the IV and the Neosynephrine drip still flow with the IV arm tucked. You may want to tape the pulse oximetry sensor to a finger, if your institution uses the clothespin model of pulse oximetry.  
Find out what side of the neck the surgeon is entering. Most surgeons enter the right side of the patient’s neck. Sometimes you will be requested to tape the ETT tube to the opposite side.   
  
Consider using one of those small flexible tube extenders while removing the anesthesia circuit’s elbow piece. That little flex tube can be manipulated like an accordion. This permits you to position the ETT and circuit just above the patient’s face towards you and out of the surgeon’s way. Also, position your Xmas tree or anesthesia tubing circuit holder behind the patient’s head so it is also out of the surgeon’s way.

**Find out if the surgeon wants the patient relaxed?**  
If the surgeon wants NO relaxation, then you need to consider running 1.5 MAC or higher concentration of gas because you definitely don’t want the patient moving in response to pain. You will most likely need a Neosynephrine drip because the higher the MAC, the more vascular dilation. Also, you may consider a small bolus of Propofol as well as 0.5mg/kg of Ketamine just prior to incision.  Give Ofirmev or Toradol early; most surgeons prefer Ofirmev. But please do a thorough history of the patient’s medications before you put the patient to sleep and start giving Ofirmev. Many of these patients have been in pain for weeks to months prior to surgery; and most neuro surgeons give lots of analgesics leading up to surgery. If the patient has been on a Tylenol-based narcotic like Norco, et. al., ask the patient exactly how much he or she has been taking and do the Tylenol maximum dose calculations!! I have heard of a case of liver failure in a hospital where a gram dose of Ofirmev given during surgery and lots of Norco given by unassuming floor nursing staff after a particularly painful procedure led to a horrible outcome. Most authorities say not to give over 4 grams of acetaminophen daily to patients with a healthy liver. So see if the patient has had Liver Function Studies as well.  
Decadron is a great drug for these cases also.  
 

**Neuro Monitoring (Neurophysiologic Intraoperative Monitoring)**  
It is rare to monitor for an ACDF unless the stenosis is so severe the surgeon may feel it’s necessary. If there is monitoring, you have to change your game plan.

**With Neuro Monitoring**: You will most likely be using ½ MAC of Gas with a Propofol infusion. You want to find this out from the monitor tech as early as possible so you aren’t scrambling for a Propofol pump and tubing prior to the start of the case. Many of us use a BIS monitor when monitoring to titrate the Propofol drip. 

**_Note: If you have one IV and will be running a Neosynephrine and Propofol drip, consider inserting a stopcock or a “Crows Feet” drip connector inline. This creates more ports closer to the patient. However, it is much easier to have a second IV._**

**If the surgeon is not using Neuro Monitoring:**  
Use the same anesthetic plan as the Anterior Cervical Discectomy listed above.   

**Induction with Neuro Monitoring:**  
Anectine is popular, or you may elect to go with a small dose of a nondepolarizer.  
Don’t forget to connect your Propofol and Neosynephrine tubing to the IV tubing before the arms are tucked and secured. Make sure your IV tubing does not get kinked.

Start your Propofol at around 100mcgs/kg/min and turn your gas down to ½ MAC. 

The monitor tech should inform you when the patient’s twitches have returned. If you gave too much of a nondepolarizer for induction and you are sitting there with no return of twitches, you may have to reverse the patient while under the general anesthetic.

After the bone graft is in place, the C-arm will be utilized for one last time to confirm everything is in place. The surgeon will then start to close the incision.

This is when you inform the neuro monitor tech that he/she should run the last checks because you are turning off your Propofol infusion and are turning up the gas. Don’t forget that Ofirmev is preferred over Toradol for neck procedures by most surgeons.

Hope for a smooth non-coughing emergence. Try Lidocaine .25 mg/kg IV to block coughing.  
**Extubation:** Many of us are taught to perform awake extubations on neck procedures. Deep extubations are becoming more popular for patients who have been assessed with easy airways preoperatively. Use good discretion and use an oral or nasal airway.
