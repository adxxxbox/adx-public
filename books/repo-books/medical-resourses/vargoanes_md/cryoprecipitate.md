# Cryoprecipitate

It is a concentrated blood component made FFP.  
It is really only used as a fibrinogen supplement.  
Better treatments are available for von Willebrand disease, Hemophilia A and factor XIII deficiency.  
  
**Doses**  
**Standard adult dose:** Pool of 10 -20 units.  
**Peds:** 1 unit per 10kg child.  
Blood bank needs 1 hour to prepare.  
  
**It is basically concentrated with:**  
Fibrinogen  
Factor VIII (needed for Hemophilia A)  
Factor XIII  
vWF (Von Willebrand factor)  
Fibronectin  
Usually a cloudy yellow color.  
Cryoprecipitate is available in pre-pooled concentrates of six units.  
I have found many discrepancies of how much fibrinogen is in Cryo bags.  
6 bags (1pool) can contains 2,000mg Fibrinogen.  
Recovery with transfusion = 75%.  
Cryo Adult Dose is 10 bags.  
1 bag contains ~350 mg Fibrinogen.  
  
10 units will increase plasma fibrinogen about 1gram/L.  
**In a 70 kg Patient:** 6 bags (1pool) of cryo raises Fibrinogen 45 mg/dL.  
1 unit per 10kg child,which should increase fibrinogen by 60 - 100 mg/dL.  
**Indicated for Bleeding Associated with:**  
Hemophilia A  
Von Willebrand's disease  
DIC  
Uremic bleeding  
Fibrinogen deficiancy  
  
**Disadvantage of Cryo**  
Although blood donors are screened for hepatitis and HIV, cryo is not treated to destroy viruses. This is one of the reasons cryo is not a preferred treatment for bleeding disorders in the U.S.  
Another disadvantage of cryo is that it must be kept frozen until it is used. Then it must be defrosted.  
Just like FFP, can be stored frozen for up to 12 months.
