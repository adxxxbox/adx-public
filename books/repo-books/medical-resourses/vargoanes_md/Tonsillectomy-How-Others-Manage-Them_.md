### Tonsillectomy - How Others Manage Them

Inhalation induction and start IV.

**Basic Tonsillectomy:**

Inhalation induction and start IV.

Fentanyl 1 mcg/kg up front and sometimes a bump of propofol, depending on the need for it before intubation.

Use an Oral Rae cuffed tube.

70/30 N20/02 with Sevoflurane throughout the procedure.

4:2:1 rule for fluid requirement. Attempt to infuse the first hour of the fluid requirement for prevention of PONV/post-tonsillectomy bleed.

Get the patient back breathing ASAP and use the PSV Pro ventilator mode to maintain adequate tidal volumes so as not to cause atelectasis.

Titrate morphine after gaining spontaneous ventilation for a total dose of 0.1 mg/kg.

I give Zofran and Decadron up front as well.

**For T&A**  
When the surgeon places red rubber catheters, turn off the Sevoflurane and keep your total flows of N20/02 low, at a total of 2 L.

The Goal is for the end-tidal concentration of Sevoflurane to be 0.7 when procedure has finished.

Turn your gas flows up when they pause to reopen the oral retractor at the end to recheck for bleeding. Some of the retractors can tamponade bleeding in the oropharynx, therefore they let it down briefly to ensure hemostasis.

When awake, give remainder of Morphine up to a total of .1 mg/kg.

Note: For severe OSA who have a diagnosis per sleep study: AHI > 10, we usually skip any long lasting narcotics.

Extubate awake with reflexes intact. Transfer patient in the lateral recovery position to the PACU.

  
**Second note:**  
Ketamine 0.3-0.5 mg/kg given at extubation works excellent for PACU pain/recovery. This is controversial.

**_How Beth Branson Selbee, CRNA manages her tonsillectomies._**  
I manage them the exact same way as Mary McDonough Smith, CRNA does above, except for:  
I don't use N2O after induction.  
I do not give long acting IV narcotics, just fentanyl.  
I don’t use ketamine.

**_How Brian Delgrosso, CRNA manages his tonsillectomies._**  
**Tonsillectomies (basic) and T&As:**  
**Preoperative:**  
Most patients come without an PIV, so they get 0.5mg/kg of PO Midazolam 15minutes prior to going back to OR.

**Induction:**

Standard ASA monitors  
Inhalation induction with 30/70% with O2/N20 adding in Sevoflurane up to 8%.  
**After a peripheral IV access is obtained, I administer:**  
1mcg/kg of Fentanyl  
0.5mg/kg Decadron  
0.1mg/kg Zofran  
0.5mcg/kg of Dexmedetomidine  
  
ETT is placed and taped midline.  
Most CRNAs prefer using regular ETT tubes, sometimes I will use an oral rae.  
  
The bed is turned 180 degrees away.

**Maintenance:**  
Patients are initially kept on a room air concentration with Sevoflurane. If patient needs additional medication based on vitals, most of us will titrate in additional 1mcg/kg of Fentanyl.  
  
When the first tonsil is removed, start to get patient back breathing. Once the surgeon is done using the cautery, increase the O2 to 100% and turn the Sevoflurane off.  
Then manually begin titrating in 0.5mcg/kg of Dexmedetomidine.

**Emergence:**  
The patient will be suctioned by the ENT Doctor.  
The bed is then turned back to you.  
Insert a soft bite block in and utilize a soft tip suction if needed.  
Once the patient is spontaneously breathing and the gas is fully off, extubate your patient and patient and use blow by oxygen.  
Additional, Dexmedetomidine (0.5mcg/kg) can be worked in slowly if your patient is still agitated; however, most will remain relatively calm.

**Post-Operative:**  
The nurses are instructed to start titrating in 0.5mg/kg of Morphine as the patient starts to wake up from the Dexmedetomidine, in order to prevent agitation/pain.

(NOTE) At our facility, a lot of anesthesia providers, based on literature reviews, have found Dexmedetomidine helped with wake up agitation and pain if morphine was given prior to patients waking up from the Dexmedetomidine boluses. We use the initial dose of 0.5mcg/kg of Dexmedetomidine for induction and titrate in additional doses per patient requirements.
