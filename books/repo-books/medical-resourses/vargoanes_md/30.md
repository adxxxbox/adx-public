### Discontinuing Cardiopulmonary Bypass

Referring to information provided by the PA catheter pressures (with or without trans-esophageal echocardiography) the post-bypass requirements of the heart are determined.  
  
Possible states and indicated remedial measures:

-   **Volume deficit:** CVP and MAP, if indicated use albumin, hetastarch or similar colloid, cell saver blood, PRBCs or crystalloid.
-   **Decreased systemic vascular resistance:** Calculate SVR in Wood units =

**(Systemic Vascular Resistance = 80x(Mean Arterial Pressure - Mean Venous Pressure or CVP) / Cardiac Output)**  
  
If it is decreased, consider neosynephrine, norepinephrine or vasopressin. SVR should be in the range 1,000-1,2000 Wood units.

-   **Low cardiac index or cardiac output:** Administer inotropes; dobutamine, milrinone or epinephrine.
-   **Increased systemic vascular resistance:** Administer nitroglycerine.

Always administer CaCl2 unless calcium levels are high.  
  
The surgeon and anesthesia team can give orders for a rapid and accurate correction ensuring successful weaning from bypass.
