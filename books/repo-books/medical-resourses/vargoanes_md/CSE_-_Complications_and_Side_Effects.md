### CSE - Complications and Side Effects

  
CSE:(Combined Spinal Epidural)  
**_By Lisa Moreno, CRNA_**  
_Also see “Neuraxial Complications” section_

**Failed or inadequate spinal block or failed epidural** Because a CSE has multiple steps, it is possible to have a portion of the block fail.Occasionally, if you took too long inserting and securing the epidural catheter, then the spinal may not have risen high enough.  
  
Also, the epidural may be inadequate and you will not find out until it is too late to fix it.  
  
**Test dosing of epidural catheter is not clear  
**As stated above, the test dosing of the epidural catheter is not always 100% clear.  
  
**High Spinal  
**As with all spinals and epidurals, there is a potential for a high block, particularly when you are re-dosing the epidural catheter.  
**Example:** With a regular epidural (not CSE) we normally administer 5ml of Lidocaine 2%. This would give a predictable slight raise in the epidural block.  
However, with that same epidural dose with a CSE, you may get more of an elevation in the level than you intended.  
  
**Remember:** A CSE involves intentional dural puncture followed by epidural drug administration. This introduces the possibility of epidural local anesthetic migrating from the epidural space to the subarachnoid space. This can give you a higher block.
