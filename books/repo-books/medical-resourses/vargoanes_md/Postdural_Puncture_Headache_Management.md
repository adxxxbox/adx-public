Postdural Puncture Headache (PDPH) Management    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Postdural Puncture Headache (PDPH) Management

**Management goals for PDPH:**  
Promote the physiologic replacement of lost CSF.  
Seal the puncture site.  
Control cerebral vasodilatation.  
  
\- Not all patients will require hospital admission because PDPH is usually a self-limiting process.  
\- If left untreated, 75% resolve within the first week, and 88% resolve by six weeks. Bedrest, hydration, and caffeine have been traditionally recommended to prevent PDPH when a wet tap occurs; however, no conclusive evidence supports their use.  
  
Most anesthesia providers utilize a conservative multimodal approach for the first 24-48 hours.  
  
The treatment ladder of PDPH includes conservative management, medications, nerve block, and, if necessary, an Epidural Blood Patch (EBP).  
  
**Conservative management** is a form of supportive therapy used in the first 24-48 hours of a PDPH and is usually not very helpful in moderate to severe cases.  
  
An EBP should always be part of the management algorithm since severe and potentially fatal complications are derived from delayed and inadequate management of this condition.  
  
\- In the last few decades, more conservative and regional techniques have been described that could be applicable in non-severe PDPH.  
\- Some are relatively novel and require more research.  
  
**Conservative treatments and medications:** First 24-48 hours**  
Many anesthesia providers use a multimodal approach and combine some of the following conservative treatments below:  
**Bedrest-supine  
Hydration 1-liter bolus and euvolemic  
NSAIDs  
Oral opioids (oxycodone)  
Caffeine  
Fioricet -becoming popular (tablets)  
Cosyntropin - becoming popular  
Abdominal binder  
  
**Other documented conservative treatments that may modestly decrease the severity of PDPH but need more research:  
**Steroids (hydrocortisone)  
Neostigmine and atropine  
Pregabalin or Gabapentin  
Theophylline  
Antiemetics (5HT-3 antagonists)  
Sumatriptan  
  
**Stool softeners and a soft diet** will help decrease Valsalva straining and leakage of CSF.  
  
**Invasive treatments for PDPH:** (when conservative treatment fails)  
Epidural blood patch (EPB)  
Transnasal sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGB)  
Greater occipital nerve block**  
  
Conservative management:  
Supine or prone position:  
**\- A supine position reduces the intensity of the headache.\- Lying in the prone position increases intra-abdominal pressure, which in turn increases the CSF pressure, but this position is not practical for many patients in the postoperative period.  
\- However, there is no evidence that bed rest will reduce the duration of headaches.  
\- Early ambulation should be encouraged, if tolerated, to reduce complications.  
\- Bed rest should be encouraged for patients not tolerating an upright position.  
\- However, bed rest may increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, particularly during the puerperium period.  
  
**Hydration:  
**\- Theoretically, hydration encourages the production of CSF.  
\- Dehydration may contribute to the severity of symptoms that the patient experiences.  
\- Patients should be hydrated intravenously and encouraged to take fluids by mouth.  
\- Studies, however, do not show a decrease in the duration of PDPH.  
\- However, no patient with PDPH should be allowed to become dehydrated.  
  
**NSAIDs:**  
Analgesic medication administration may decrease the severity of the signs and symptoms. Medications include acetaminophen or NSAIDs such as ibuprofen.   
  
**Caffeine:**  
\- Theoretically, caffeine helps decrease signs and symptoms of a headache by vasoconstriction of the cerebral vessels.  
\- In practice, oral caffeine intake is encouraged.  
\- However, only a few clinical controlled trials have assessed its effectiveness, showing benefit only during the first few hours.  
\- Caffeine may help decrease the intensity of PDPH, but caffeine has not reduced the number of patients that require an EBP.  
  
**Caffeine oral or IV dose:** 300 to 500 mg/day, with a maximum of 900 mg in 24 hours.  
\- IV 500 mg in a 1000cc bag of NS infused over 1 hour.  
\- A second dose may be administered in 5 hours.  
**  
Possible adverse effects from high doses of caffeine:**  
Insomnia  
Anxiety  
Seizures  
May cross into the maternal milk.  
**Fioricet** (a combination of acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine): PO  
**Fioricet contains:**  
325 mg of acetaminophen  
40 mg of caffeine  
50 mg of Butalbital  
**Dose:** One or two tablets every 4 hours as needed.  
The total daily dosage should be at most six tablets.  
  
**Cosyntropin** (Cortrosyn): An ACTH analog  
500mcg in 1-liter of normal saline  
**Cosyntropin simplified mechanism of action concerning PDPH:  
\-** Increased aldosterone secretion (fluid and electrolyte retention)  
**\-** Promotion of dural edema→ Overlap of the puncture site**\-** Increases CSF production through active Na+ transport**\-** Causes a release of brain B-endorphins  
\- Anti-inflammatory action  
\- ACTH is still under investigation, and despite its growing popularity, there is still not sufficient evidence to support its inclusion in routine PDPH management  
  
**Steroids:**  
\- Steroids (hydrocortisone)  
\- Hydrocortisone has shown better results than most other conservative treatments in clinical controlled trials.  
**  
Mechanism of action:**  
\- Unknown, but the effects are believed to be attributed to the action on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which includes increased production of CSF due to the active transport of sodium and the blood's expansion volume and the release of aldosterone and increased production of endorphins in the brain.  
**Clinical trials recommend doses:** 100 mg every 8 hours for 48 hours.  
  
**Antiemetics: 5HT-3 antagonists**\- There is some documentation that ondansetron (0.15 mg/kg) may reduce the incidence of PDPH and hypotension, and PONV in parturients undergoing spinal anesthesia for cesarean section.  
\- However, more clinical trials are needed.  
\- Antiemetics are usually employed with PDPH protocols for nausea alone.  
  
**Methylxanthines (Theophylline):**  
\- Methylxanthines act on adenosine receptors and lead to vasoconstriction, which counters compensatory cerebral vasodilation.  
\- They also activate sodium-potassium pumps that are involved in the regulation of CSF production.  
  
**Pregabalin or Gabapentin:  
Mechanism of action for decreasing PDPH:** Unclear  
\- It is believed to modulate the presynaptic NMD receptors at the spinal cord level or inhibit the sympathetic pathway of pain.  
\- Both medications are effective in reducing the severity of pain associated with PDPH in their studies  
\- Pregabalin was found to be the more effective of the two medications because pregabalin has a higher affinity for alpha-2-delta receptors and analgesic efficacy.  
\- There still needs to be more literature.  
**  
Abdominal binder:  
**\- A tight abdominal binder raises intra-abdominal pressure.  
\- The elevated intra-abdominal pressure is transmitted to the epidural space and may partially relieve the headache.  
\- Unfortunately, tight binders are uncomfortable and are seldom used in current practice.  
  
**Sumatriptan:**  
\- Sumatriptan is a 5-HT1D receptor agonist that promotes cerebral vasoconstriction like caffeine.  
\- It is commonly used in treating migraines and showed promise in early case series studies on PDPH.  
\- However, _**randomized controlled trials**_ examining its efficacy have yielded negative results.  
**  
Nerve blocks used for PDPH:  
Transnasal sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGB)  
**\- They are rarely used for PDPH by anesthesia providers.  
\- However, emergency medicine literature suggests that it should be the first-line treatment of headaches after a dural puncture because it is less invasive with reasonable success.  
\- ISPGBs are widely used in the treatment of migraine headaches, cluster headaches, trigeminal neuralgia, and orofacial pain.  
\- In 1 case series of 32 patients, 69% of the women did not require an EBP.  
  
**Greater occipital nerve block:  
**\- It has been published, showing benefits in the management of PDPH.\- They are rarely used for PDPH by anesthesia providers.\- It interrupts pain transmission to the trigeminal and greater occipital nerves, activated by dural stretch in PDPH.  
\- It has been frequently used to manage some specific chronic headaches.  
\- It has shown a 66% efficacy rate and occasionally requires multiple injections to achieve and sustain analgesia.  
**  
Epidural blood patch (EPB):**  
\- Considered the gold standard therapy for moderate to severe PDPH.  
\- It is believed to work in two different ways.  
\- First, the blood is thought to replace the volume of CSF lost  
\- Autologous blood is presumed to seal the dural aperture from where the CSF leaks leading to intracranial hypotension, causing PDPH.  
\- A routine prophylactic epidural blood patch is not recommended because there are too few trial participants to allow reliable conclusions.  
\- Refer to “Epidural Blood Patch” for details.  
**Prophylactic epidural saline or colloid solution:  
**\- It is believed that injecting saline into the epidural space may increase epidural pressure, decrease CSF loss, induce an inflammatory reaction, and promote closure of the dural perforation.  
\- No studies can demonstrate either a sustained rise in CSF pressure or accelerated closure of the dural perforation after the administration of epidural saline.
