### CSE for Cesarean Section - Sitting Up Too Long

  
CSE:(Combined Spinal Epidural)  

The hyperbaric bupivacaine used for spinal anesthesia works well in the CSE technique. The patient sits up a little longer (while you are threading and securing the epidural catheter) after the spinal injection as compared to the single shot spinal technique.  
If you are experienced and efficient, the block will usually NOT settle lower during the time it takes to pass and secure the epidural catheter.  
  
**If the block settles too low  
**However, if you are not efficient and take too long to thread and secure the epidural, the block will settle too low and be inadequate for a C-section. Once that low spinal block sets up, you cannot change the level with patient positioning.  
  
So now you had better hope you inserted and threaded the epidural catheter correctly. If the block settles too low, you just need to dose the epidural catheter – it’s that simple.  
You can administer 5-10 mL of saline and that will move the move the spinal block more cephalad.  
  
For a CSE spinal, we normally administer the same dose as an single shot spinal.  
However, if a smaller spinal dose is clinically indicated, (5 to 7.5 mg with narcotics), then augmentation of the block may be required with 2% lidocaine with epinephrine via the epidural to raise the block to T4.  
  
**Anecdote:** I use CSEA mostly for labor analgesia. Early in the learning curve, we had disappointing results from the intrathecal meds while we were threading and securing the catheter. That problem went away when we began using plain 0.75% MPF bupivacaine – you know, the kind marked “not for obstetric uses” – for our intrathecal bolus. That is pretty nearly isobaric, works almost immediately, and stays put while you thread your epidural.  
As an incidental finding, we see much less fetal bradycardia with this than with the old hyperbaric injection especially when used simply for intrathecal injection without an epidural.  
I have no explanation for that.  
My CSEA for labor analgesia is a two-puncture deal. I inject the intrathecal fairly low, the patient gets comfort within a contraction or two, the FHR remains stable, and I proceed with epidural insertion. Works for me. For C-section, we just do a single-injection spinal. Our C-section docs are experienced and pretty fast.  
  
An Army buddy. R.K. Baumgarten wrote a letter to the editor about this labeling and why it is unwarranted but will probably never change. He is an MDA and has a pharmacology doctorate as well. I think it was in A&A. I do teach that, but I would not necessarily publish it, in light of the labeling mentioned.
