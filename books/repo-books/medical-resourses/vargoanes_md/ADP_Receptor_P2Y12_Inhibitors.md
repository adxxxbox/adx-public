### ADP Receptor P2Y12 Inhibitors

**ADP Receptor/P2Y12 Inhibitors  
  
**When the P2Y 12 platelet receptor interacts with ADP, it inhibits the GPIIb/IIIa receptors on the surface of the platelets from binding with fibrinogen for platelet aggregation.  
**Remember:** Fibrinogen links all the platelets together for platelet aggregation.  
  
**ADP Receptor/P2Y12 Inhibitors**Clopidogrel (Plavix, Duoplavin)  
Prasugrel (Effient, Efient)  
Ticagrelor (Brilligue)  
Ticlopidin (Ticlid)  
  
Clopidogrel and prasugrel are prodrugs, meaning it is their metabolites that do the work.
