# Remifentanil (Ultiva) Pharmacology and Notes

**Pharmacology  
**A synthetic sterile, nonpyrogenic, preservative-free, white to off-white lyophilized powder for (IV) administration after reconstitution and dilution.  
An opioid agonist mostly known for with rapid onset and peak effect and ultra-short duration of action-due to being less soluble than the other opioids

* * *

**Pharmacokinetics:  
**After IV doses given over 60 seconds, it uses a three-compartment model =  
rapid distribution half-life of 1 minute  
slower distribution half-life of 6 minutes  
terminal elimination half-life of 10 to 20 minutes.  
The effective biological half-life is 3 to 10 minutes-even after a 4-12 hour drip has a rapid blood-brain equilibration half-time of 1 (+-) 1 minutes  
The pharmacokinetics are unaffected by the presence of renal or hepatic impairment.  
Contains 15 mg glycine; and hydrochloric acid to buffer the solutions to a nominal pH of 3 after reconstitution.  
The pH ranges from 2.5 to 3.5.  
pKa of 7.07.  
Partition coefficient of 17.9 at pH 7.3

* * *

  
**During General Anesthesia  
**Not recommended as the sole agent because of a high incidence of apnea, muscle rigidity, and tachycardia.  
Very synergistic with other anesthetics so may need to reduce doses of propofol, isoflurane, and midazolam by up to 75%  
Must be titrated to effect.

* * *

  
**Most Common Adverse Events (**in just 1% at the recommended doses)**  
Respiratory depression**\- Rates greater than 0.2 mcg/kg/min are generally associated with respiratory depression (respiratory rates less than 8 breaths/min).

* * *

  
**Skeletal Muscle Rigidity** - related to the dose and speed of administration.  
**Chest Wall Rigidity** (inability to ventilate) after single doses of > 1 mcg/kg administered over 30 to 60 seconds, or after infusion rates > 0.1 mcg/kg/min. Single doses < 1 mcg/kg may cause chest wall rigidity while already on a drip

* * *

**Treatment of Muscle rigidity with induction**  
Stopping or decreasing the rate of administration  
The administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent and the concurrent induction medications. Rigidity after halting infusion usually resolves within minutes. If it appears life-threatening- quick dose of neuromuscular blocker or Narcan  
  

* * *

**Indications**  
For use during the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia.

* * *

**Mechanism of Action  
**Remifentanil is a u-opioid agonist with rapid onset and peak effect, and short duration of action.  
  

* * *

**Distribution**

Initial Vd is approximately 100 mL/kg and distributes into peripheral tissue with a Vd at steady state of approximately 350 mL/kg. Plasma protein binding is approximately 70%  
  

* * *

**Metabolism  
**Other synthetic opioids are hepatically metabolised, remifentanil undergoes rapid hydrolysis by non-specific tissue and plasma esterases.

So do not administer it with the same IV tubing with blood due to potential inactivation by nonspecific esterases in blood products.

* * *

**Histamine Release:** no elevation in plasma histamine levels have been seen documented after doses up to 30 mcg/kg over 60 seconds.

* * *

**Gender:**No differences have been shown in the pharmacodynamic activity

* * *

**Elimination  
**Elimination t 1/2 is approximately 3 to 10 minutes.  
  

* * *

**Elderly  
**The clearance is reduced approximately 25%.  
FDA pregnancy category C.

* * *

**Contraindications:** It has glycine, so contraindicated for epidural or intrathecal administration.  
Patients with known hypersensitivity to fentanyl analogs.
