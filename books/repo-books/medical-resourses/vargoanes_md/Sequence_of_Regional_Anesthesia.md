### Sequence of Regional Anesthesia

If you review the file “Local Anesthetics on A,B and C Nerve Fibers,” you will see that there is a sequence of events (symptoms) while nerve fibers are being blocked one by one.  
  
**Sequence of Local Anesthetic Block**  
1 st blocked: the small postganglionic sympathetic fiber  
2 nd blocked: Sensory nerve fibers  
3 rd blocked (last) motor fibers  
  
Remember, the small postganglionic sympathetic fibers are blocked first most readily, followed by sensory and finally motor fibers.  
  
**Sequence  
**Sympathetic block resulting with peripheral vasodilation and increased skin temperature  
**(increased blood flow to cutaneous tissues)  
**          **↓**  
Loss of pain and temperature sensation  
          **↓**  
Inability to feel sharp pain-needle prick  
          **↓**  
Loss of proprioception  
(unable to tell where affected limbs are)  
          **↓**  
Loss of touch and pressure sensation  
          **↓**  
Motor Paralysis
