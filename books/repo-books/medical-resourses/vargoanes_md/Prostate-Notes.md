### Prostate Notes

The Prostate gland sits under the bladder and in front of the rectum. The urethra runs directly through the donut-shaped prostate.

**Function:** Secretes a slightly alkaline fluid that forms part of the seminal fluid, a fluid that carries sperm. The prostate is the size of a walnut and weighs around 11 grams; with a weight range from 7-16 grams. The prostate gland has three lobes: a center lobe and one lobe on each side. It has 2 seminal vesicles that secrete about 60% of the substances that make up semen. Running alongside and attached to the sides of the prostate are the nerves that control erectile function.  
So if any part of the prostate becomes enlarged, it decreases the diameter of the urethra and can restrict or limit the flow of urine leaving the bladder.

**Nerve-sparing Prostatectomy: T**he surgeon attempts to spare the posterolateral neurovascular bundles which supply the cavernosa nerves of the penis which controls erection. These nerves run next to the prostate and may be destroyed during surgery, leading to impotence.

**Concerns: TUR Syndrome** aka Irrigation Fluid Solute Toxicity

**_Today, with Bipolar technology and using isotonic NSS, TUR Syndrome has become very rare._**  
 

We all had to study TUR Syndrome in school. During a TURP, the urology team has to continuously irrigate the bladder to maintain visibility through the cystoscope. The Prostate has an extensive venous plexus that can absorb the irrigating fluid. Usually only about 20mLs is absorbed. Water was once used that contained Glycine. With a prolonged case, the extra absorption could cause “water intoxication” leading to hyponatremia and hypervolemia. If this was not identified and treated early, it was sometimes fatal.  

**Symptoms and complications of TUR Syndrome during Anesthesia:**  
Cyanosis, seizure, bradycardia (vagal response), prolonged QRS, HYPO/HYPERtension.  
Hemolysis of RBCs.  
Cerebral edema.  
CHF  
Pulmonary edema.  
Tachycardia  
V-Fib (when the Na < 120mEq/L).  
Disorientation  
Nausea  
Vomiting  
Fatigue  
Seizures  
 

**Treatment of TUR Syndrome**  
Tell the surgeon to stop or quickly finish the procedure.  
Ask the surgeon how much Lasix he/she wants you to administer (he/she will have their own protocol).  
Stop your IV bag and change it to hypertonic saline.  
Maintain your airway and oxygenation.  
Quickly draw a BMP to verify Na+ levels per surgeon’s request.  
  
   
**Bladder Spasms:**  
Many patients wake up repeating, “I have to Pee,” experiencing cramping and the painful urge to urinate despite the Foley catheter in place. This is from the involuntary contraction of the bladder (detrusor contraction).

  
**Treatment of Bladder Spasms:**  
B &O Suppository given at the end of the procedure. It does not prevent the spasm; the patient just does not feel it. You may give Robinul 0.2 mg if not contraindicated.  
 

**Prostatism:** This involves a decreased urinary force due to obstruction of flow through the prostate gland.  The most common cause of Prostatism is BPH.

  
**Prostatitis:** Prostatitis is inflammation or infection of the prostate gland, characterized by discomfort, pain, frequent or infrequent urination, and sometimes fever.

**Prostatalgia:** This involves pain in the prostate gland, also called prostatodynia.  It's frequently a symptom of prostatitis, but it is not related to bacteria. S/S include fever, chills, lower back pain, and dysuria.
