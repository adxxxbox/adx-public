### Micra Leadless Pacemaker and Pre-op Programming

Also known as MICRA TPS (Transcatheter Pacemaker System)  
  
\- The Micra TPS is a miniaturized leadless single-chamber right ventricular pacemaker.  
\- It is inserted directly into the right ventricular myocardium via a transcatheter approach.  
\- This new pacemaker technology is a promising long-term permanent cardiac pacing option for patients requiring only RV pacing.  
\- FDA approved for Class I and Class II bradycardia therapy in 2016.  
\- Has an estimated longevity of 12 years.

However, the Micra cannot be reprogrammed to an asynchronous mode with a magnet due to its intracardiac location.  
It must be reprogrammed preoperatively by a Medtronic representative before surgical procedures that may be potentially exposed to electromagnetic interference (EMI).  
**  
Reprogram to VOO (asynchronous) mode:  
**VOO mode can be used perioperatively in pacemaker-dependent patients to prevent EMI-induced inhibition of pacing therapy.  
  
**Medtronic contact info:**

**Model numbers:** MC2AVR1, MC2VR01, MC1AVR1, MC1VR01  
  
**About the MICRA pacemaker:  
Facts: Smallest pacemaker:** Micra is 93% smaller than conventional pacemakers, about the size of a large vitamin capsule.  
**Mass =** 1.75 grams  
**Volume** \= 0.8 cm 3  
**Length** \= 25.9 mm  
  
**Less invasive:** Unlike conventional pacemakers, the procedure requires no chest incision and does not require anesthesia services for insertion.  
It does not create a scar or bump under the skin.  
  
**Fewer restrictions:** The Micra design translates to fewer medical complications and post-implant activity restrictions for most patients.  
  
**Micra indications:**  
\- Symptomatic high-grade atrioventricular nodal block with or without atrial fibrillation, symptomatic bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome.  
\- Sick sinus syndrome.

**Pre-op recommendations when there is a concern for EMI:  
**\- As mentioned above, this pacemaker is not responsive to an external magnet like traditional pacemakers.\- Medtronic recommends considering preoperative asynchronous programming and restoring device parameters after the surgery.  
**  
In urgent cases where preoperative reprogramming is not possible, general procedures should be followed as outlined below:**  
\- Temporary pacing and defibrillation equipment in the operating room.  
\- Brief the surgeon about unique pacemaker and advice to use a bipolar electrocautery system or harmonic scalpel.  
\- If a bipolar electrocautery system is not available, position the return electrode patch such that the electrical current pathway does not pass within 15 cm (6 in) of the device.  
\- Use short, intermittent, and irregular bursts at the lowest clinically appropriate energy levels.  
**  
Pre-op  
Consider postoperative interrogation if the following occurred:**  
\- Monopolar electrocautery was used.  
\- The patient is hemodynamically unstable.  
\- After cardiothoracic surgery, radiofrequency ablation, or external cardioversion  
\- A cardiac electrophysiologist team needs to be contacted to reprogram the pacemaker to VOO (fixed ventricular pacing) mode.  
  
**The main pacing modes of the Micra TPS:**  
VVIR  
VVI  
  
**VOO (asynchronous) mode:  
**\- The VOO mode is rarely used in the presence of an intrinsic rhythm due to the risk of R-on-T phenomenon.\- However, the VOO mode can be used perioperatively in pacemaker-dependent patients to prevent electromagnetic interference-induced inhibition of pacing therapy.  
  
The Micra pacemaker has 63% fewer complications than conventional pacemakers.  
  
**Most common device-related complications:**  
\- Device dislodgement (1.7%)  
\- Cardiac perforation (1.3%)  
\- Elevated pacing thresholds requiring device repositioning (1.3%)
