**Microlaryngoscopy tube or MLT Tube**

The nickname for MLT is "mighty long tube"!

The ENT surgeon prefers an extra-long and small-diameter ETT to facilitate the view of the airway for microlaryngoscopy procedures.

  

4.0-5.0-or 6.0-ID mm microlaryngeal tracheal (MLT) tube (Mallinckrodt Critical Care) is the same length as an adult tube, has a disproportionately large high volume low pressure cuff, and is stiffer and less prone to compression than a regular tracheal tube.
