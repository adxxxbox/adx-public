### Glucose Levels During CABG

The goal is to keep blood glucose below 150 mg/dl.  
  
Protocols vary among hospitals. An insulin infusion is administered, adjusted according to blood glucose.  
Increased fasting glucose levels prior to, during and after cardiac surgery are predictive for increased perioperative morbidity and mortality in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients.  
  
Patients treated with tight glycemic control had significantly higher cardiac indices and less need for inotropic support.  
  
**Tighter glycemic control also resulted in a lower incidence of:**  
Infection rate  
Atrial fibrillation  
Hospital length of stay  
Mortality  
Morbidity  
  
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a significant five-year survival advantage following CABG using tight glycemic control.
