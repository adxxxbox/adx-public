**Hypotension  
**(defined as 20-30% decrease in blood pressure or symptomatic decrease in blood pressure usually presenting as nausea and vomiting)  
  
This is due to the sympathetic blockade and arterial and venous dilation.  
  
Consider a co-load of 500ml IV fluids while placing epidural as a preventative measure.  
  
Left uterine displacement. (hypotension is accentuated by aortocaval compression and an upright/semi-upright position)  
Supplemental O2.  
  
If heart rate < 70, treat with ephedrine 5-15mg.  
If heart rate >70, treat with phenylephrine 50-100mcg. Use incremental doses.
