### Entropion Correction

**Entropion:** The opposite of an Ectropion, an Entropion is the turning in of an edge of an eyelid, causing the eye lashes to rub against the eye. This results in ocular surface irritation and damage that usually affects the lower lid; corneal abrasions and scarring may occur. It may be congenital, acute, spastic, involutional or cicatrical.  
**Anesthetic:** General, usually an LMA or MAC with alfentanil prior localization.  
  
**Duration:** 60 minutes  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 22G is acceptable. A 500mL NS bag with micro drip tubing is popular.  
**Position:** Supine with arms tucked and the patient remains on the same stretcher. Make sure the ETCO2 NC is looped away from the surgical eye. The stretcher is parked 90-180 degrees away from you (unless you are starting out as a general).
