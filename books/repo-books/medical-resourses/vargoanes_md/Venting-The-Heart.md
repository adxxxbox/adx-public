### Venting the Heart

**Aortic root vent** can also be used to administer cardioplegic solution after the ascending aorta is clamped.  
  
**The left ventricular vent line is** a catheter placed in the right superior pulmonary vein/left atrial junction. It may be passed through the mitral valve into the left ventricle. It decompresses (removes blood) from the left ventricle.  
Blood keeps accumulating in the left ventricle because of a direct opening of the thebesian veins and bronchial arteries into the left ventricle. This may compromise myocardial preservation by removing cardioplegia solution and warming the myocardium. This blood is removed by a catheter inserted into the left ventricle via the right superior pulmonary vein.  
  
**Venting the main pulmonary artery** decompresses the left atrium because the pulmonary veins lack valves.  
  
**Direct venting of the left ventricle at the apex.****  
Pulmonary Artery and Aortic Root Vents.**  
  
The selection of these cannulae varies among institutions, and depends on the preferred vent placement and cannula.
