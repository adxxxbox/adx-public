Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE)

A TEE uses ultrasound technology to get a better assessment of the heart. Part of the esophagus anatomically borders the posterior left atrium and can be as close as 1cm. Passing an ultrasound probe from the oral cavity into that section of the esophagus permits a great minimally invasive beat to beat cardiac assessment.

The TEE probe looks similar to an endoscopy probe used in the GI lab, except the TEE probe has a transducer that sends high-frequency sound waves through the esophagus and heart. As the waves bounce (or "echo") off the structures in the heart, the sound waves are translated into live moving images on a monitor.

Many TEEs are performed without anesthesia by using conscious sedation. When anesthesia is involved, we usually use Propofol.  
Concerning anesthesia, these are usually MAC cases like doing an EGD- but longer in duration. The cardiologist will pass a probe down into the esophagus (not stomach) and positions the probe closest to the heart.

Unfortunately, many of the cases we are involved with have very sick hearts with low ejection fractions (EF). Therefore, minimally sedating these patients to protect their limited cardiac reserve while simultaneously keeping them comfortable is your greatest challenge.

**Pre-op  
**Your biggest concern is to find out what the patient's EF is and why they are performing the TEE. Many of these patients also have Atrial Fibrillation and the cardiologist wants to perform a TEE to check for the presence of an atrial thrombi. Overall, the patient's EF will dictate how much sedation and/or propofol you administer.  
  
**Equipment:** Always have emergency airway and cardiac meds available, especially for the patients with a low cardiac reserve.  
Ephedrine, diluted vasopressin and Epi is preferred over neosynephrine for patients with little cardiac reserve. Neosynephrine is used for hypotension secondary to a decreased SVR.

**Numb the back of the throat  
**Have the patient gargle viscous lidocaine for 30-60 seconds and then swallow. This may significantly reduces the amount of propofol needed.

**Anesthesia:** Usually MAC  
**Note:** Most of the stimulation is when the probe is inserted. Once the probe is settled in place with the esophagus-stimulation is minimal.  
  
**Position:** Head of bed up 25-30%; most patients are left lateral, some are supine.  
  
**Sedation doses depends on the patient's EF (cocktails vary)  
EF < 15% cocktails:  
**2mg versed and 10 mg increments of ketamine as needed is common  
No propofol and 15mg of Etomidate and 1-2 mg versed  
  
**EF 30-50%  
**1-2 mg of versed, 10 mg increments of ketamine with low doses of propofol.  
**Normal EF:** Propofol as needed -- like an EGD**Duration:** 5-30 minutes  
**Bite Block:** yes  
**Lidocaine Bolus:** No, as mentioned above - numbing spray or gargling a viscous lidocaine works better.**Antisialagogues:** 0.1 mg of robinul for a non-compromised heart**.  
IV Access:** At least a 20g catheter in case emergency meds are needed.

**Airway issues:**  
Do not hesitate to manipulate the airway (jaw thrust) if the patient starts to obstruct during the procedure. Do not hesitate to tell the cardiologist to pull out the probe if you can't manage the airway. Don't feel bad; I could assure you it is not the first time. The doctor may continue when the SaO2 returns to a safe level

**Bite Block Removal**  
When the procedure is complete, do not remove the bite block until the patient can follow commands and open their mouth. You can damage the patient's teeth pulling the bite block out too soon.  

**Possible Complications  
**\- Pharyngeal and/or laryngeal trauma  
\- Laryngeal spasm while advancing the tube  
\- Esophageal perforation  
\- Damaged teeth  
\- Submucosal hematoma  
\- Severe hypotension with sedation with patients having a low EF  
\- Cardiac Arrest  
\- Perioperative death  

**More Notes  
****Indications of TEE**

**For assessment of:**  
Assess the overall function of your heart's valves and chambers

**Assess many types of heart disease:**  
\- Valve disease  
\- Myocardial or Coronary heart disease  
\- Pericardial disease  
\- Infective endocarditis  
\- Cardiac masses  
\- Congenital heart disease  
\- Evaluate the effectiveness of valve surgery  
\- Evaluate abnormalities of the left atrium  
\- Evaluate blood flow across the heart's valves  
\- Assess for Aortic aneurysm  
\- Assess for Endocarditis  
\- Assess for Cardiomyopathy  

**Atrial Fib and TEEs**  
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia. During AF the atria “quiver” rather than contract normally, leading to stasis of blood in the atria and the potential for a thrombus formation. The left atrial appendage is the most common spot for clot formation. If this clot embolizes to the brain, it can cause a stroke. The average stroke risk in AF patients without anticoagulation is 4.5% per year. TEEs are commonly used to assess these left atrial clots.

**Patients have a higher risk during a TEE from the following:  
**\- History of throat problems  
\- History of radiation therapy to the throat  
\- History of esophageal varices  
\- History of strictures or narrowing of the esophagus
