### Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI)

Not to be confused with “Revised Goldman Cardiac Risk Index.”  
**MACE:** Major adverse cardiac event  
**Perioperative:** At or around the time of surgeryWith RCRI, perioperative refers to “admission prior to surgery to 30-days post-op.**  
  
The RCRI is a simple, validated, and accepted tool to assess the perioperative risk of major cardiac complications:**  
\- MI  
\- Pulmonary edema  
\- Ventricular fibrillation or primary cardiac arrest  
\- Complete heart block  
  
\- The RCRI is one of the cardiac risk indexes utilized in the _“2014 ACC/AHA Guideline on Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation and Management of Patients Undergoing Noncardiac Surgery.”  
_\- The index is usually directed at adult patients of 50 years of age or older undergoing noncardiac surgery because that was the age people were involved in most of the studies.  
  
**RCRI uses six clinical risk predicting values:**  
Of the six predictors of risk for major cardiac complications, only 1 of which is based on the surgical procedure—namely, “Undergoing suprainguinal vascular, intraperitoneal, or intrathoracic surgery.”  
**A patient with 0 or 1 predictor(s) of risk:** Have low risk of MACE.  
**Patients with ≥ 2 predictors of risk:** Have elevated risk  
  
**Revised Cardiac Risk Index for perioperative MACE is a 6-point system.

| **0 points** | 0.4% risk of perioperative MACE  
(30-day risk since surgery)  
Some studies: 0.04 to 1.5% |
| **1 points** | 0.9% risk of perioperative MACE  
(30-day risk since surgery)  
Some studies: 0.3 to 2.1% |
| **2 points** | 6.6% risk of perioperative MACE  
(30-day risk since surgery)  
Some studies: 3.9 to 10.3% |
| **3 to 6 points** | 11.1 % risk of perioperative MACE  
(30-day risk since surgery)  
Some studies: 5.8 to 18.4% |

  
**Low risk < 1%:** No further testing and go straight to surgery**High risk:** Assess the patient’s functional capacity (METs)  
  
**Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)-STEMI or NSTEMI:  
**_Emergent or not, all patients experiencing ACS should not proceed to a noncardiac surgery and evaluated and treated as per current guidelines  
  
_For any patient with unstable or new cardiac symptoms, you should abandon the cardiac preoperative assessment and get an immediate cardiac consult for further evaluation.  
  
**RCI Facts and statistics:  
**\- 50% of perioperative deaths are cardiac  
\- Perioperative MI’s have up to a 50% mortality rate  
\- Most occur within 72 hours post-op (peak is 48 hours)  
\- Overall perioperative mortality is 0.3%  
\- Cardiac etiologies are the most common cause of death  
\- Pulmonary etiologies are the most common cause of complications  
\- Extubation is the time of risk for flare up of reactive airways  
\- Most perioperative MI’s present as atypical and are NonQ MIs (NonStemi)  
\- High-risk patients should undergo a more extensive preoperative evaluation and optimized prior to surgery.  
  
\- It is not uncommon to postpone an elective noncardiac procedure until further evaluation.  
\- Cardiac clearance is highly recommended with any history of MI.  
\- By combining risk scores with a patient’s comorbidities with the complexity of surgery, we can stratify overall risk for a perioperative major adverse _cardiac_ events MACE.
