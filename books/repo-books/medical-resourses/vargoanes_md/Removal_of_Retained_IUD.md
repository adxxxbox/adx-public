Removal of Retained IUD    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Removal of Retained IUD

**IUD:** Intrauterine device -for birth control  
  
**Surgical indication:**  
Failed in-office IUD removal.  
Removal attempts not tolerated by the patient (in-office)  
  
**In-office reasons for failure to locate or remove IUD:  
**\- Unrecognized spontaneous expulsion  
\- Unable to visualize the strings extending into the cervical os  
\- Fragmentation inside the uterine cavity or cervical canal  
\- Myometrial embedding  
\- Migration into the abdominal cavity  
  
**Note:**  
\- If transvaginal ultrasound confirms intrauterine placement of the IUD without concern for myometrial embedding, additional efforts can be made for outpatient removal.  
\- Hysteroscopic-guided removal of IUD is a superior option for management when ultrasound-guided removal fails.  
  
**Surgical procedure for removal of a retained IUD:**  
**Duration:** Usually 5 minutes  
\- It may require a hysteroscope removal after the vaginal exam.  
\- If the IUD cannot be located, an X-ray of the abdomen and pelvis will be immediately performed.  
  
**IUD abdominal migration:** Rare  
\- A laparoscopic procedure will need to be performed  
\- The patient will need to be intubated  
\- Hopefully, this additional procedure will be on the patient’s consent  
  
**When a laparotomy is preferred:** Rare\- Bowel perforation  
\- Sepsis  
\- Inability to remove laparoscopically  
  
**Most common intra-abdominal location for the migrated IUD:**  
Omentum  
Broad ligament  
  
**Anesthesia management:**  
Usually MAC  
Continuous propofol infusion (titrate to effect).  
  
**Duration:** Usually 5 minutes**EBL:** Minimal**Antibiotics:** Not indicated**  
  
Common cocktail:**  
1-2 mg midazolam  
50 -100 mcg of Fentanyl with 50-150 mcg/kg/min of propofol.  
Consider a small bolus of propofol just prior to cervical dilation.  
  
**Position:** Lithotomy with arms out (slight Trendelenburg)  
Caution: Patients with moderate to severe GERD may be an aspiration risk in mild.  
The OR staff will NOT position the patient in lithotomy until she is asleep.  
  
**Regional anesthesia option:** Paracervical (rarely performed for this)  
  
**Possible complications:  
**Bleeding  
Infection  
Damage or perforation of the uterus
