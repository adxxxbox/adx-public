### Methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol)

**Solu-Medrol**  
**10-30mg/kg or 0.5-1 gram after induction.**  
  
Has fallen into disuse due to its hyperglycemic and immunosuppressive effects. Administered only when specifically ordered by surgeon.  
  
**Dose:** 10-30mg/kg or 0.5-1 gram.  
May be given after induction.  
  
Pre-operative administration of methylprednisolone has decreased TNFa, IL-6 and IL-8 release, and increased the perfusing IL-10 levels after CPB. Thus, Solu-Medrol may decrease the inflammatory response during the CPB procedure.
