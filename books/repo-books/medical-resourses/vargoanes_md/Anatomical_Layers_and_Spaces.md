### Anatomical Layers and Spaces

**When the skin is penetrated via “midline approach” the layers below from the skin to the spinal cord are listed below:  
**Skin  
Subcutaneous (superficial) Tissue  
Supraspinous Ligament  
Interspinous Ligament  
Ligamentum Flavum  
Epidural Space  
Dura mater  
Subdural Space - not talked about much - can have inadvertent catheter insertion here  
Arachnoid Mater  
Subarachnoid Space  
Pia mater  
Spinal cord  
  
**Midline approach:** The most common approach. The needle or introducer is inserted through the skin midline, perpendicular and between the spinous processes, aiming slightly cephalad.  
  
**Paramedian approach  
**The spinal needle is placed 1.5 cm laterally from the location of a median approach. The needle is aimed medially and slightly cephalad.  
The needle laterally bypasses the supraspinous and interspinous ligament. If the lamina is contacted, the needle is redirected and "walked off" in a medial and cephalad direction.
