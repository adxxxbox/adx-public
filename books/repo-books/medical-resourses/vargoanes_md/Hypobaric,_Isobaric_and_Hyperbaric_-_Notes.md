### Hypobaric, Isobaric & Hyperbaric Notes

Spinals for C-sections are almost all HYPER-baric  
**Hypobaric, Isobaric and Hyperbaric** only refers to spinals and has NO effect in epidurals.

The specific gravity of the CSF is 1.003-1.008. That is what we compare local anesthetics to when determining their baracity.Isobaric local anesthetics are equal in density of the CSF-they are both 1.003-1.008.  
**Density -** weight of 1 ml of solution in grams at a standard temperature.  
**Specific Gravity** \- density of a solution in a ratio, compared to the density of water.  
**Baracity** \- the ratio comparing the density of one solution to another.  
**Density/baracity** \- the density or baracity of the local anesthetic exerts one of the greatest effects  
on subsequent height of the block.  
Local anesthetic (LA) movement within CSF is dependent on its specific gravity in relation to CSF, which at 37 degrees C is 1.003-1.008.  
  
**Hypobaric Solutions  
**Hypobaric solutions can be compared to as helium to air.  
Hypobaric solutions are created by adding sterile water- creates a baracity < 0.9990.  
Hypobaric solutions means that the solution is lighter (less dense) than CSF. This will allow it to move in a cephalad direction within the CSF.  
It can be compared to as helium to air.  
Hypobaric LAs have a baracity of < or = to 1.  
  
**Hypobaric Local Anesthetics and Positioning  
**During the first few minutes after the injection of a hypobaric LA, the patient’s positioning strongly determines how it spreads in the CSF. If the patient is in Trendelenburg (head down) after injection, the hypobaric LA will spread caudal, and it will spread cephalad in reverse Trendelenburg-both opposite to gravity- like helium.  
If in the lateral position, it spread to the non-dependent area.  
The prone/jack knife position will result in blockade of the lower lumbar and sacral areas.  
  
**Bupivicaine, Tetracaine and** **Dibucaine** can be used as hypobaric solutions in spinal anesthesia.However, hypobaric LAs are more optimal for a perineal or rectal procedure. Immediately after injection, placing the patient in the prone- jackknife position, the hypobaric LA should defy gravity and rise to that area.

| Hypobaric | Density | Specific Gravity | Baracity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lidocaine in 0.5% in water | NA | 1 | 0.99 |
| Tetracaine in 0.33% water | 0.99 | 1 | 0.99 |

**Isobaric Local Anesthetics  
**Are equal in density (thus weight) of the CSF-they are both 1.0.  
  
**Isobaric local anesthetics and positioning  
**Remain in the general area where it was injected.  
This means positioning has no to little effect after injection.  
  
**An isobaric local anesthetic can become a hypobaric or hyperbaric**  
An isobaric local anesthetic can be converted to hyperbaric local anesthetic by adding glucose or dextrose (like adding more sugar to your tea). The local anesthetic becomes more concentrated and dense compared to the CSF.  
  
Tetracaine and bupivacaine can be used as a isobaric LA.

| Isobaric LAs | Density | Specific Gravity | Baracity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bupivacaine in 0.5% water | 0.99 | 1 | 1 |
| Lidocaine in 2% water | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 0.5% Tetracaine in 50% CSF | 0.99 | 1 | 0.99 |

**Isobaric 0.5% Bupivacaine NOT used in spinals  
**Isobaric 0.5% Bupivacaine with water is rarely used because it is NOT FDA approved for SPINALS. It is written on the vial. There are still some anesthesia providers who use isobaric Bupivicaine.  
  
**Hyperbaric Local Anesthetics and Spinals  
**As mentioned on the top of this page, we almost always use hyperbaric local anesthetics in spinals for C-sections.  
Hyperbaric LAs are denser than CSF and tends to follow gravity after injection.  
Hyperbaric LAs have a baracity > 1 (1.008).  
Adding dextrose or glucose to an isobaric LA will convert it to hyperbaric.  
  
Hyperbaric Bupivacaine (Marcaine), Lidocaine and Tetracaine have all been used in spinal anesthesia.  
  
**Hyperbaric Local Anesthetics Used in Spinals for C-sections  
**_0.5% or 0.75% Bupivacaine with 8.25% Dextrose (already mixed in a vial) is the most common hyperbaric LA used in the US for C-sections._  
  
**5% (NOT 0.5%) Lidocaine with 7.5% Dextrose** for single injection spinals is now used less often due to TNS (transient neurologic symptoms) and cauda equina syndrome after continuous spinal anesthesia.  
**0.5% Tetracaine with 5% Dextrose** is rarely used for spinals, Many institutions do not even stock it.  
  
**Positioning with Hyperbaric LAs**  
Immediate positioning plays an important role concerning the targeted dermatomes being effected. This is why you see anesthesia providers positioning their C-section patients immediately after a spinal injection in the supine position and avoiding Trendelenburg.  
  
**Lateral position** \- a hyperbaric solution will spread towards the dependent area.  
**Supine:** Immediately after injection the hyperbaric local anesthetic will move toward the T4-T8 area. The apex, following the normal curvature of the spine, is T4.

**Supine Trendelenburg -** hyperbaric solution will spread further reaching thoracic dermatomes.  
  
**Remained sitting up immediately after injection,** the sacral and lower lumbar distribution will have a dense block.  
  
Once the spinal sets up in around 10 minutes, repositioning does little.  
**Example:** A C-section patient in the supine position for around 10 minutes after injection having numbness in both arms. It is not effective to place them in reverse Trendelenburg. The damage is done. This is why you don’t see reverse Trendelenburg curing a total spinal.
