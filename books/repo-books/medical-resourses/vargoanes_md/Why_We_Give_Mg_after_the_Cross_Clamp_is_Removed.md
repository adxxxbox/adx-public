Why We Give Mg after the Cross Clamp is Removed    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Rationale For Administering Magnesium After The Cross Clamp Is Removed

Magnesium depletion occurs during CPB if hemofiltration is used or if there is high volume diuresis, especially using furosemide (Lasix).  
  
A 2mg bolus is usually given after the blood is rewarmed and the cross clamp has been removed.  
  
It can be given by the perfusionist or by the anesthesia provider. If the Mg++ levels are available with current lab values, the Mg++ dose should be titrated according to blood levels.
