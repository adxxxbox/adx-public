### Epidural Top Off - Definition

**Epidural Top Off, Top On, Rescue Medications and Re-Bolus-Are All The Same  
  
**“Epidural Top Off,” “Rescue Medications,” “Top On” and “Re-Bolus” are synonymous.  
  
A parturient with an epidural, may start to feel pain as labor progresses despite being on a PCEA. We are often called to manually administer an extra dose and possibly increase the PCEA basal rate. The extra bolus we administer is called a “Top Off.”  
  
You can even accomplish this with certain infusion pumps by administering an extra bolus from your infusion bag.  
  
Top Offs vary among anesthesia providers.
