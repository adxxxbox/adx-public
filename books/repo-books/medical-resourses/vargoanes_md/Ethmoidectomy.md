Ethmoidectomy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Ethmoidectomy

The ethmoid sinuses are opened surgically to create one large cavity, which drains directly down into the nose. No matter the approach, the ethmoid sinus is the key or essential element in the surgical treatment of sinusitis. The ethmoid sinus is important because all of the other sinuses drain either through or adjacent to this sinus.

Disease within or extending beyond the ethmoid can obstruct the ability of air to enter the affected sinus and for mucous to drain. Ethmoid sinuses are located between your eyes and are a honeycomb of 13 to 20 individual sinuses, each with its own individual opening.

**Indications:** Chronic sinusitis unresponsive to antibiotics and/or irrigation of the sinuses.

Biopsy or removal of a mass or polyp within the sinuses.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT with an oral Rae and consider an LTA kit.  
**Muscle Relaxant:** Theoretically, the patient does not need to be relaxed, but we usually do to prevent coughing.  
**Inhalation Agent:** Sevo or Forane are popular for these procedures.

**Duration:** 45-90 minutes.  
**EBL:** 50-150 mLs.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
**Positioning:** Supine, HOB up 10-20 degrees or reverse Trendelenburg. Tuck the arm on the side of the bed that the surgeon sits on. Sometimes the bed is rotated 90 degrees.

**Antiemetics:** Yes, Decadron and Zofran are a great idea.

**NGT:** For the surgeon to pass ORALLY after the throat pack is out.  
**Avoid hypertension:** To minimize bleeding, but stay within 20% of the base. Consider a beta-blocker with emergence. You can titrate your inhalation agent to the desired BP.  
**Emergence:** Smooth; avoid bucking. Give Lidocaine .25mg/kg which decreases coughing.

**Robinul:** Yes, to prevent secretions from draining and agitating the vocal cords.

Gently suction the oral pharynx with a catheter (not a Yankauer). At the end of the operation, it is usual practice to have a pack or sponge dressing in each nostril to soak up any blood. This is kept in for a few hours. The patient is now an obligate mouth breather.  
**Extubation:** Deep or Awake? Many CRNAs will extubate deep with the HOB elevated.  
Some CRNAs insert an LMA immediately after a deep extubation and transport the patient to the recovery room. The LMA is removed when the patient awakes. This drastically decreases turnover time.

 **Possible Complications:**  
 Bleeding  
 Blindness  
 Eye Muscle Injury.  
 Spinal Fluid Leak.  
 Meningitis  
 Infection

After the sinuses are completely healed, there is an 80 to 95% chance the patient’s sinus problems will be significantly better.

**Spinal Fluid Leak:**

If the surgeon notices the leakage of spinal fluid, he/she will stop the procedure and the patient will be admitted for observation.
