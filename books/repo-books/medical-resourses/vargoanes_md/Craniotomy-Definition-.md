### Craniotomy: Definition

Craniotomy is any bony opening that is cut into the skull. During surgery, a section of the skull called a bone flap is removed to access the brain underneath. A craniotomy may be small or large depending on the problem. It may be performed to treat tumors, hematomas (blood clots), aneurysms, AVMs, skull fractures, foreign objects (bullets), swelling of the brain, or infection. The bone flap is usually replaced with tiny plates and screws.
