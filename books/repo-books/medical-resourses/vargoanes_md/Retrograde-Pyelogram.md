Retrograde Pyelogram     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Retrograde Pyelogram

Usually done with a cystoscope. This is a procedure in which the urologist injects a contrast dye into one ureteral orifices or both, then X-raying the patient in an effort to get a clearer view of the ureter(s) and the kidneys. The dye makes it easier for the physician to diagnose any abnormalities. The dye then travels from the bladder to the kidney(s) in the opposite direction of the usual flow of urine, hence the phrase ‘retrograde’. Retrograde refers to the flow of the dye.  
**Anesthetic:** General/usually an LMA, sometimes ETT. You will need a lead apron.  
Spinal is rare but optional (T8-T10 level).  
**Duration:** 20 -60 minutes.   
**Position:** Lithotomy  
**EBL:** Minimal  
  
**Complications:** Perforation or a tear anywhere along the urinary tract: the urethra, bladder, or ureter. The risk of perforation increases with the complexity of the procedure being performed. Most perforations can be managed.

**Perforation of the Bladder:** Considered an emergency and GETA. The patient will require an exploratory laparotomy. If the irrigation fluid fails to return or a lot less is returning than what went in, the surgeon needs to consider a perforation. Large perforations can lead to unexplained hemodynamic changes such as hyper- or hypo-tension, bradycardia due to a vagal response, or cardiac collapse.  
An awake patient under a regional block may feel suprapubic fullness and pain in the upper abdomen, referred pain from the diaphragm to the shoulders, nausea and/or diaphoresis.
