# Factor VII

**Factor VII (NovoSeven)**  
(Recumbanant)  
Rarely used  
Factor VII is the key initiator of coagulation.  
**Doses**  
**For bleeding episodes for hemophilia A or B patients with Inhibitors:**  
Bolus 90 mcg/kg Q2-3h  
Doses 35 -120 mcg/kg  
**Surgical Interventions**  
An initial dose of 90 mcg/kg given immediately before the intervention and repeated at 2-hour intervals for the duration of the surgery.  
**MOA**  
An intrinsic membrane glycoprotein on the surface of intact blood vessels.  
When the vascular lumen is damaged, tissue factor is exposed and then binds to the small amounts of circulating factors VIIa and VII. This facilitates conversion of factor VII to factor VIIa and initiates the clotting mechanism.  
**Anesthesia Indications:**  
Treatment of bleeding episodes in hemophilia A or B patients with inhibitors to Factor VIII or Factor IX and in patients with acquired hemophilia.  
Prevention of bleeding in surgical interventions or invasive procedures in hemophilia A or B patients with inhibitors to Factor VIII or Factor IX and in patients with acquired hemophilia.  
Treatment of bleeding episodes in patients with congenital Factor VII deficiency.
