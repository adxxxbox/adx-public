AAA (Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm) (Open)     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### AAA-Ruptured

**Mortality Rates:** A ruptured AAA is very fatal.  
  
**Overall:** 65% mortality; probably higher.  
**If the patient makes it alive to the hospital:** 36% mortality still exists.  
A Non-ruptured elective repair carries a 6% mortality rate.  
  
Symptoms:  
Lower abdominal or lumbar pain in the presence of a pulsatile abdominal mass.  
Collapse, shock and coma.  
  
**Quick Pre-Op Assessment:**  
You need to know that many of these patients have extensive atherosclerotic, smoking-related diseases, undiagnosed CAD, DM, HTN and renal impairment.  
  
Check a noninvasive BP in both arms. If there is a different reading, use the higher reading. This is a check for brachiocephalic and subclavian artery stenosis.  
  
**Actions:** Insert an A-line if possible.  
Place 2-3 Large bore IVs.  
Plan for a Swan insertion pre or post induction.  
  
In the meantime, your colleagues or techs should be preparing the room and getting blood and coagulation products ready.  
Plan on starting with 10 units of PRBCs.  
Platelets.  
FFP.  
Cryoprecipitate.  
  
Our first response is to usually flood the patient with volume to restore BP. However, too much fluid prior to clamping the aorta will just increase bleeding and dilute the clotting factors.  
Many avoid blood transfusions unless the patient is unconscious or displays signs of myocardial ischemia prior to clamping the aorta.  
If the patient is stable and the coags are normal, an epidural can be placed. This is rare.  
  
**Why your patient can crash with induction:**  
Cardio-depressant effects from the inhalation agent and anesthesia meds.  
Relaxation of abdominal muscles reduces the tamponade effect.  
Positive pressure ventilation decreases venous return.  
Reduction in sympathetic tone.  
  
Connect your fluid warmers and rapid transfuser and have blood ready and spiked before induction.  
  
**Induction:** RSI and Etomidate; consider Ketamine or even Scopolamine .4-.5 mg/kg IV  
**Nitrous Oxide:** NO, because it will reduce BP with patients who already have reduced myocardial contractility or increased levels of sympathoadrenal activity, both of which are frequently present in patients with a ruptured AAA.  
**High dose narcotics:** Fentanyl 5-20 mcgs/kg  
  
  
Aortic Cross Clamping:  
Once the aorta is cross-clamped, an increased afterload may cause HTN above or proximal to the clamp. You should deepen your anesthesia and give dilators. While you are doing this, you can still be fluid loading the patients so you could blunt their BP drop when the clamp is released later.  
  
Renal Function Protection:  
Before or around clamp time, the surgeon may ask you to give Mannitol, Lasix or dopamine to prevent renal failure. There is still no convincing research to this but we still give it.  
  
Unclamping:  
We want to prevent profound hypotension, lactic acidosis, myocardial ischemia and cardiovascular collapse. This can be the result from a decrease in afterload and severe ischemia-reperfusion injury. So make sure your Nitroglycerine is off and your vasopressors and inotropes are ready when the aortic clamp is removed.  
  
Late Operative and Postoperative Considerations:  
These patients frequently get facial, scalp, and airway edema. With all the edema, extubation is not recommended until the edema subsides. Elevating the patient’s HOB  
overnight helps.  
  
**More Notes:**  
Patients with a ruptured AAA have pain and restlessness due to an expanding retroperitoneal hematoma.  
Aortic clamping may cause acute lower limb ischemia.  
Buttock pain occurs when the internal iliac artery is occluded.  
Free intra-peritoneal rupture almost invariably results in cardiovascular collapse and death.  
Retroperitoneal rupture has a much better prognosis as a result of the tamponade, which limits further hemorrhage.
