### DLIF or Direct Lateral Interbody Fusion

**MINIMALLY INVASIVE**

Patient is positioned laterally after GETA is established. A C-arm is used to determine the location of the operative site. A small incision is made and tubular dilators are inserted into a safe position.  
Using the assistance of a C-arm and EMG nerve monitoring, the surgeon will advance the dilator to the correct area. Than a tissue retractor is advanced over them that is locked to the surgical table and held open to provide lighted visibility and surgical access to the disc space. The rest is standard for the surgeon.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT

**Duration:** 1-3 hours; it depends on how many levels are being done.  
**Blood Loss:** < 100mLs

**IV Access:** 18G     
**Antibiotics:** Usually Ancef, unless contraindicated.  
**Positioning:**  Lateral with arms out < 90 degrees and dependent side axillary roll.  
**Neuro monitoring:** Depends on your surgeon. You may be required ½ MAC and a Propofol infusion.

**Possible Complications:**  
Spinal cord or nerve root injury.
