V-Fib/V-Tachy    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

**V-Fib/V-Tachy (Cardiac Arrest)**Cardiac arrest perioperatively usually occurs from either hypoxemia or the progression of a circulatory process.  
  

**Avoiding a cardiac arrest usually entails:**  
Managing acute anemia  
Preventing hypoxemia  
Maintain cardiac output, preload, contractility, and afterload

**Diagnosis**

_Always verify there is no pulse before starting CPR._**  
Never rely solely on the EKG reading V-Fib or V-Tachy**  
Is there a pulse? Check Carotid?  
If you have an A-line- is there a tracing?  
Is there a loss of waveform with pulse ox?  
All of the above should correlate

**Treatment:**  
**(1) Call for Anesthesia help and a code cart STAT**  
**(2) Have someone put backboard under patient (supine)** and  
      tell the room "We need to start compressions and shock the patient ASAP."  
**(3) Manage airway on 100% O2** (your job)  
**(4) Start CPR- Defibrillation and Re-Assessment Cycle**  
    **CPR**: Compress 2 inches  
        100 compressions/min  
        If not intubated 30:2 compression to breaths  
        If intubated: 8 breaths per minute (don't over ventilate)

**Crash Cart and Defibrillator Arrives  
**_Place electrodes on chest  
Turn defibrillator ON, set to DEFIB mode  
**Energy Level:** 200J (120J or 150J for smaller patient)  
**Deliver shock:** press CHARGE then press shock_  
**Literature:** 120-200J biphasic Or 360J monophasic  
Resume CPR after shock  
  
**Give Epinephrine**  
Epinephrine 1mg q3-5 minutes  
                 or  
Vasopressin 40 units IV x 1 may replace 1st or 2nd Epinephrine dose

**For Refractory VF/VT consider antiarrhythmics:**  
Amiodarone (1st choice)  
1st Dose 300mg IV  
2nd Dose 150mg IV  
Lidocaine: 1-1.5mg/kg IV q 3-5 minutes x 3  
Magnesium 1-2 grams IV for Torsades de Pointes  
Consider changing CPR compression provider  
  
**Re-Assess every 2 minutes. If rhythm is shockable restart #4  
**(See Asystole/PEA if not shockable)

**Treat reversible causes: (H's and T's)**  
Hypovolemia  
Hypoxia  
H+ (acidosis)  
Hypokalemia or hyperkalemia  
Hypothermia  
Toxins  
Tamponade (cardiac)  
Tension pneumothorax  
Thrombosis (pulmonary, coronary)

**If VF/VT Continues:**  
Restart #4 above

**More Notes**  
The failing LV is best supported with afterload reduction when possible, followed by positive inotropes (Ephedrine, Vasopressin or Epinephrine).  
Neosynephrine is **not** the drug of choice in this scenario.

Some patients will continue to deteriorate despite of your efforts.  
We typically initially administer small boluses of ‘CODE’ drugs in such instances.

**Other Quick Measures with onset of patient deteriorating  
**Evaluation of the surgical procedure  
Rapid trouble shooting of the anesthesia machine & circuit review  
Assess any recent doses of medications or possible med error  
Consider stat portable chest X-ray (or C-Arm) to rule out tension pneumothorax.

Stat TEE or Echo to evaluate the heart for:  
Ventricular filling  
Ventricular function  
Valvular function  
Exclude tamponade  
Consider an H1 and H2 blocker  
Consider a stress dose steroid
