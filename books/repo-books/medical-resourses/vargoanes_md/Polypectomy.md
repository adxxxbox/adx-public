### Polypectomy (Removal of Cervical Polyps)

Cervical polyps are smooth, red, finger-shaped growths in the cervix.  These small growths hang from a stalk and protrude through the cervical opening. Polyps that cause bleeding, discharge, etc. need to be removed. Polyps can be removed either by twisting them off, or by using a hot wire loop. After the polyp is removed, the base is cauterized to stop the bleeding.  
**Anesthetic:** General/LMA, sometimes a deep MAC.  
Spinal: Rare but acceptable.  
**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**Position:** Lithotomy  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
**EBL:** Minimal

**More Notes**  
The base of a cervical polyp can be removed with either an electrical current or a laser. In both cases, the base is burned, which kills the cells and usually prevents the polyp from returning. More than 99% of polyps are benign. Most polyps can be removed in a doctor’s office. Polyps slightly inside the cervix require a D&C. Polyps are rarely seen prior to the onset of menstrual periods. Cervical polyps are commonly found in women over age 20 or in those females who have had at least one child.
