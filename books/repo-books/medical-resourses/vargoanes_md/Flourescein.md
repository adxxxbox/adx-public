Fluorescein (Sodium fluorescein) AK-FLUOR    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

**Fluorescein (Sodium fluorescein)** **AK-FLUOR**  
**Comes in 2 vials, each containing 50 mg:**  
10% Single-dose vials 5ml  
25% Single-dose vial 2 ml  

**Short Summary**  
In anesthesia practice, fluorescein is an IV dye administered by anesthesia providers upon request of the urologist during cystoscopy procedures to identify ureteral orifices to confirm ureteral patency.  
Since the FDA announced a shortage of methylene blue and/or indigo carmine, fluorescein has been used as an alternative with comparable visualization, low risk and economic feasibility.  
Fluorescein has excellent efficacy and minimal side effects. Although rare severe reactions have been reported, most adverse reactions are mild and are associated with larger fluorescein doses.  

**Standard Dose for cystoscopy to verify patent ureters:** 25mg  
**Literature states:** 25-100 mg  
  
**Other Doses for Ophthalmology (not administered by anesthesia)**  
**Adults:** up to 500 mg  
**For children:** the dose should be calculated as 35 mg for each ten pounds of body weight (7.7 mg/kg body weight).  
  
**Side Effects:** Transient yellowing of the sclera and palms.  
  
**Pediatrics**  
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between pediatric and adult patients.  
  
**Contraindications:** In patients with known hypersensitivity to fluorescein sodium or any other ingredients in this product.  
Rare cases of death due to anaphylaxis have been reported.  
  

**Metabolism:**  
Metabolized to fluorescein monoglucuronide. After IV administration of fluorescein sodium (14 mg/kg) to 7 healthy subjects, approximately 80% of fluorescein in plasma was converted to glucuronide conjugate after a period of 1 hour post dose.

**Excretion:**  
Fluorescein and its metabolite are mainly eliminated via renal excretion. After IV administration, the urine remains slightly fluorescent for 24 to 36 hours. A renal clearance of 1.75 mL/min/kg and a hepatic clearance (due to conjugation) of 1.50 mL/min/kg have been estimated. The systemic clearance of fluorescein was essentially complete by 48 to 72 hours after administration of 500 mg fluorescein.  
  
Extravasation during injection can result in severe local tissue damage due to the high pH of fluorescein solution

**Pregnancy Category C.**  
Adequate animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with fluorescein sodium. It is also not known whether fluorescein sodium can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Fluorescein sodium should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

**Breast Milk**  
Fluorescein sodium has been demonstrated to be excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when fluorescein sodium is administered to a nursing woman

**Pediatric Use**  
Pediatric patients have been included in clinical studies. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between pediatric and adult patients.

**More Notes**  
IV indigo carmine and methylene blue result in a dark blue plume of urine at the ureteral meatus. These have been considered standard of care during intraoperative cystoscopy, indigo carmine more so than methylene blue.  
The FDA announced the shortage of indigo carmine in June 2014. Since then, surgeons have been searching for an alternative with comparable visualization, low risk and economically favorable profile.  
  
Fluorescein sodium responds to electromagnetic radiation and light between the wavelengths of 465 to 490 nm and fluoresces, i.e., emits light at wavelengths of 520 to 530 nm. Thus, the hydrocarbon is excited by blue light and emits light that appears yellowish green. Following intravenous injection of fluorescein sodium in an aqueous solution, the unbound fraction of the fluorescein can be excited with a blue light flash from a fundus camera as it circulates through the ocular vasculature, and the yellowish green fluorescence of the dye is captured by the camera. In the fundus, the fluorescence of the dye demarcates the retinal and/or choroidal vasculature under observation, distinguishing it from adjacent areas/structures.  
  
Within 7 to 14 seconds after IV administration into the antecubital vein, fluorescein usually appears in the central retinal artery of the eye. Within a few minutes of IV administration of fluorescein sodium, a yellowish discoloration of the skin occurs, which begins to fade 6 to 12 hours after dosing. Various estimates of volume of distribution indicate that fluorescein distributes into interstitial space (0.5 L/kg).
