A-V Fistula Revision or Arteriogram    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### A-V Fistula Revision or Arteriogram

\- Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) dysfunction is a common problem in hemodialysis patients and remains a significant cause of morbidity and hospitalization.  
\- The diagnosis of inadequate access flow can be confirmed with Doppler-Echo or radiographic imaging.  
\- In recent years, endovascular techniques have become the first-line treatment for AVF dysfunction and have replaced the classical surgical approach.  
  
**Various surgical techniques can be used during an AV fistula revision:****Thrombectomy:** Surgical removal of thrombus from the AV access.  
**Outflow patch angioplasty:** Surgical revision of the venous stenosis with a prosthetic or autogenous patch to correct a stenosed outflow anastomosis.  
**Primary repair:** A stenotic area is resected and anastomosed end-to-end.  
**Segmental access replacement:** Insertion of a short (3 to 5 cm long) interposition PTFE AV graft or venous segment.  
  
**Anesthesia management and concerns for AV Fistula Revision:  
**Anesthesia management and concerns are the same as AV fistula but differ in that coexisting pulmonary hypertension (PHT) is likely; thus, increased vigilance for PHT is necessary.  
  
**Warning:  
**_Undiagnosed pulmonary hypertension (Group 5.4) is common among patients with end-stage renal disease receiving long-term hemodialysis via a surgical arteriovenous fistula.  
Vasopressin or Norepinephrine must be readily available for the management of hypotension refractory to phenylephrine._**Phenylephrine infusion in mild PHT.  
**Titration of phenylephrine is commonly used to successfully treat anesthesia-induced hypotension in patients with mild PHT._When hypotension becomes refractory to phenylephrine, it is most likely PH-induced and must be treated promptly.  
Phenylephrine is discontinued immediately, and vasopressin, 0.5 to 1 unit, is given while the hypotension source is investigated and corrected.  
Note: This is not the case if the patient has a low EF and a history of heart failure._  
**The “hemodynamic spiral” of PHT induced HYPOtension (PHT Crisis):****An increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) decreases cardiac output:**An abrupt increase in PVR initiates a catastrophic hemodynamic chain of events:  
↑ PVR will ↑ RV afterload ↓ RV stroke volume → (less blood travels to LV) ↓ LV stroke volume and CO, SVR, ↓ coronary blood flow to RV→ RV failure and cardiac arrest.  
_In this intraoperative scenario, continued administration of phenylephrine will continue to increase PVR and may become irreversible and possibly fatal.  
Vasopressin is the drug of choice._  
**PHT-induced hypotension treated with phenylephrine may be fatal!  
**Patients who are experiencing PHT-induced hypotension will NOT typically respond to phenylephrine.  
The hypotension will worsen due to the increased PVR caused by the alpha-adrenergic action of phenylephrine.  
If not appropriately managed, this will become irreversible, causing myocardial ischemia, RV failure, and death.  
  
**_The drug of choice in this scenario is vasopressin._**Vasopressin increases SVR and may decrease PVR.Vasopressin is an endogenous hormone that exerts its pressor effect by affecting V1 receptors and, unlike phenylephrine, does not stimulate alpha-adrenergic receptors located in the systemic and pulmonary vessels.  
Vasopressin increases SVR and produces nitric oxide (NO)-mediated selective pulmonary vasodilation (Evora et al. 1993).  
There is evidence that vasopressin has little to no effect on PVR.  
Vasopressin bolus of 0.5-1 unit, given as needed, is effective in treating PHT-induced hypotension.  
  
**Norepinephrine (Levophed) is the inotrope/pressor of choice for hypotension with pulmonary hypertension.**  
Some forms of pulmonary hypertension are associated with ventricular failure and require an inotrope  
In this case, a low dose of Levophed is the optimal choice.  
  
**A premixed syringe of norepinephrine (4mcg/mL) for patients with known PHT.**  
Administer 4 mcg of levophed (1 cc) immediately as needed.  
Mix a 4 mL vial of norepinephrine (1 mg/mL) in a 250 cc bag of normal saline (4,000 mcg in 250 mLs) = 16 mcg/mL.  
**Dilute it :** Mix 1 cc of the 16 mcg/mL of levophed with 4 mLs of normal saline in a 5 mL syringe = 4 mcg/mL  
Administer 4 mcg of levophed (1 cc) immediately as needed.  
  
**Note:** A revision may be more extensive than the original AV fistula procedure.**Anesthetic:** Usually, a MAC or general with an LMA.  
\- Hopefully, the surgeon will administer an effective local injection.  
\- A low dose propofol infusion tends to offer a low maintenance case.  
\- 10-20 mg of ketamine prior to local injection and, as needed, enhances sedation.  
\- Use a Salter NC with ETCO2 sampling when performing a MAC.  
**\- Supraclavicular nerve block:** The block of choice, but not as common as general anesthesia.  
**Note:** An Interscalene block will not cover the ulnar portion of the forearm.  
  
**Important considerations:  
Time of the last dialysis** because hypovolemia and hyperkalemia may be present.  
**\- Most recent K+,** because hyperkalemia worsens with sedation-induced HYPOventilation.  
\- As a result of sedation, the patient may HYPOventilate while maintaining adequate oxygenation (without a change in SaO2).  
\- The body compensates for the respiratory acidosis (even if it’s minor) by exchanging H\+ ions for K+ at the cellular level, and now their K+ has increased even more.  
\- This is when you may see cardiac side effects of hyperkalemia on your monitor (PVCs, V-Tach, etc.).  
  
**Acceptable K+ levels for this procedure** vary with the situation and medical judgment.  
K+ levels of 5.2-5.9 mEq/l are not uncommon, but it is rare to proceed if K+ is greater than 6.0 mEq/l.  
Recent ECG should be reviewed for a history of PVC and careful intraoperative monitoring for dysrhythmia.  
The greater the degree of hyperkalemia, the less sedative is necessary or desirable.  
**Other Concerns:**  
**Concerns** include comorbidities such as peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, COPD, pulmonary hypertension, morbid obesity, sleep-disordered breathing, and renal disease (candidates for the procedure have end-stage renal disease).  
**Diagnosis:** ESRD  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**Position:** Supine with surgical arm positioned on an arm/hand table and the bed rotated for surgical access.  
  
**Antibiotics:** Usually cefazolin (Ancef®)  
**EBL:** 10-50 ml  
**IV Access:** 20g is acceptable.  
Venous access may be quite difficult.  
A catheter as small as 22g may be necessary in extreme cases.  
Veins in the feet may be acceptable if no other site is available.  
Obviously, the surgical arm is avoided.  
  
**Possible Complications:  
**PHT Crisis ad cardiac arrestBleeding  
Infection  
Non-maturation: When the vein never enlarges or becomes thick-walled enough to be used for dialysis.  
Fistula or graft aneurysm.  
AV fistula or graft stenosis or clot.

**Mechanism of action:  
Calcium:** Immediate resting membrane stabilization  
It does not promote the intracellular shift or elimination of K+.  
**Na Bicarbonate:** Shifts potassium intracellularly.  
**Notes:** Calcium chloride is more irritating to the veins than calcium gluconate.
