### TPA (CathloActivase, Retavase and TNKase) - Tissue Plasminogen Activator

**Class:** Thrombolytic**Antidote:** Amicar (aminocaproic acid)  
**Monitor:** plasma fibrinogen may be useful.  
  
**Anesthesia providers should not be administering TPA.**  
TPA is naturally found on endothelial cells (within the lining of blood vessels).  
**Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator)** is a serine protease found on endothelial cells involved in the breakdown of blood clots (fibrinolysis). tPA enzyme catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin.  
tPA is now generically synthesized via recombinant biotechnology techniques and used medically as clot busters in the early time period of strokes, MIs and pulmonary embolisms. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) has now become the standard of care for treatment of acute ischemic stroke for several years.  
**  
Indications:  
**To treat embolic or thrombotic stroke.  
  
**Administer tPA ASAP  
**The time from the onset of initial stroke symptoms to the administration on tPA and thrombolysis is crucial and probably the most important determinate for success.  
Due to the extremely small timeframe in which a patient is eligible to receive rtPA, it is estimated that only 3% to 5% of stroke sufferers reach a hospital in time to be considered for this treatment.  
Today, protocol guidelines require its use intravenously within the first three hours of the event, after which its detriments may outweigh its benefits.  
  
**Goal of Clot Busting**  
The goal for breaking down clots is for early reperfusion therapy is to reduce or prevent tissue infarction distal to the clot and thereby minimizing mortality.  
  
**Mechanism of Action  
**Plasmin breaks down fibrin = fibrin degradation products (FDPs).  
tPA binds to fibrin on the surface of the clot.  
Activates fibrin-bound plasminogen.  
Plasmin is cleaved from the plasminogen associated with the fibrin.  
Fibrin molecules are broken apart by the plasmin and the clot dissolves (degregation of clots).  
  
_Although tPA is relatively selective for clot-bound plasminogen, it still activates circulating plasminogen thereby releasing plasmin, which can lead to the breakdown of circulating fibrinogen and cause an unwanted systemic fibrinolytic state._  
  
**Indications:**  
For the reduction of mortality associated with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).  
Treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after the onset of AMI symptom.  
  
**Onset:** Coronary thrombolysis occurs in 30 min; reaches peak response at 60 min.  
**Metabolism:** Rapidly cleared by the liver and poorly understood.  
**Peak plasma time:** 20-40 min  
Thus > 50% of t-PA is cleared from plasma within 5 minutes after discontinuance of an IV infusion and approximately 80% is cleared within 10 minutes.  
  
It has a short half-life and therefore is usually administered as an intravenous bolus followed by an infusion.  
  
**Half-life: around 5 minutes** (free, unbound form)  
**Terminal half-life:** 72 minutes  
**Excretion:** Urine  
**Metabolites:** Degradation products (constituent amino acids of alteplase).

_FDA package labelling all recommend against the use of tPA when there is a known coagulopathy, the patient is taking warfarin and the INR is greater than 1.7, the PTT is elevated, or platelets are less than 100,000._

| Minimal Time between  
last dose and  
neuraxial procedure | Can it be given with  
epidural catheter in place? | Restart after  
neuraxial procedure and/or  
catheter insertion | Restart after  
catheter removal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avoid  
Insufficient clear data  
  
Consider assessing clotting  
studies and fibrinogen  
at 48 hours after last dose.  
  
Other source: 48 hours | No | Insufficient data.  
Not until fibrinogen level has recovered.  
  
Other source:  
10 days without catheter | Insufficient data.  
Not until fibrinogen  
level has recovered.  
  
Other source:  
No sooner than 10  
days after initial dose |

**Restart medication after procedure:** No recommendations, avoid with an indwelling catheter.  
**Remove catheter after last administration:** No recommendations, check Fibrinogen level, one of the last clotting factors to recover.
