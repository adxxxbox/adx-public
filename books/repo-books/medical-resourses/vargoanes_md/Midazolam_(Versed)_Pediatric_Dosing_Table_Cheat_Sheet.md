| IV dose for 6 months to 5 years |
| --- |
| **Initial dose:** 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg IV  
If necessary, repeat after 2 - 5 minutes titrating to desires levels  
**Max single dose:** 2 mg IV  
**Repeated dosing to reach desired effect:** 0.2 mg/kg up to max of 6 mg total (rare)  
Prolonged sedation and the risk of hypoventilation may be associated with the higher doses. |

**Extra Notes:  
Midazolam in Preterm Infants and Neonates:**  
\- Preterm infants and neonates lack or have deficient levels of CYP3A4 enzymes but appear to reach adult levels at around one year of age.  
\- May result in profound and/or prolonged respiratory effects.  
\- In reality, midazolam is rarely used in preterm or neonates.  
  
**Rapid injection of midazolam should be avoided in the neonatal population.**  
\- The rapid IV administration of midazolam (less than 2 minutes) has been associated with severe hypotension in neonates, particularly when the patient has also received fentanyl.  
\- Severe hypotension has been observed in neonates receiving a continuous infusion of midazolam who then receive a rapid intravenous injection of fentanyl.  
\- Seizures have been reported in several neonates following rapid intravenous administration.  
  
**Pediatric patients > 1-year-old may require larger doses.**  
\- As a group, pediatric patients generally require higher dosages of midazolam (mg/kg) than adults.  
\- Ages one to six years may require higher dosages (mg/kg) than older pediatric patients and may require closer monitoring.  
  
**Obese pediatric patients:**  
\- The dose should be calculated based on ideal body weight.  
\- Midazolam is given in conjunction with opioids or other sedatives, the potential for respiratory depression, airway obstruction, or hypoventilation is increased.  
\- The healthcare practitioner who uses this medication in pediatric patients should be aware of and follow accepted professional guidelines for pediatric sedation appropriate to their situation.  
  
**Adverse effects reported in pediatric patients:  
**Desaturation  
Apnea  
Hypotension  
Paradoxical reactions  
Hiccough  
Seizure-like activity  
Nystagmus  
  
**Pediatric patients > 1-year-old may require larger doses.**  
\- As a group, pediatric patients generally require higher dosages of midazolam (mg/kg) than adults.  
\- Younger (ages one to six years) may require higher dosages (mg/kg) than older pediatric patients and may require closer monitoring.
