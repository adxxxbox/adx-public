### Postdural Puncture Headache (PDPH)

**Also known as:  
**PDPHPost spinal Headache  
Post lumbar headache  
  
\- Post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) is a common complication in neuraxial anesthesia and analgesia techniques.  
\- It may result from an accidental dural tear with an epidural puncture needle or following spinal anesthesia, mainly when using a large gauge or sharp point needles.  
\- It occurs in approximately 1% of obstetric patients.  
\- An epidural blood patch (EBP) is the gold standard for its treatment.  
  
**The International Headache Society included the following criteria in its definition of PDPH:  
**\- Develops within 5 days following the dural puncture  
\- Neck stiffness and/or  
\- Subjective hearing symptoms  
\- Signs of diplopia  
\- Nausea  
\- Resolve spontaneously in the next two weeks or after placing an autologous epidural blood patch (EBP).  
  
Keep in mind that 5% of obstetric patients may express atypical characteristics, and hence the postural sign may be absent 8  
  
**Characteristics of the PDPH include:  
**\- Bilateral headache  
\- Frontal headache  
\- Retro-orbital and/or occipital with radiation to the neck.  
\- It may be described as throbbing or constant and associated with nausea and photophobia.  
\- It typically worsens within 20 seconds of standing or sitting and resolves within 20 seconds of recumbency.  
  
**Differential diagnosis of PDPH in an obstetric patient:**  
Caffeine withdrawal  
Migraine  
Meningitis  
Sinus related  
Preeclampsia  
Pneumocephalus  
Intracranial pathology (intracranial subdural hematoma and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome).  
**Note:** There is an increased risk for an intracranial subdural hematoma after a PDPH with an incidence of 1.5 per 100 000 deliveries.  
  
**PDPH onset:** Generally, 12-72 hours after the procedure.  
Occasionally it may be immediate.  
  
**PDPH duration:** Usually remits spontaneously within two weeks or after the sealing of the leak with an EPB  
  
**Risk factors for PDPH:  
Women:** Have a two to three-times increased risk for PDPH  
**Pregnancy (labor):** Increased CSF pressure during labor is also thought to lead to a more significant CSF leak and a higher risk of PDPH.  
**History of headaches**  
**Age:** 18 to 50 years of age having the highest risk.  
**The volume of CSF removed:** High volumes of CSF removal (ie, 20 to 30 mL) with lumbar punctures have been associated with an increased risk of immediate PDPH.  
**Needle gauge:** the smaller the gauge, the less risk  
  
**Facts and statistics of PDHD:  
Unintentional dural puncture (UDP):**  
UDP occurs in < 1 to as high as 6 percent of epidural placements.  
11 to 33 percent of UDPs go unrecognized until the patient presents with PDPH.  
  
**Incidence of PDPH after UDP with an epidural needle for labor analgesia:** 81 and 88%  
  
**Incidence of PDPH after spinal anesthesia:** < 3 percent but may occur in up to 9%  
depending on the type and size of the needle used.  
**Post Lumbar puncture:** In 11 % of cases when a standard, traumatic needle is used  
**Two major pathophysiological mechanisms in PDPH have implications in terms of the therapeutic options:  
  
1)** The CSF leak through the defect causes traction of the central nervous system structures, including the sensitive cranial nerves, and results in pain.  
  
**2)** Intracranial hypotension produces compensatory cerebral vasodilatation to maintain the intracranial volume and causes vascular-type headaches.  
  
**Simplified explanation from a dural puncture:**  
\- The development of a headache is due to leakage of CSF through the “hole” in the dura.  
\- This Leakage causes an overall decrease in CSF volume within the cranial vault.  
\- Though the brain itself has no pain receptors, there are pain receptors in the meninges that line and cover the brain.  
\- Because the brain is attached to the skull via the meninges (specifically the dura mater) when the volume of CSF decreases, it causes the brain to sink within the cranial vault, thus causing tension to develop at the points of attachment with the skull this stimulates the pain receptors in the dura mater, leading to a headache.  
\- When the patient assumes an upright position, there is traction on the dura, tentorium, and blood vessels, resulting in pain.  
\- Traction placed upon the sixth cranial nerve may result in diplopia and tinnitus.  
  
**Diagnosis of PDPH:  
**\- It is usually based on the clinical presentation, using the above diagnostic criteria.  
\- Consider a neurology consult if the patient develops any focal neurological signs or a persistent headache despite the general treatment measures.  
\- The differential diagnosis, particularly in the obstetric population, includes tension headache or migraine and even more severe conditions such as preeclampsia, meningitis, sagittal sinus thrombosis, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.**Dural punctures may occur after the following:**  
\- Spinal  
\- Epidural “wet tap” (most common)  
\- Epidural catheter threaded or migrated into the subarachnoid space.  
\- Epidural needle tip scratched the dura- enough to cause a subsequent leak.  
\- Lumbar puncture  
  
**Pneumocephalus headache vs PDPH:  
**\- Pneumocephalus should be considered in the presence of an ACUTE thunderclap headache in the setting of epidural and spinal anesthesia, especially when the patient is sitting up.\- Pneumocephalus in the obstetrical setting usually results from accidental injection of air into the intrathecal space from the “loss of resistance” technique, which is used to identify the epidural space during spinal or combined spinal/epidural anesthesia.  
\- The onset is quicker if the patient is sitting up, allowing the air to rise quickly into the ventricles.  
\- Early diagnosis for pneumocephalus is helpful as treatment with supplemental oxygen may hasten recovery.  
**Differential diagnosis is essential to rule out meningitis.  
**\- The two key differentiating signs and symptoms include the postural component of the headache and lack of a fever.  
\- Additional tests include a normal white blood cell count and a negative cerebral spinal fluid tap.  
\- A spinal tap would be necessary only when the diagnosis is unclear.  
\- Most postural puncture headaches can be diagnosed based on the postural component, lack of fever, and normal white blood cell count.  
**  
Pencil point spinal vs cutting needle:  
**\- _If possible, use a PENCIL point needle for spinal anesthetics._  **  
  
Pencil point needles:**  
\- Have a closed tip shaped like a pencil, with a hole on the side of the needle near the tip.  
\- Pencil point needles are considered atraumatic because they cause less trauma to the dura.  
\- They are designed to minimize CSF leaks after a dura puncture and reduce the chance of PDPH (Whitacre and Sprotte).  
\- In reality, they cause more trauma than cutting needles.  
\- However, this trauma is advantageous since an inflammatory reaction results in localized edema, which reduces the size of the defect and minimizes the amount of CSF that leaks out.  
  
**Cutting needles (Quinke):  
\-** Standard needles (traumatic) that have sharp cutting tips with a hole at the end of the needle.  
\- These needles have a greater chance of creating a PDPH, thus considered “traumatic.”  
\- These needles also have an increased incidence of PDPH when inserted in a manner that transects the dura fibers in a transverse fashion.  
  
\- If using a cutting needle, place the bevel of the needle so that it is longitudinal to the fibers.  
\- In the past, fibers were thought to be longitudinal.  
\- Recently, it has been found that fibers are random in nature.  
\- However, when a cutting needle is orientated longitudinally, there is a decrease in PDPH.  
\- This is because tension is placed on the fibers in a longitudinal manner.  
\- Tension will then pull the fibers “open” and allow additional CSF to “leak” out.  
  
**Clinical information needles and PDPH (NYSORA):**  
**Dural puncture with an epidural needle:** 52.1% risk for PDPH.  
**Dural puncture with a spinal needle:** 1.5% - 11.2 % depending on the needle size and type.  
**Smaller needle diameter:** Decreases the incidence of PDHD  
  
**Use the smallest needle possible.**    
22-gauge needle: 40% risk  
29-gauge needle: < 2%  
The larger the needle, the higher the incidence of PDPH.  
  
**Needle orientation:**  
\- PDPH is more than twice as likely if a cutting spinal or epidural needle is inserted with the bevel perpendicular (bevel up) rather than parallel to the long axis of the spine.  
\- Pencil point needles have no bevels; thus, needle orientation is irrelevant.  
**  
Conservative treatments for PDPH:  
**Bedrest-supine  
Hydration 1-liter bolus and euvolemic  
NSAIDs  
Caffeine  
Antiemetics (5HT-3 antagonists)Cosyntropin  
Fioricet (a combination of acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine)  
Abdominal binder  
Steroids  
  
**Invasive treatments for PDPH:****Autologous epidural blood patch (EBP) -** Gold standard**Sphenopalatine ganglion block** \- less common  
**Greater occipital nerve block** \- less common
