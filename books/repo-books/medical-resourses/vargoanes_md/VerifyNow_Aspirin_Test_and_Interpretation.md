### VerifyNow Aspirin Test and Interpretation

Patients with inadequate platelet inhibition by aspirin, referred to as aspirin resistance, may have an increased risk of suffering cardiovascular events.  
  
Identification of aspirin resistance patients is important.  
  
VerifyNow Aspirin uses arachidonic acid (AA) in its cartridge as its platelet activator. This, allows platelet activation and fibrinogen binding via the inhibited thromboxane A2 pathway.  
  
**Aspirin Reaction Units (ARU)**  
Test results are reported in Aspirin Reaction Units (ARU) which indicate the amount of thromboxane A2-mediated activation of GP IIb/IIIa receptors involved in platelet aggregation.  
  
**Expected values of** **VerifyNow Aspirin**  
Range of 350-700 ARU

| Results | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| 350-549 ARU | Therapeutic range for platelet function (aspirin is effective) |
| ≤ 549 ARU | Evidence of platelet inhibition due to aspirin |
| 550-700 ARU | No evidence of aspirin-induced platelet inhibition aspirin resistance or effects of aspirin have dissipated |

**_Substances known to interfere with the VerifyNow aspirin assay include:_**  
**GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors:** dipyridamole, clopidogrel  
**NSAIDs:** Ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, indomethacin and piroxica.
