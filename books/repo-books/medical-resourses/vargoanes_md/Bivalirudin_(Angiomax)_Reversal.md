Bivalirudin (Angiomax) Reversal    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Bivalirudin (Angiomax) reversal

_Currently, there is a lack of specific antidotes for the growing number of new (novel) anticoagulants that are slowly replacing warfarin and heparin. For this reason, there is NO universal standard of care for the treatment of the anticoagulated bleeding patient when there is no specific antidote._

**Consult cardiology for ALL patients with coronary stents.**

**Quick Notes  
**Direct thrombin inhibitor with a very SHORT half-life.  
**T1/2:** 25 minutes  
**Clearance:** severe renal dysfunction (≤ 29 mL/min) = 57 minutes.  
Clearance is reduced approximately 20% in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment and by 80% in dialysis-dependent patients.  
After stopping infusion, its anticoagulant effects reverse rapidly, with coagulation times approaching baseline within 1 to 2 hours.  
  
**Dialyzable:** yes-partial, 25 % may be removed.  
  
**Specific antidote:** None  
  
**Lab Monitoring  
Thrombin time (TT)** is the most reliable.  
**aPTT:** commonly used.  
**Ecarin clotting time:** yes  
  
**Initial Treatment:  
**Discontinue.**  
  
Urgent (Not Bleeding):  
**Discontinue.  
Draw labs.  
  
**Optional documented treatments  
Desmopressin.  
**Desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg IV administered over 15 minutes.  
  
**Tranexamic Acid:** Not enough evidence, but can be considered.  
  
**Life-Threatening bleed**  
**FEIBA** (Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypassing Activity concentrate) doses ranging from 8-25 units/kg **tranexamic acid** can be considered.  
**Consider FFP** & **cryoprecipitate  
rFVIIa** (activated recombinant factor seven).  
  
In a few documented cardiothoracic surgery cases at UCDMC, low dose rFVIIa (1-2 mg) was able to drop ACT’s and slow bleeding within the surgical field.
