Baclofen Pump Insertion   

**Baclofen Pump Insertion**

_**Edited by: Brian Del Grosso, MS, CRNA**_  
  
**General Review:  
**Baclofen (Gablofen) is a muscle relaxant and GABA receptor agonist with actions in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.  
  
**Indications:**  
To treat moderate to severe spasticity in most of the body (arms and legs, and sometimes the trunk), which cannot be successfully treated with oral medications and Botox.

**Muscle Spasticity from:**  
Cerebral palsy  
Multiple sclerosis  
Stroke  
Brain injury  
Spinal cord injury from trauma

A fraction of the Baclofen PO dose can now be continuously infused intrathecally via pump with better results. All of these patients have already been successfully prescreened at their doctor’s office weeks prior to the surgical insertion.

**Anesthesia**  
From an anesthesia standpoint, these are pretty basic cases. After the patient is intubated, the patient is placed laterally and muscle relaxation is not required. You just have to be careful positioning since some of these patient’s have contractures.  
  
**Surgical**  
This case is a basic procedure for the surgeons.  
Neurosurgeons or orthopedic surgeons implant the majority of baclofen pumps.  

Using a C-arm, an intrathecal catheter is inserted percutaneously (lateral to the spinous process) through a Tuohy and then threaded into the upper lumbar or lower thoracic region. The catheter tip is advanced even more to prevent migration from the intrathecal space. T9–L1 appears to be a common level used by most surgeons. The intrathecal catheter is then secured.

The free end of the catheter is then tunneled to the location where the pump will be placed. The usual placement is the lower abdominal wall in a suprafascial pocket no more than 1 inch from the surface of the skin for ease of refilling.

Pump refills are done percutaneously in the outpatient setting. The pump is interrogated and programmed by a pump representative at the bedside.

**Age Range:**  
Usually 4 years and above **Preoperative Considerations:**  
Children with cerebral palsy (CP) and brain injury may be cognitively impaired which can create anxiety on both the parents and the child.  
A compete H & P needs to be done.

**  
Reminders you need to focus on:**  
Does the child have GERD?  
Nutritional state-poor nutrition leads to poor immunity.  
Allergy latex? (Latex allergies are common)  
Epilepsy (can lead to induced CYP450) causing reduced effectiveness of versed.

There may also be a decreased effectiveness with non-depolarizing  
relaxants.

**Pre-op meds to consider:**  
Versed  
Antacids  
Antiemetics  
Robinul- to help reduce reflux and secretions

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT

**Induction:** These patients for the most part will not have peripheral IV access. Additionally, these tend to be the more difficult patients to obtain access leading to long mask inhalation times. Keep patients spontaneously breathing (if appropriate keep on 70/30 N2O/O2 mixture along with Sevoflurane). These patients easily obstruct, so if needed use an oral pharyngeal airway.  
**Regional:** N/A

**Muscle Relaxation:** Initial paralysis to optimize laryngoscopy will help, however, most surgeons do not require it.  
**Position:** usually lateral.

**Duration:** 1-2hrs  
**IV Access:** 1 IV (appropriate for age/weight for Peds)  
**Nitrous:** OK to use  
**Hydration:** Follow standard 4:2:1 rule. Consider albumin for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg (to start with, most institutions will give as much as needed to maintain hemodynamics). Remember these patients can be nutritionally depleted, causing decreased volume status.

**Hydration: 4:2:1(below is just a common reference)  
**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin - more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**EBL:** minimal, do EBV calculations prior to the case. Discuss with the surgeon if he or she intends to have any difficulty.

**Emergence:** Patients are extubated.  
Have the patients slightly sitting up, suction both the oral pharyngeal area and the ETT prior to extubation.

**Intraoperative Considerations:**

These cases are generally pretty basic with a minimal blood loss. Things to consider in these cases are to make sure the patient is adequately hydrated through crystalloid (4:2:1 rule) and if still needed to consider Albumin. To optimize extubation keep narcotic on the lower end (1-2mcq/kg of Fentanyl) as well as the muscle relaxants (always fully reverse these patients).

**Possible Post Operative Complications (10%)**  
Infection  
Mechanical malfunction with pump  
Mechanical problems with the catheter  
CSF leak  
Fistula formation  
Catheter Migration  
Breakdown of skin over the pump  
Under dose- if the catheter leaks, tears, kinks, or become disconnected from the  
pump, resulting in underdose or no baclofen infusion at all.

**Symptoms of under dose: (** often early signs of baclofen withdrawal)  
Increase or return in spasticity  
Itching  
Low BP  
Lightheadedness  
Tingling sensation.

Patients must inform medical personal before any medical or diagnostic procedure such as MRI or diathermy.

**More Notes**  
The pump will sound an alarm when the pump needs to be filled with baclofen.  
  
Pump refills are performed percutaneously in the outpatient setting. The pump is interrogated and programmed with a small computer that communicates with the pump transcutaneously via radiofrequency by a trained rep.

**ITB Therapy  
**Baclofen has long been given orally to reduce tone following oral administration.  
Unfortunately, oral administered baclofen does not cross the blood-brain barrier easily, so relatively high doses must be administered to achieve a high enough cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) concentration to provide the reduction in tone needed. Because of the high oral doses, many of these patients experience the unwanted side effects of drowsiness.

**Advantage of ITB:** Produces a superior clinical effect at a dose several hundred times lower than the oral dosing without the side effects. Because the baclofen is administered directly into the spinal fluid, the dose needed for tone reduction is reduced to a small fraction of the oral dose

**Drug Related Side Effects of ITB**  
Loose muscles  
Sleepiness  
Upset stomach  
Vomiting  
Headaches  
Dizziness

**The signs and symptoms of Baclofen overdose:**  
Drowsiness  
Lightheadedness  
Dizziness  
Respiratory depression  
Hypothermia  
Seizures  
Loss of consciousness  
Coma.
