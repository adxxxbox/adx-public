Vulvectomy - Radical     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Vulvectomy - Radical

Surgery to remove the entire vulva.  The clitoris and the lymph nodes in one or both groin regions may also be removed.  
A low transverse incision is made over the pubic symphysis bone. Sentinel lymph node biopsies are sent to pathology.  
The tumor is also sent to confirm the margins are clear. If metastasis is found, a full, deep pelvic lymph node dissection is done. The vaginal walls and pelvic floor is reconstructed. Tissue flaps may also be done. A lot depends on the pathology results.

**Pre-op:** Check to see if the patient had a bowel prep; they may be volume depleted.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT

**Epidural:** Sometimes for post op pain; rarely done.

**Duration:**  1-3 hours.

**EBL:** Depends on pathology. That area is very vascular, so some blood loss is expected.

**Position:** Lithotomy.

**BP:** Go for a mild hypotension (with 20% of their base BP) to limit bleeding.

**Foley Catheter:** Yes

**Possible Complications**  
Bleeding  
Wound disruption with or without infection.  
Lymphatic fistula and lower extremity edema.  
Difficulties with micturition.  
Vaginal prolapse
