### Fast Track Cardiac Anesthesia (FTCA)

In the 1970s and 1980s, CABGs were most commonly done using very high doses of opioids and benzodiazepine supplementation. Earlier extubation and early discharge of a low risk patient to reduce costs has since become a priority.  
  
Many have found that with the greater reliance on inhalation agents and less on IV anesthesia, patients are extubated sooner. This observation led to the development of FTCA.  
  
**What is FTCA?**  
FTCA is indicated for low to medium risk CABG patients. FTCA is a perioperative process involving rapid progress from preoperative preparation through surgery and discharge from the hospital within 4-5 days. This involves early extubation, early ambulation, early diet, early chest tube and monitoring line removal, transfer from cardiac surgical recovery room. The process extends from admission to discharge.  
  
The anesthesia providers’ role is to titrate short-acting anesthetic drugs to achieve an early extubation within 1-6 hours of arrival in the cardiac surgical recovery room.  
  
Some facilities are quite aggressive and use remifentanil drips. Anesthesia used to give Formerly, large doses of fentanyl were used, as much as 40-60 ml (2.5–3 mg). This is no longer the case: blood pressure is now regulated with shorter acting agents such as nitroglycerine and phenylephrine, inhalation agent, short acting beta-blockers and lower doses of short-acting opioids.  
  
Opioids delay weaning in recovery. Using a dexmedetomidine (Precedex) infusion with lower opioid doses, the postoperative care team can achieve a smooth, early extubation.  
  
The operating room and ICU are the most expensive locations in the hospital. Fast-track cardiac anesthesia moves patient through these areas quickly and results in considerable cost savings.
