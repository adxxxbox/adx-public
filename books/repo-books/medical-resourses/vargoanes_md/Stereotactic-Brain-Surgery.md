### Stereotactic Brain Surgery (Brain Lab)

Is a real time 3-D minimally invasive technique that aids the surgeon to reach the precise location within the brain that is to be treated.

It works like GPS system in your car. The surgeon uses a wand or a pointer to see exactly where he/she is in the brain or on the skull, as depicted on a CT or MRI. It facilitates location and removal of the tumor.  
   
Frameless stereotaxy is the most popular. These systems, such as the Stealth and BrainLab, rely on the application of small markers, which are stuck to the patient’s head before the brain scan is performed.  
Anatomical landmarks such as the nose, eyes and ears may be used instead of markers.  
More recently, surface tracing techniques have done away with the need for markers and anatomical landmarks in some situations.

Frameless stereotaxy is slightly less accurate than the frame-based systems, however, its numerous advantages have meant that the vast majority of contemporary neurosurgeons performing brain surgery use it.

**_Don’t touch the patient’s head or the face after the surgeon sets up the brain lab!_**  
It will throw off the coordinates. Use the patient’s hand or foot for peripheral nerve monitoring.
