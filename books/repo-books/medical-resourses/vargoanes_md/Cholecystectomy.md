Cholecystectomy Open Peds   

### Cholecystectomy Open Peds

  
_Edited by: Brian Del Grosso MS CRNA_

**General Review:**  
With the increased use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the traditional open approach has become a rarity. The open approach is reserved for gallbladders that are expected to be difficult to remove due to inflammation, previous operations and adhesions, or other medical problems. The open approach is usually performed through a right subcostal or midline incision. Upward traction is applied to the liver or gallbladder, while downward traction on the duodenum exposed the region of the cystic duct and artery and common duct. Depending on the local conditions and the surgeon’s preference, the gallbladder may be removed from the top down, excising the gallbladder from the liver bed and isolating the cystic duct and artery as the final state of the operation. The cystic duct and artery may be isolated and divided first, and the gallbladder removed retrograde from the gallbladder bed as the final step of the procedure. Because the anatomy of the biliary tree is quite variable, there are numerous ways surgeons can remove the gallbladder. In either approach once the cystic duct and the cystic artery are identified, they clipped with tiny titanium clips and cut. The Gallbladder is then dissected away from the liver bed and removed.

**Indications:**  
Acute Cholecystitis  
Symptomatic Cholelithiasis  
Biliary Dyskinesia  
Gallbladder Trauma  
History of Liver Transplant  
Failed laparoscopic attempt  
Previous multiple abdominal surgeries  
  

**Preoperative Considerations:**  
Patient will need an OG tube and foley catheter in order to decompress stomach and bladder for optimal view. The bed should be reversed in case the surgeon decides to do an IOC. The newer operating beds do not require the bed to be reversed. They have Foot and Head sliding “Modes” to adapt to X-ray and C-arm requirements.  
  
**Warm up room regardless of age** (consider a lower or under body warming device).  
  

**EBL:** Minimal blood loss procedure (consider a larger bore PIV or an extra one just in case). Follow routine preoperative evaluation with additional evaluation of respiratory and cardiac function. Premedication is well tolerated (PO or IV versed). If the patient is actively nauseated, consider metoclopramide (0.1mg/kg) and ranitidine (0.8mg/kg). Given the increased risk of aspiration consider a cuffed ETT.

**Labs:** Most patients usually have a general chem and CBC lab work done from admissions. If not consider a CBC and other pertinent labs related to H&P.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT

**Induction:** Patients are a high risk of aspiration and if possible do an RSI. Most patients will have an IV, however, if not let patient breath down inhalation agent gradually with Nitrous and Inhalation agent (sevoflurane for induction) with keeping positive pressure ventilation under 15 PSI to avoid abdominal distention and increased risk of aspiration. Always have suction readily available.

**Inhalation Agents** : Avoid Nitrous Oxide to prevent bowel distention. Can use any agent, however, Sevoflurane and Isoflurane have been used the most.

**Muscle Relaxation:** Initial muscle relaxation is required in order to gain access to the abdomen. Depending on how fast the surgeon is, may only want to give initial dose to prevent delayed return of train of four. However, most surgeons want no spontaneous breathing so may have to decrease ETCO2 by increasing respirations or Tv to avoid this. If you are running into decreased blood pressure and increased spontaneous respirations, consider paralysis.

**Positioning** : Supine with arms out or tucked (this usually depends on the patient’s size, too small and the arms out could cause brachial plexus injury).

**Duration:** 30mins to 2hrs

**IV Access:** Try to obtain one good IV (22 gauge and above), some patients come in a dehydrated state and have very small peripheral IV access. As mentioned above, consider either two small IVs or one larger one incase more crystalloid or colloids are required.

**Age Range:** Infant to adult

**EBL:** Minimal, have a CBC available to know range you're starting with.  
**Blood Bolus dose:** 10-20cc/kg if needed.  
**Hydration:** Most patients are already on a maintenance iv therapy (usually D5W with 0.25NS and 20MEQ K) however, consider hooking up LR and following 4-2-1 rule for replacement therapy. Procedure usually does not require colloid therapy such as Albumin. However, treat low BP with volume.  
**(below is just a common reference)**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**Foley:** yes, bladder may be emptied for optimal view

**Duration:** 30mins to 2hrs

**Age Range:** infant to adult  
**EBL:** Minimal, have a CBC available to know range you're starting with.  
**Blood Bolus dose:** 10-20cc/kg if needed.

**Emergence:** Most surgeons will give local anesthetic around incisional site upon closing. Consider suctioning out stomach with OG tube and removing (some surgeons like the OGT to be replaced with an NGT so check with surgeon), foley is usually removed at end as well. Even though patients have their stomachs emptied, they are still a risk of aspiration, consider extubating in semi sitting position and awake.  
  
**Consider post operative pain medicine**  
Morphine (0.5-0.15mg/kg)  
Dilaudid (.02mg/kg), and/or Ketorlac (0.5mg/kg).  
Ofirmev: (>2 years: 15mg/kg), **Not FDA approved for < 2 years, but many still administer at 15mg/kg.**

**  
Intraoperative Considerations:  
**Patients may be dehydrated from fever, vomiting, and decreased oral intake; assess hemodynamic status by evaluating BP, HR, and urine output. Consider aggressive intravenous repleatment (4-2-1 rule). Sudden drop in blood pressure could also indicate trauma to an abdominal artery (calculate EBV prior to surgery). Most patients should also have a type and cross or type and screen prior to surgery.

**Post Operative Considerations:**  
Pain is usually greater in open versus laparoscopic approach. Pain may cause impairment of respiratory function (decreased FRC, hypoventilation, atelectasis). If feel patient has adequate pain medicine onboard and patient still presents with tachypnea, hyperpnea, and acute respiratory alkalosis, patient may be presenting as early signs of sepsis. Consider Chest Xray and labs. Surgeons usually infiltrate local anesthetic around the incision site, other post operative pain therapy can include acetaminophen, NSAIDS, and opioids. Most children go home in a day or so, however, it has been shown to be facility and surgeon dependent. Patients are kept NPO until bowl sounds return so will need maintenance fluids. Nausea and vomiting are always a risk, consider an antiemtic.

**Complications  
**Bleeding  
Perforation of the common bile duct with resultant bile leakage.  
Sub-hepatic abscess.  
Retained bile duct stones (consider this if patient still acting in pain despite all other options ruled out).
