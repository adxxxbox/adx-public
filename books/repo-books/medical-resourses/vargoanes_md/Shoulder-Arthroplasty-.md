Shoulder Arthroplasty or Total TSA     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Shoulder Arthroplasty or Total TSA

The primary goal of TSA is pain relief, with a secondary benefit of restoring motion, strength, and function. Most of these patients are suffering from end stage of various forms of arthritis or degenerative joint disease of the shoulder joint. The surgery involves replacing the humeral and the glenoid socket. Partial shoulder replacement or hemi-replacements may also be indicated with certain severe shoulder fractures of the humeral head. This technique requires the replacement of that component only.  
**Anesthesia:** The same as a rotator cuff repair.  
**General/ETT** with combined regional Interscalene Block. Supraclavicular block is possible but they sometimes don’t cover the proximal upper arm.

The Interscalene Block is done pre-operatively for post op pain management. If the patient can’t lift their arm just prior to surgery, you have a pretty good idea you will not need much narcotics during the case. Some surgeons request relaxation.    
**LMA instead of ETT:** Sometimes I have seen and also used an LMA for shoulders. Some CRNAs prefer to use them for shoulders.  But to warn you, your entire case can be miserable if you acquire ventilation issues once the patient is prepped and draped.  Airway access is very limited when the patient is sitting up and draped.  

**Positioning:** Beach chair or lateral decubitus. Lateral is rare. Bed rotated 45 degrees. Tape the ETT securely since your access to the airway will soon be limited.  
Keep the MAP within 20 percent of the baseline.  
Your biggest two concerns for this position are VAE and CVA.  
Have your Neosynephrine drip ready to infuse when you sit the patient up.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
**Neosynephrine Drip:** Yes, you must avoid hypotension. The BP naturally drops when you sit the patient up.  
IV and BP cuff are both on the non-operative arm. Try to avoid the antecubital site.    
**Duration:** 1.5-3 hours  
**EBL:**  50-100 mLs.  
**BP:** Avoid Hypotension. NOTE: BP at the head level could be around 25% below the cuff pressure on your monitor. Arterial pressure is reduced 0.77mmHg for every cm gradient above the heart. The vertical distance between the heart and head can be 22-90cm depending on the patient’s height. So there can be a relative difference in perfusion pressure between the brain and level of the heart. You still need to keep the MAP within the 20% of the baseline for this reason.  
  
   
**Possible Complications:** Infection  
Hypotension and stroke.  
Axillary nerve damage.  
Musculocutaneous nerve damage.  
Brachial Plexus nerve damage, which is position dependent.
