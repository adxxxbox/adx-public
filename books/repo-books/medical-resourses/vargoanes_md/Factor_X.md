### Factor X (Stuart-Prower-Factor; Stuart Factor or Prothrombinase)

Factor X is where the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways join to form the “common pathway.”  
Any drug that inhibits the common pathway will affect both PT and aPTT.

Activates factor II (prothrombin) to factor IIa and with the help of factor V (cofactor), it forms prothrombinase complex.

Prothrombinase catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin (Factor II), which is inactive, to active thrombin (Factor IIa).  
Vitamin K dependent.  
  
**Pathway:** It is both intrinsic and extrinsic (common pathway).  
**Half-life:** 40–45 hours.  
**Activated by:** Factors VIIa, VIIIa and IXa.  
**Factor Xa is inactivated by:** protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI).  
The affinity for factor Xa is increased 1,000-fold by the presence of protein Z, while it does not require protein Z for inactivation of factor XI.  
Defects in protein Z lead to increased factor Xa activity and a propensity for thrombosis.  
  
**Pathway:** It is both intrinsic and extrinsic. It is the first member of the _final common pathway_ or _thrombin pathway_  
  
Its deficiency may cause bleeding diathesis and hemorrhages. Patients commonly suffer from epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeds and hemarthrosis.  
_The gene for factor XI is located on the distal end on the long arm of fourth_ _chromosome (4q35)._
