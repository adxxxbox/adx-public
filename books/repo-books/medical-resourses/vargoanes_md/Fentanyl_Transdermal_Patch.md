### Fentanyl Transdermal Patch

**Referred to as:** DURAGESICÒ (Fentanyl transdermal system)**FDA approval:** 1968**For pharmacokinetics and other information on fentanyl, refer to:**  
_“Fentanyl (Sublimaze)”  
“Fentanyl (Sublimaze) Pharmacokinetics”_  
  
\- The fentanyl transdermal patch is a potent time-released patch usually reserved for chronic pain cancer patients.  
\- It is usually only prescribed by physicians who specialize in pain management.  
  
**Indications:** For pain management in opioid-tolerant patients, severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.  
\- They are used in the management and treatment of chronic pain and cancer pain.  
\- Duragesic is not indicated as an as-needed (PRN) analgesic.  
  
**Contraindications:  
**\- Opioid non-tolerant patients  
\- Acute or intermittent pain, postoperative pain, mild pain  
\- Significant respiratory depression  
\- Acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or absence of resuscitative equipment.  
\- Known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.  
  
**Limited use:**  
\- Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse of opioids, even at recommended doses, Duragesic is reserved for patients for whom all alternative treatment options are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain.  
  
**Skin absorption:  
**\- The fentanyl will be absorbed first through the topmost layer of the epidermis (stratum corneum) until further reaching the blood vessels to enter the systemic circulation and exert effects on the target receptors.  
  
**The skin serves as a secondary reservoir:**  
\- After about 24 hours, significant amounts of fentanyl transfer into the epidermis, which will act as a reservoir for fentanyl; only after the epidermis has absorbed enough drug will it enter the systemic circulation.  
\- This action provides a sustained level of fentanyl to avoid inconsistent pain control.  
\- This secondary reservoir phenomenon allows for the continual absorption of fentanyl and continues to exert effects on target receptors until the reservoir amount descends below the threshold.  
  
**Dosages:** 12, 25, 37.5, 50, 75 to 100 mcg/hour  
Peak plasma fentanyl concentrations in about 18 hours.  
**Duration:** 3 days (changed every three days)  
**Antidote:** Naloxone (Narcan)  
  
**Patch removal:  
**\- The elimination half-life after patch removal is 13 to 22 hours due to the slow release of fentanyl from the skin depot until metabolism.  
  
**Pediatric use:**  
\- It is not uncommon to see children with painful cancers with a low-dose Duragesic patch. 12 mcg/hour is a common dose.  
  
**Perioperative concerns:  
**\- Do not touch or remove the patient’s patch at any time unless ordered by the patient’s pain management physician.  
\- Wash your hands immediately if you think you may have been in contact with the underside of the patch.  
  
**Avoid hyperthermia or direct contact with a warming blanket or other external heat sources.**  
\- Exposure of the Duragesic application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources, such as a Bair Hugger, heating pads or electric blankets, heat or tanning lamps, sunbathing, hot baths, saunas, hot tubs, and heated water beds may increase fentanyl absorption and has resulted in a fatal overdose of fentanyl.  
  
**Warning for a newly applied patch or recently increased dosage:  
**The high-risk period for overdose is the first 24 to 72 hours of your treatment and any time the dose is increased.  
  
**The transdermal route bypasses the first-pass metabolism of fentanyl by the liver.  
Bypassing the liver** increases the bioavailability to 90%, making it possible to use lower doses of the drug, thus reducing the incidence of adverse effects.  
  
Accidental exposure to DURAGESIC, especially in children, can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl.  
  
**Other concerns below are in detail in the _“Fentanyl (Sublimaze)" file.  
_**Concomitant administration with the below are concerns or contraindications:  
Tranquilizers  
Neuroleptic drugs  
SSRIs  
**CYP3A4 inhibitors** (macrolide antibiotics or azole-antifungal agents)  
Post cessation of CYP3A4 inducers (i.e., carbamazepine, phenytoin)  
Protease inhibitors (HIV agents)  
Barbiturates  
Other opioids  
Benzodiazepines  
General anesthetics  
Pregnancy  
Nitrous oxide  
Severe hypotension  
Obstructive airway diseases  
Respiratory failure or depression  
Pulmonary hypertension (PHT)  
Maternal use during labor and delivery  
Breastfeeding:  
\- Patients with increased ICP, brain tumors, head injury  
\- Impaired consciousness: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression.  
\- Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with a physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and the patient may be weaned off the patch.  
  
**Pregnancy:**  
Prolonged use of DURAGESIC during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated.  
  
**Common adverse drug reactions:**  
Nausea (incidence of 10 to 90%)  
Vomiting (incidence of 10 to 90%)  
Constipation - Manageable with stool softeners and antiemetics
