**Example  
**Before we start, I need to tell you about the possible risks of an epidural.  
  
These risks are uncommon but I still need to mention them:  
  
**There is a risk of:**  
Bleeding  
Infection  
Back Pain  
Failed Block  
Nerve Damage  
Bleeding in the back referred to as hematoma  
Breathing and heart problems  
  
There is also a 1-2% chance of getting something called a postdural puncture headache. This is NOT a dangerous headache but it a bad headache and is treatable. If you do end up getting this headache, you would usually not get it until 1-2 days from now.
