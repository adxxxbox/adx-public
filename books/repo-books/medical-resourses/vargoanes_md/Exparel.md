**Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block doses (not FDA approved for TAP blocks)**  
Some CRNAs mix Exparel (20mL) with 40mL of normal saline and inject 30 ml bilaterally.  
  
The recommended dose of Exparel is based on the surgical site and the volume required to cover the area.  
  
Today, Exparel is used for many more surgical procedures than listed above. Doses vary between procedures and among providers.  
  
**Other uses**  
TAP Blocks after C-sections and with other abdominal surgeries.  
Infiltration of abdominal incisions.  
Plastic cases – abdominoplasty.  
Thoracotomies  
Orthopedics – total joints.  
  
However, many anesthesia providers still avoid using Exparel for nerve blocks pending FDA approval for additional indications.  
  
Exparel is bupivacaine encapsulated in lipids, and as the lipids are metabolized by the body, the bupivacaine is released at the site slowly over 92 hours.  
  
Exparel utilizes the DepoFoam drug delivery system consisting of an aqueous suspension of multi-vesicular liposomes containing bupivacaine in a honeycomb-like structure that allows for a more gradual release.  
  
**Indications and Usage  
**For single-dose infiltration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia.  
  
**Orthopedic surgeons using Exparel has been decreasing the requirement for epidurals and nerve blocks for postoperative analgesia.**  
It is becoming popular among orthopedic surgeons for joint replacements. This new trend has been decreasing the number of orthopedic blocks performed by anesthesia providers in some facilities, despite the conflicting orthopedic literature that Exparel has not outperformed non-liposomal bupivacaine.  
  
**TAP blocks as a substitute for intrathecal opioids**  
Literature has surfaced stating there is a higher patient satisfaction and lower pain scores with TAP Blocks vs. intrathecal opioids. This evidence may result in the use of TAP blocks in preference to intrathecal opioids.  
  
**Orthopedic literature**  
There are also presently conflicting studies in orthopedic journals on whether Exparel is more beneficial than non-liposomal (unencapsulated) bupivacaine. When orthopedic surgeons inject Exparel toward the end of the case, the patient may still experience immediate post-operative pain until the drug takes effect.  
  
_Caution: (According to Literature)_  
Non-bupivacaine-based local anesthetics, including lidocaine, may cause the rapid release of the bupivacaine from the liposomal slow release vehicle when administered TOGETHER LOCALLY.  
  
Exparel may be administered 20 minutes or more after the administration of lidocaine. Other formulations of bupivacaine should not be administered within 96 hours following administration of Exparel.  
  
**Dosing in Special Populations**  
Exparel has not been studied in patients younger than 18 years of age, pregnant patients or patients who are nursing.  
  
**Possible side effects:** Nausea, vomiting, constipation, pyrexia, dizziness and headache  
  
**CONTRAINDICATIONS**  
Exparel is contraindicated in obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia. While Exparel has not been tested with this technique, the use of bupivacaine HCl with this technique has resulted in fetal bradycardia and death.  
  
**No Studies under Age 18**  
Exparel has not been studied in patients younger than 18 years of age, pregnant patients or patients who are nursing.  
  
**Hepatic Disease**  
Because amide-type local anesthetics such as bupivacaine are metabolized by the liver, Exparel should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic disease. Patients with severe hepatic disease cannot metabolize local anesthetics normally and are at a greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations.  
  
**Monitoring of the Patient**  
Monitoring of cardiovascular and neurological status as well as vital signs should be performed during and after injection of Exparel as with other local anesthetic products.  
  
Exparel should be injected slowly into soft tissues of the surgical site with frequent aspiration to check for blood and minimize the risk of intravascular injection.  
  
Exparel is intended for single-dose infiltration only.  
  
Exparel should be administered with a 25 gauge or larger bore needle.  
  
Do not administer Exparel if the product is discolored.  
  
Do not administer Exparel if it is suspected that the vial has been frozen or exposed to high temperature (greater than 40°C or 104°F) for an extended period.  
  
Exparel can be administered undiluted or diluted up to 0.89 mg/mL (i.e. 1:14 dilution by volume) with normal (0.9%) sterile saline for injection or lactated Ringer’s solution.  
  
Vials of Exparel should be inverted multiple times to re-suspend the particles immediately prior to withdrawal from the vial.  
  
Diluted suspensions of Exparel should be used within 4 hours of preparation in a syringe.  
  
If Bupivacaine HCl is injected immediately before Exparel, this may impact the pharmacokinetic and/or physicochemical properties of the drugs if the milligram dose of bupivacaine HCl solution exceeds 50% of the Exparel dose.  
  
The toxic effects of these drugs are additive and their administration should be used with caution, including monitoring for neurologic and cardiovascular effects.  
  
**Absorption  
**The rate of systemic absorption of bupivacaine is dependent upon the total dose of drug administered, the route of administration, and the vascularity of the administration site.  
  
**Distribution**  
After bupivacaine has been released from Exparel and is absorbed systemically, bupivacaine distribution is expected to be the same as for any bupivacaine HCl solution formulation.  
  
Local anesthetics, including bupivacaine, are distributed to some extent to all body tissues, with high concentrations found in highly perfused organs such as the liver, lungs, heart and brain.  
  
**Pregnancy  
**Local anesthetics including bupivacaine appear to cross the placenta by passive diffusion.  
**The rate and degree of diffusion is governed by:  
**The degree of plasma protein binding.  
The degree of ionization.  
The degree of lipid solubility.  
  
Fetal/maternal ratios of local anesthetics appear to be inversely related to the degree of plasma protein binding because only the free, unbound drug is available for placental transfer.  
  
Bupivacaine with its high protein binding capacity (95%), has a low fetal/maternal ratio (0.2 to 0.4%). The extent of placental transfer is also determined by the degree of ionization and lipid solubility of the drug. Lipid soluble, non-ionized drugs such as bupivacaine readily enter the fetal blood from the maternal circulation.  
  
**Metabolism**  
Amide-type local anesthetics such as bupivacaine are metabolized primarily in the liver via conjugation with glucuronic acid. pipecolylxylidine (PPX) is the major metabolite of bupivacaine; approximately 5% of bupivacaine is converted to PPX. Elimination of drug depends largely upon the availability of plasma protein binding sites in the circulation to carry it to the liver where it is metabolized.  
  
Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of hepatic disease. Patients with hepatic disease, especially those with severe hepatic disease, may be more susceptible to the potential toxicities of the amide-type local anesthetics.  
  
**Excretion**  
After bupivacaine has been released from Exparel and is absorbed systemically, bupivacaine excretion is expected to be the same as for other bupivacaine formulations.  
  
The kidney is the main excretory organ for most local anesthetics and their metabolites. Only 6% of bupivacaine is excreted unchanged in the urine.  
  
Urinary excretion is affected by urinary perfusion and factors affecting urinary pH. Acidifying the urine hastens the renal elimination of local anesthetics. Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of renal disease, factors affecting urinary pH, and renal blood flow.  
  
**Specific Populations:  
Hepatic Impairment  
**The effects of decreased hepatic function on bupivacaine pharmacokinetics following administration of Exparel were studied in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Consistent with the hepatic clearance of bupivacaine, mean plasma concentrations were higher in patients with moderate hepatic impairment than in the healthy control volunteers with approximately 1.5- and 1.6-fold increases in the mean values for C-max and the area under the curve (AUC), respectively.  
  
Because amide-type local anesthetics such as bupivacaine are metabolized by the liver, these drugs should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic disease. Patients with severe hepatic disease cannot metabolize local anesthetics normally and are at a greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations.  
  
**Renal Impairment  
**Bupivacaine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Care should be taken in dose selection of Exparel.  
  
**Age  
**Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics such as bupivacaine can be significantly altered by the age of the patient.  
  
In clinical studies, differences in various pharmacokinetic parameters have been observed between elderly and younger patients.  
  
Bupivacaine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection of Exparel.
