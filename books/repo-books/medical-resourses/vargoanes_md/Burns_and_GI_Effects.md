### Burn and GI Effects

Stress Ulcers  
Impaired GI barrier to bacteria  
Endotoxemia

In the early acute phase (Burn Shock), we approach these patients as having a full stomach – RSI.

Inflammation and capillary leak following a severe burn can contribute to abdominal compartment syndrome often resulting in decreased pulmonary compliance, oliguria, and/or hemodynamic instability.

Nasogastric ventilation tubes and / or feeding tubes may support gastric decompression.

Balanced anesthetics and perioperative pain control are preferred to reduce opioid induced GI dysmotility.

Early enteral nutrition is important for GI protection and wound healing because of increased calorie expenditure and needs during hypermetabolic phases.

Frequent trips to the operating for surgical debridement’s etc. will interrupt feedings and reduce caloric intake. Adequate calories are detrimental to healing and recovery.
