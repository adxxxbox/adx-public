### SVT Ablation

This type of ablation is to the right atrium (like an A-flutter ablation) and does usually not require an A-line or General Anesthesia/ETT.

**Procedure:**

The EP cardiologist advances a sheath percutaneously through the groin (femoral vein) and up to the right atrium for mapping.

The EP cardiologist usually does not have to cross the atrial septum.

After the right atrial mapping is completed, a single ablation line is created between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid valve (cavo-tricuspid isthmus ablation) to interrupt the SVT circuit.

Intubation with the need for esophageal temperature monitoring is NOT needed.

**Note:** If the patient is in a normal rhythm during the procedure, an attempt is made to reproduce the SVT by pacing the heart through the catheters.

The less sedation, the better.

Occasionally, an **Isuprel drip** is required to rev up the heart to reproduce the SVT.

**Isuprel Hcl (4 mcg/mL)**

| Dose | Drip Rate |
| --- | --- |
| 1 mcg/min | 15 cc/hr |
| 2 mcg/min | 30cc/hr |
| 3 mcg/min | 45cc/hr |
| 4 mcg/min | 60cc/hr |
| 5 mcg/min | 75cc/hr |
| 6 mcg/min | 90cc/hr |

Once the SVT is reproduced, the specific type of SVT can be diagnosed using the catheters in the heart.

Depending on the EP cardiologist, some of these procedures do not require anesthesia services unless there is a concern with the patient’s airway, obesity, or questionable cooperation.

**Note:**

SVT ablation is generally not painful, so it can be performed with only conscious sedation.

Patient satisfaction is higher; sicker patients do better when anesthesia services are involved.

**Anesthesia management:** MAC or General

Communicate with the EP cardiologist; some prefer light MAC, while others prefer general anesthesia.

**Light MAC:**

It is imperative to inform the patient preoperatively that they likely will be awake for part of the procedure.

Patient cooperation to not move around should be discussed.

Short-term sedation with sheath placement is recommended.

Back off or turn off the propofol while mapping.

Once the mapping is completed, you can re-sedate.

It is good to keep the patient sedated during sheath removal.

**General anesthesia:**

LMA or GETA

**Duration:** 1-3 hours

**Muscle Relaxant:** If you are intubating, relax the patient.

No contraindications exist from a surgical standpoint.

**EBL:** Hopefully minimal

**IV Access:** 18G.

Two IV sites are common because both arms will be tucked, and having a backup IV is convenient in case one IV infiltrates.

**IV Tubing Extension:** It helps when there is limited anesthesia space.

Tubing extension with a 3-way stopcock to administer medications without getting up next to the patient may be helpful.

The less radiation exposure, the better.

**A-line:** Not needed.

**Position:** Supine with arms tucked.

**Foley:** Sometimes

**Hydration:** Normovolemic

**Esophageal Temp Probe:** Not needed

**Neosynephrine Drip:** Have available

**Emergency Meds:** Yes, have emergency meds readily accessible like all EP procedures.

Ephedrine or Norepinephrine are your drugs of choice for a possible cardiac tamponade.

**Lead Apron:** Make sure you get one that fits because you will wear it for a long time.

**Pressor drips:** Not usually required for a MAC procedure.

**Possible Complications:** < 1% of patients.

Inadvertent puncture of the femoral artery

Hemorrhage

Femoral vein hematoma

Still, they can include the need for a permanent pacemaker in a very small percentage of patients (<1 in 400).

Cardiac Tamponade –from puncturing the heart

**Cardiac Tamponade:** If you see the pulse oximetry waveform dampen with a drop in BP, immediately inform the cardiologist and repeat a blood pressure cycle.

The cardiologist wants to be informed immediately, even if it is a false alarm.

A portable ultrasound or an ICE (Intra Cardiac Echo) catheter is usually near the patient to quickly assess for cardiac tamponade.

**More Notes:**

Various measurements of the electrical system are performed.

An ablation catheter can deliver small radiofrequency lesions (electrocautery burns) on the order of 4-5mm in diameter.

These radiofrequency lesions have no long-term adverse consequences.

Depending on the type of SVT, these radiofrequency lesions are delivered in various heart locations.

**Some Types of SVTs**

**Atrioventricular re-entry tachycardias (AVRT)** use the ventricle as part of the circuit.

These tachycardias are dependent on the presence of an accessory atrioventricular (AV) pathway.

If the patient’s accessory pathway is not visible, it is called a "concealed" (or hidden) accessory pathway.

Under the right conditions, an electrical impulse can travel down the normal electrical connection and back up the accessory pathway.

This mechanism accounts for approximately 30% of SVTs.

Ablation will eliminate the accessory pathway.

**Atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia (AVNRT)**

Where the re-entry circuit is within the AV node, and the ventricle plays no part in maintaining the arrhythmia.

**Atrial tachycardia** is due to an abnormal electrical impulse originating from a spot (focus) in the upper chambers (atria) other than the normal pacemaker center (SA node).

Ablation will eliminate this abnormal focus.

Regular supraventricular tachycardias (SVT) can be cured by catheter ablation with high success rates (95-99%) and low complication rates (< 1%).

**WPW:** These patients are born with an extra accessory pathway between the heart’s upper and lower chambers.

**The first method of treatment for SVT is medication.**

Doctors may recommend daily doses of calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and/or digoxin or antiarrhythmic medicine.

If these meds fail, then the next step is catheter ablation.

SVT ablation has a cure rate of 95-99% with low complication rates (<1%).
