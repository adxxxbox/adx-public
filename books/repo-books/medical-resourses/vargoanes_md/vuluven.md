# Voluven

**Voluven (Hydroxyethyl Starch)**  

Black Box Warning by the FDA concerning Hespan and Voluven. HES solutions increase a patient’s risk of rapid loss of kidney function.

We no longer administer Hespan or Voluven. Albumin is our colloid of choice.

Below is the old literature.

It’s a Tetrastarch in NS. #1 synthetic Colloid in the world. Has been used by other countries for the past 13 years. A synthetic colloid for use in plasma volume replacement.  

**Advantage over Hespan:** You can give well over a liter without the increased risk of surgical bleeding. Hespan is limited to 2 bags. Molecular size is 1/4th the size of Hespan and a little bit smaller than Albumin. Voluven is a smaller molecule is the reason that it has a nice safety profile relative to bleeding and renal issues. It is broken down easily into even smaller molecules and is easily eliminated, instead of lingering around after its clinical effectiveness is gone as the larger MW molecules do. So, the size of the molecule is the reason it is safe.  

**Volvens C2C6 Ratio:** makes it more of a challenge for the amylase to get metabolize the molecule which allows it 6-8 hours of volume expansion.  

**Dose:** Literature states to first slowly infuse 10-20mLs and observe for possible anaphylactic reaction. Up to 50 mL of Voluven/kg/day x 10 days. This dose is equivalent to 3,500 mL of Voluven for a 70 kg patient within a 24 hour period. Limited to 10 consecutive days.

**Peds:** The safety and efficacy of Voluven® have not been established in the age group of 2 to 12 years.

**Indications:** For the Treatment of hypovolemia, prophylaxis of hypovolemia. Mean molecular weight (130 kDa). Has a greater and more rapid increase in skeletal muscle tissue oxygenation with acute normovolemic hemodilution as compared to Hespan.

**Warnings and Precautions:** Anaphylactoid reactions (mild influenza-like symptoms, bradycardia, tachycardia, bronchospasm, noncardiac pulmonary edema).  

**CONTRAINDICATIONS** Known hypersensitivity to hydroxyethyl starch. Pulmonary edema and CHF. Renal failure with oliguria or anuria not related to hypovolemia. Patients receiving dialysis. Severe hypernatremia or severe hyperchloremia. Intracranial bleeding.  

**Warning and precautions:** Anaphylactoid and hypersensitivity reactions. Avoid fluid overload; adjust dosage in patients with cardiac or renal dysfunction. In severe dehydration, a crystalloid solution should be given first. Observe caution in patients with severe liver disease or bleeding disorders. Monitor kidney function, fluid balance and serum electrolytes. Elevated serum amylase values may occur and interfere with the diagnosis of pancreatitis. High dosages may cause dilution of blood components Hospira has said it is working to correct the safety problems and will report its progress during its earnings conference call in February. The FDA has asked the Lake Forest-based medical products manufacturer to change its marketing of Voluven, a plasma substitute designed to increase patients' blood volume after surgery or trauma. In an apparent bid to boost sales, Hospira has improperly claimed that Voluven also can be used during major abdominal surgery, to prime cardiac pumps and to treat swelling, according to an FDA letter to a Hospira executive. Voluven already has a spotty reputation. Over the past decade, German anesthesiologist and blood researcher Joachim Boldt has published dozens of studies suggesting that hydroxyethyl starches such as Voluven were as effective as alternatives without the negative side effects like profuse bleeding. That research fell into disrepute amid 2010 allegations that Dr. Boldt's data was fraudulent. Voluven has "already got a stain on it because you can't really tell how it works," said Erin Fox, manager of the Drug Information Service at the University of Utah Hospitals and Clinics. Though widely used in Europe, the drug has had less success in the United States because of the scandal.
