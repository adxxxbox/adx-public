### Prostaglandin Analogue

**Prostaglandin Analogue (PG12)  
**Prostacyclin activates adenylate cyclase, raising the cyclic AMP level in platelets.  
This indirectly decreases ADH levels. ADH is a platelet activator that increases the binding between the GIIb/IIIa receptors on the surface of platelets and fibrinogen for platelet aggregation.
