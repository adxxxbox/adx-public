### Organ Donor Protocol and Info

Patient is usually already in a unit on strict protocols from a transplant team. They will inform you what drips to run and maintain.

They will also inform what BP to maintain. Keep warm because of a nonfunctional Hypothalamus. Warm room, blankets and warm IV fluids. Use Pavulon, Vecuronium or Atracrium. Don't have to use gas-many of us still do. Before the case starts, make sure you have a fast flowing IV.

Have Mannitol, Hespan, Heparin, Lasix and dopamine available

100% FIO2, may need peep Keep SBP > 100 or 90 May need vigorous volume replacement-check with Transplant RN.

UOP > 2cc/kg/hr Lasix or Mannitol if requested REMEMBER: Once cross clamped-you are done unless they are taking the lungs!

Prior to cross clamping the aorta, MD may want you to give Heparin -around 30K units. Ask about Heparin if the surgeon does not mention it. Record cross clamp time. (heart and lungs are removed 1st) They will bronch the patient before removing the lungs. If taking the lungs, anesthesia still has to hang around.  
  
**Organ removal in order:**  
heart>lungs>pancreas>liver>kidneys Tissue will come out after anesthesia is done!

Don't do anything outside of guidelines from MD request or Transplant RN Coordinator.
