Sentinel Lymphadenectomy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Sentinel Lymphadenectomy

Excision of a single or small number of lymph nodes identified by staining or lymphoscintigraphy technology.  

**The nerves the surgeon avoids with Axillary Node Dissections**  
Long Thoracic Nerve  
Thoracodorsal Nerve  
Intercostobrachial Nerve

**Damage of the Long thoracic nerve (motor):** Can be seen specifically with radical mastectomies that involve removal of axillary lymph nodes. The damage leads to a winged scapula (scapula alata) from the paralysis of the serratus anterior muscle. This is most prominent when the arm is lifted forward or when the patient pushes the outstretched arm against a wall. However, even winging may not be evident until the trapezius stretches enough to reveal an injury several weeks later.

**Damage to the Thoracodorsal nerve (motor):** This injury results in a palsy of the latissimus dorsi muscle.

**Damage to the Intercostobrachial nerve (sensory):** This results in a numbness or pain in the lateral aspect of the axilla and the medial aspect of the upper arm.  
  
**Intercostabrachial Neuralgia aka post mastectomy pain syndrome or PMP):** pain in the axilla, medial upper arm and anterior chest wall.

**Lymphedema:**  
This complication occurs less frequently with the standard axillary dissections performed nowadays (level I and II). It is more frequently seen when an axillary dissection is combined with axillary radiation.
