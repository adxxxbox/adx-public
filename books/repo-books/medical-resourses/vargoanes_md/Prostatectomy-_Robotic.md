### Prostatectomy– Robotic

**Assisted Laparoscopic Radical**  
**Prostatectomy (Da Vinci)**  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT

**Duration:** 1-3 hours; depends on experience of the surgeon.

**Position:** Lithotomy, bed all the way down, maximum Trendelenburg after trocars are placed; both arms tucked. The patient is strapped tightly so they won’t slide down. Remind the circulator to lower the legs in lithotomy before you go to Trendelenburg.  
**EBL:** 50-100 mLs.

**IV Access:** 1-2  20 or 18G. If you just use 1 IV, make certain it runs well as soon as the arms are tucked. Correct any IV issue at this time.

**IV Fluid:** Check with the surgeon. We almost always keep the patient dry (<1liter) until the end of the case or urine will leak into the abdominal cavity while the bladder is separated from the urethra. Towards the end of the case when the urethra and bladder are being re-anastomosed (on the screen, you will see the Foley in place), you can open your fluids wide open. There are surgeons who prefer normal hydration because they can complete this procedure in 1 hour. 

**Neo Drip:** Usually make sure you connect your Neosynephrine tubing before the arms are tucked. Remember, these patients are hemodynamically dry.  

**OGT:** Consider it, especially if the patient has gastroparesis. I’ve seen bile drip over the patient’s faces during these cases while in Trendelenburg.  
**Indigo Carmine:** Yes, the surgeon will tell you when to give it. Usually at the end of the case while the surgeon does the cysto, or it might be needed during re-anastamosis.

**Face Protection:** Yes, a foam donut pillow or cradle placed over the face. Some of the robotic equipment is placed on the drapes over the patient’s face.  
**Eye protection:** Always. Usually goggles. There seems to be a higher incidence of cornea abrasions with robotic cases. Eye goggles are standard in most facilities. Patients complain of eye irritation from post op conjunctival swelling and tend to want to rub their eyes.  
 

**Conjunctival Swelling:** Yes, being in steep Trendelenburg for hours can cause this. It is common.  
**Ventilation Issues:** Yes, Change to Pressure Control Ventilation. Once the patient is in steep Trendelenburg, the abdominal contents will shift against the diaphragm, thereby decreasing FRC, compliance and lung volumes. It will immediately become difficult to volume ventilate due to the elevated peak pressures. This is especially exaggerated with patients with big bellies.  So it is probably easier to change over to pressure control ventilation.  
 

**Possible Complications:**   
Bleeding  
Corneal Abrasions  
Conjunctival Swelling-post op  
High peak pressures during the procedure  
Ureter perforation  
 

**Protect Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP)**   
MAP-ICP (or CVP) = CPP  
Normal CPP = 70-110mmHg  
In steep Trendelenburg, the CVP or ICP is drastically elevated. It becomes obvious here not to permit a low MAP.  
  
CPP < 50mmHg   = slowing of the EEG  
CPP 25-40mmHg = flat EEG  
CPP < 25 mmHg = irreversible brain damage  
  
**Advantages of Robotic Prostatectomy:**  
Quicker discharge and recovery  
Less blood loss  
Nerve Sparing, not causing impotency

  
**Disadvantage:** Cost to the patient
