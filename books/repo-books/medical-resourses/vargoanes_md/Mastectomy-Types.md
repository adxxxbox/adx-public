### Mastectomies Types

Mastectomy is the medical term for the surgical removal of one or both breasts.

**  
Partial Mastectomy**: This term is not commonly used anymore. It’s now usually called a “Lumpectomy.”

**Subcutaneous Mastectomy**: Excision of breast tissue with preservation of overlying skin, nipple, and areola so that the breast may be reconstructed. It is usually a prophylactic procedure.

Modified Radical Mastectomy: Total mastectomy with axial node dissection, but leaving the pectoral muscles intact.

Radical Mastectomy: Amputation of the breast with wide excision of the pectoral muscles and axillary lymph nodes. We don’t do as many of these as we once did, thanks to the success of chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and radiation.

In any mastectomy that involves an Axillary Node Dissection, do NOT relax the patient! The surgeon wants to see the muscles twitch so he knows to stay away from the nerves close to the axillary nodes. These are located per gentle stimulation. He does not want to damage these nerves, but wants to locate these nerves to ligate their respected artery and vein.
