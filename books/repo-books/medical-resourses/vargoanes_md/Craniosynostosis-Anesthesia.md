Craniosynostosis Anesthesia   

### Craniosynostosis Anesthesia

**_Edited by Jovanna Eisenbarth CRNA, Mason General Hospital in Shelton, WA_**

In this surgery, a neurosurgeon and a plastic surgeon work together to reshape the skull. The neurosurgeon removes the affected suture and the craniofacial plastic surgeon shapes the skull bones into a more normal shape. This releases the prematurely closed suture and to allows the rapidly growing brain to remodel the skull and face to a normal shape.

There are different types of Craniosynostosis repairs: Total Calvarial Reconstruction and basic Strip Craniectomy

**Total Calvarial Reconstruction:**  
This is a very long procedure, usually 3-5 hours, for the treatment of sagittal suture synostosis. This procedure has a considerable amount of blood loss that usually requires blood transfusions.

**Strip Craniectomy:**  
This is a shorter procedure with minimal blood loss, especially when done with endoscopic assistance.

One should be vigilant and aware of the potential for massive blood loss with either surgical method. The total reconstruction is more controlled presently. It was historically associated with massive blood loss.

Craniosynostosis can provide significant airway challenges including difficult mask and/or intubation.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
Make sure to thoroughly secure the ETT. This could be a long case involving head movement as needed by the surgeon. Consider a tegaderm over each side or wing of the tube tape to help secure and protect from moisture from blood, prep, saliva or irrigation.  
One option is to initially nasally intubate for ETT stability. However, changing the ETT to orally in the middle of the procedure may be required. Some surgeons may actually suture the ETT to the adjacent tissue. These methods may be overkill and ensuring a good stick of the tape with a mandible and maxilla anchor is often sufficient.  
  
**Eye Protection:  
**Eye lubricant should be utilized and tegaderm placed over eyes is often enough to protect from prep and fluids. Consider a hard eye shield to protect the eyes during the procedure. Depending on the patient position for the procedure, this could be crucial for eye protection.

**Age:** Usually around 1 year old  
**Duration:** 1-6 hours  
**IV Access:** 2 large bore IVs  
**Hydration: 4:2:1** **(below is just a common reference)**  
Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**A-Line:** Yes  
**Central Line:** Only if peripheral access is limited  
**Blood available in the room:** Yes, unless it is a small Strip Craniectomy endoscopic procedure with minimal blood loss expected.

**Intraoperative Labs:** Hct, ABGs and electrolytes for long procedures

**Positioning:** Varies with location of prematurely closed sutures and procedure  
**\-Prone:** Usually for calvarial reconstruction and sagittal craniosynostosis  
**\-Supine:** Fronto-orbital and midface advancements  
The bed is usually rotated 180 degrees. There will be minimal access to the airway once draped. Make sure all the cables, IVs and tubes are accessible and not tangled when or after the bed is rotated.

**EBL:** Variable  
Most of the blood loss is from the subgaleal tissues and the fresh ends of the cut bones. Sometimes it is difficult to accurately measure blood loss. This is due to much of the loss being collected under the drapes, absorbed by the drapes, on sponges, in suction tubing and reservoirs mixed with saline irrigation.

**Transfusion:** For a **Total Calvarial Reconstruction**, it is common to start transfusing blood around incision time to keep up with the ongoing losses. Communicate with the surgeon about this. Serial ABG’s can help monitor blood loss and replacement efficacy.

**Hypothermia risk:** Body heat is lost through the large exposed head. Core body temperature should be continuously monitored. Underbody warming blanket, heating the room and IV fluid warmers are helpful.

**VAE Risk:** Small asymptomatic VAE can be as high as 85%. Clinically significant VAE is 1-2%. Exposure of the osteal veins and head elevation to reduce venous congestion increases the risk for VAE. Watch closely for sudden changes in HR, heart rhythm, BP, ETCO2, transthoracic Doppler and TEE. If VAE is suspected, the head should be lowered and the wound flooded with saline and covered immediately. Efforts to aspirate air from the heart, even when a central venous catheter is in place, are unlikely to be useful.

**Possible Complications  
**\-Oculocardiac reflex is possible during surgical manipulation  
\-Considerable blood loss requiring massive transfusions  
\-DIC  
\-Venous air embolism  
\-Positional injury  
\-Hypothermia

**Post-op Extubation:** Often these children are stable enough to be extubated in the immediate post op period. Consider extubation in the OR rather than sending to the ICU to be extubated. Assess for airway swelling and edema related to the surgery and positioning.

**Surgical Procedure**  
The goal is to release the prematurely closed suture and to allow the rapidly growing brain to remodel the skull and face to a normal shape. Surgical incision is usually made over the top of the head, from just above one ear to just above the other ear. The cut is usually wavy. Location of incision depends on the specific problem. A flap of skin, tissue and muscle that covers the skull is incised and folded back for surgical exposure of the cranium.

**Strip craniectomy-** A strip of bone is removed where two sutures connect.

**Synostectomy -** Larger pieces of bones are removed. These bones may be changed or reshaped when they are removed and reattached. Some bones may be left in place shifted or repositioned.

Sometimes, the bones around the eyes are cut and reshaped.

More and more surgeons are releasing the prematurely closed suture to allow the rapidly growing brain to remodel the skull and face to a normal shape. The new shape is held together by plates and screws that expand as the skull grows. The plates and screws are made of a special material that breaks down and dissolves completely in one or two years.
