### Sigmoidoscopy or Flexible Sigmoidoscopy

The insertion of a sigmoidoscope or scope is used to look inside the rectum and lower colon, also called the sigmoid and descending colon.

A colonoscopy advances further up the large intestine until it reaches the cecum.  
  
**Anesthesia:** Same as a colonoscopy, but a shorter procedure in duration.  
It is less stimulation and will require less propofol.
