### Gastric Sleeve Resection

**(Sleeve Gastrectomy, Tube Gastrectomy or Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy)**  
A newer type of bariatric surgery in which 85% of the stomach is removed. The sides of the stomach are then joined by staples, leaving the stomach smaller and tubular in shape, but retaining the sphincter muscles at the top and the bottom of the stomach. It looks like a sleeve. Most are laparoscopic. This surgery is irreversible.  
Besides an elevated BMI, many of these patients also have DM type II and OSA.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT, RSI.  
Believe it or not, most of these patients are easy intubations. Glidescope at the ready.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Yes.

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes. Depends on the surgeon.

**Position:** Supine with reverse Trendelenburg. The patient is securely strapped and arms are out.  
**Ventilation:** When you combine a pneumoperitoneum which decreases respiratory compliance with obesity, you could expect elevated peak pressures. Despite being in reverse Trendelenburg to counter this, the patient may still require PCV mode and always add PEEP.       
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable. Start hydrating early in PACU due to the patient being dry from a bowel prep.

**EBL:** Minimal  
**Esophageal Temp Probe:** Yes, but never past the oral pharynx.

**OGT:** Yes; the stomach needs to be initially emptied.  
**Bowel Prep:** Yes; expect them to be dry.

**Neo Drip:** Usually, reverse Trendelenburg and being volume depleted is not good for blood pressure.  
**Emergence:** Elevate the HOB or reverse Trendelenburg. Many of these patients still desaturate due to a poor reserve. Large manual breaths (tidal volumes) with inspiratory holds (pulmonary recruitment) will increase the patient’s FRC. These will counter the desaturations during emergence.   

**Possible Complications**  
Dumping Syndrome-post op  
Hemorrhage  
Difficult airway  
Desaturations with emergence  
Leaks from staple lines which can lead to peritonitis or abscess.  
Infection  
Gastric outlet or bowel obstruction.

**Bougie:** Some surgeons prefer to use a 28-30F bougie to size the pouch at the proximal area of the stomach. You will be asked to place it down the esophagus. Make sure you lubricate it and don’t force it.

**Methylene Blue leak test:**  You may be asked to insert a large hollow gastric tube down and the surgeon will instruct you on how deep to insert it. You will be asked to pour some Methylene Blue (mixed with saline by the circulator in a bowl) through this tube to enable the surgeon to check for leaks. The tricky park is pulling it out without making a blue mess on your patient’s face. Sometimes these tubes have a balloon that inflates (like an endotube) and the surgeon will ask you to inflate it and pull back a little. They want to see resistance. This is to check the Hiatus for a hernia.

**More Notes:**  
Weight loss is slower for this procedure than for the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. These patients expect to lose 50 - 80% of excess body weight within 12 months after surgery.  
   
**Gastric Sleeve: A First Step for Some People**  
Although the number of stand-alone gastric sleeve procedures is increasing, many times this surgery is a **first step in a two-part process**.

For people who are either **extremely obese** or have **health problems** that make them ineligible for gastric bypass surgery, the gastric sleeve procedure is an option to help them start losing weight.

After a few years, most people lose enough weight to complete the **second step** of the process, typically with the duodenal switch procedure for further weight loss.
