### Pheochromocytoma and Phentolamine Mesylate

**Pharmacologic class:** Alpha-adrenergic blocker.  
  
**Action:** Competitive blockade of postsynaptic (alpha1) and presynaptic (alpha2) adrenergic receptors. It acts on both the arterial tree and venous beds, reducing total peripheral resistance and lowering venous return to the heart.  
  
**Indications:** To prevent or control hypertensive episodes before or during adrenalectomy.  
Also used for the prevention or treatment of dermal necrosis after norepinephrine extravasation.  
**  
Pheochromocytosis Doses:**  
Maximum effect usually occurs within 2 minutes of dosing.  
  
**Adult Doses:** 5mg IV 1 to 2 hours before surgery, then 5mg IV during surgery as indicated.  
  
**Children:** 1mg IV 1 to 2 hours before surgery, then 1mg IV during surgery as indicated.  
  
**Drip:**  
**Adults:** 0.5-1mg/min. During surgery a 5 mg dose can also be given and titrate the drip as needed. The literature tells us to record BP immediately after injection, at 30-second intervals for the first 3 minutes, and at 60-second intervals for the next 7 minutes.  
  
**Positive Response:** A drop in BP of more than 35 mmHg systolic and 25mmHg diastolic pressure. A typical positive response may be a drop of 60mmHg systolic and 25mmHg diastolic. Maximal depressor effect usually is evident within 2 minutes after injection. Return to pre-injection pressure commonly occurs within 15 to 30 minutes, but may return more rapidly.  
  
**IV Extravasation Treatment:**  
**Adults:** For treatment, inject 5 to 10mg in 10 ml of normal saline solution into extravasated area within 12 hours.  
  
**Off-label uses**  
Hypertensive crisis caused by MAO inhibitors. Rebound hypertension caused by withdrawal of clonidine, propranolol, or other antihypertensives. Erectile dysfunction (given with papaverine).  
  
**Contraindications**  
Hypersensitivity to drug, CAD, MI, or history of MI/Coronary insufficiency, Angina  
  
**Precautions**  
Use cautiously with patients receiving cardiac glycosides concurrently, and pregnant or breastfeeding patients.  
  
**Adverse reactions CNS:** Weakness, dizziness  
**CV:** Tachycardia, acute and prolonged hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, and arrhythmias.  
**EENT:** Nasal congestion  
**GI:** Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea  
**Skin:** Flushing  
  
**Interactions:  
Drug-drug:** _Ephedrine, epinephrine:_ Antagonism of these drugs' effects.**Drug-herbs:** _Ephedra (ma huang):_ Antagonism of vasoconstrictive effects.  
  
**Goal:** Don't allow SNS stimulation. Most of all these patients are already on an alpha- blocker and/or a beta-blocker and the patient's BP should be under control before surgery. Some patients may even be on drips rather than the PO versions.  
  
**Common Alpha Blockers:**  
_Phentolamine (Regitine):_ 1⁄2 life of 19 minutes.  
_Prazosin (Minipress):_ 1⁄2 life of 2-3 hours.  
_Phenoxybenzamine (Dibenzyline):_ 1⁄2 life of 24 hours.
