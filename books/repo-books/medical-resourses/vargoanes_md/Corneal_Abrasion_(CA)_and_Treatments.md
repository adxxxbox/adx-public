### Corneal Abrasion (CA) and Treatments

An ASA closed claims analysis showed that eye injury occurred in 3 percent of all claims in the database.  
Other data shows an incidence typically between 0.013% and 0.17% of non-ocular surgeries.  
  
Ocular injuries are reported to account for between three and 8% of anesthesia malpractice claims, with 35% stemming from perioperative corneal abrasions (Gild 1992, Jordan 2001).  
  
**Eye ointment**  
There are mixed reports in the literature regarding recommendation for use of gel, ointment, or eye drops to moisten eyes during anesthesia.  
  
**Risk Factors and causes of corneal abrasions  
Positioning:** Lateral or prone  
  
**Long surgery time:** eyes should be periodically checked to make sure that they are staying closed. One study concluded that corneal changes are evident after 100 minutes of anesthesia and eye erosions after two hours. Other studies have similarly demonstrated that these changes peak around two hours and are not seen in anesthetics with less than a one-hour duration.  
  
**Head and neck procedures:** Care should be taken to protect the patient with moisture vapor permeable **(MVP,** Tegaderm®) to seal and protect the eyes from cleaning solutions.  
  
**Special risk factors:**  
Surgery performed on **Monday**  
(Roth 1996, Cucchiara 1988, Moos 2006).  
  
**Advanced age**  
**Simple mask:** Application of a simple face mask post-extubation (face mask or strap)  
**Not taping the eyes** prior to direct laryngoscopy: Eyes should be closed and securely taped immediately after induction of anesthesia  
**Steep Trendelenburg:** Procedures involving steep Trendelenburg may cause scleral edema with post-op eye irritation leading to patients rubbing their eyes.  
After robotic prostatectomies, leaving safety goggles over the eyes until the patient is fully awake in the recovery room has shown to drastically decrease CA at one facility in SC.  
**Direct mechanical trauma:** including the oxygen facemask, laryngoscope, sterile drape, nasal cannula, and low-hanging identification badges.  
**Rubbing the eyes:** Patient attempts to rub the eyes with a pulse-oximeter finger or eye irritation from scleral edema.  
**Hypoxia:** The cornea is extremely sensitive to hypoxia (low arterial partial pressure of oxygen).  
Corneal hypoxia leads to edema and potential for loss of the epithelial layer, causing an abrasion.  
  
**Definitions and related facts**  
**Bell's phenomenon:** Involves the upward movement of the eye associated with eyelid closure with sleeping and is a protective mechanism. This is inhibited with general anesthesia and increases risks of CA.  
**Lagophthalmos:** Incomplete eyelid closure. Has been reported to occur in over half of patients under general anesthesia, increasing corneal exposure and surface drying. Make sure the eyes are completely closed when taping (Batra 1977).  
  
**General anesthesia reduces tear production  
**During general anesthesia, the reduction of tear production leads to corneal drying.  
Corneal drying in the presence of lagophthalmos can lead to dry patches and corneal abrasion.  
If corneal abrasion is suspected, the diagnosis can be made using flourescein and a blue light.  
Many anesthesia providers do not have access to flourescein and a blue light and treat the patient with eye drops.  
  
_Small corneal abrasions often do not need treatment and patients should be reassured these will usually heal within 24-72 hours._  
  
**Treatment of CA**  
Topical NSAIDS for analgesia (diclofenac or ketorolac drops).  
Some feel that topical anesthetics should never be used as they can hinder healing, mask worsening symptoms, and lead to keratitis.  
Lubricants  
Antibiotic eye drops: Controversial; may be used as a last resort.  
The incidence of infection following corneal abrasion is <1 percent.  
A prospective cohort study of prophylactic topical antibiotics (chloramphenicol) did demonstrate a decrease in ulcer formation when started within 18 hours of injury. Thus, antibiotic drops may be indicated to prevent ulcers.  
  
Patients remaining under the care of anesthesiology have been treated with artificial tears (REFRESH TEARS PLUS ® Eye Drops) instilled in the affected eye every 30 minutes for 2–3 hours until symptoms subsided.  
The eye is not patched.  
  
If the symptoms do not improve after 2–3 hours, then 0.5% erythromycin ophthalmic ointment may be applied to the affected eye every 6 hours until symptoms subside  
If the patient are allergic to erythromycin, they received an alternative treatment (ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, bacitracin, or ketorolac 0.5% drops).  
  
If symptoms do NOT improve by morning, obtain an ophthalmology consultation.
