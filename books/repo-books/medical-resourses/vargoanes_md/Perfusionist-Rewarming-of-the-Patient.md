### Perfusionist Rewarming of the Patient

Rewarming the patient’s core temp above 36C is the first step of weaning off CPB. The patient initially may not be rewarmed evenly throughout the body.  
  
If the rewarming is inadequate such that the patient’s surface temperature is colder than core temperature by 7C or greater, further heat loss could occur during wound closure. Shivering and an increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in the recovery period will increase MVO2.  
  
Core temperature should not be permitted to rise above 37C because it that could lead to tachycardia and may increase the risk of central nervous system dysfunction.
