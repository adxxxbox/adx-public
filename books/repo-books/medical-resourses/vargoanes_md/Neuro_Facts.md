In kids, the open sutures may compensate for increases in ICP, but significant increases will result in bulging fontanels

Normal ICP in neonate is 2-4mmHg

The Cushing response is absent at birth

At birth the spinal cord ends at the intervertebral space of L3, this is normal by the age of 8 years

The brain requires 120 grams of glucose a day; neonates actually have higher brain glycogen stores

The limits of autoregulation are not well established in kids

Vulnerable to cerebral damage due to hypoxia, hypercarbia, ischemia, seizures and hemorrhage

Cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation is impaired in premies-poor response to hypoxia and hypercarbia

CBF becomes more pressure dependent-prone to intra ventricular/intracranial hemorrhage.

Spinal cord extends up to L3 at birth

It reaches adult level L1 to L3 by age 8 at 1

Spinal taps below L3

Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) is immature at birth, and impermeable to electrolytes
