### Precautions for Airway Laser Cases (Excluding ETTs)

The FIO2 should be as low as possible (many patients tolerate an FIO2 of 21%).  
Avoid Nitrous oxide because it supports combustion.

The tracheal tube cuffs should be filled with saline dyed with methylene blue to dissipate heat and signal cuff rupture. A cuffed tube will minimize oxygen concentration in the pharynx. The addition of 2% lidocaine jelly (a 1:2 mixture with saline) into the proximal cuff can seal small laser-induced cuff leaks, potentially preventing combustion.

Laser intensity and duration should be limited as much as possible.

Saline-soaked pledgets (completely saturated) should be placed in the airway to limit risk of ignition.

A source of water (a 60-mL syringe) should be immediately available in case of fire.
