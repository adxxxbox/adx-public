Tachycardia-Unstable    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Tachycardia-Unstable

Tachycardia is a HR > 100bpm  
Tachycardia in anesthesia is common, especially after induction.  
  
**Tachycardia–Unstable refers to:**  
Hypotension  
Ischemic chest pain  
Altered mental status  
Shock

In anesthesia, it is usually **_hypotension_**.  
  
**Most Common Causes of Perioperative Sinus Tachycardia  
Severe hypovolemia- post induction:** The heart rate increases, to compensate a drop in BP from the peripheral vasodilation combined with a dry vascular bed. This is usually easily treated with small doses of neosynephrine and volume wide open, to replace the fluid deficit. Do not administer a beta-blocker at this time.  
  
**Light anesthesia**  
**Pain (surgical/ tourniquet/bladder)**  
**Hypotension:** will be the problem the vast majority of the time.

Most of the sinus tachycardia we deal with, is stable with a narrow complex.

When the HR > 150bpm, hemodynamic instability may start to occur which cardioversion may be indicated.

**Wide-complex and irregular**\- Treat as V-fib. Go to the “V-fib /V-tachy link.”

Call for anesthesia help and a code cart STAT

Ask the surgeon to stop or delay the procedure  
Increase oxygen to 100%  
Decrease inhalation agent

**For Cardioversion**  
Place cardioverter/defibrillator pads on the patient  
Administer a small dose of sedation if needed  
Turn defibrillator ON, set to defibrillator mode  
Push Synchronization button  
Look for a spike on the “R” wave indicating synchronization mode  
Adjust if needed until the “Synch” markers are seen the “R” wave

**Energy lever for Cardioversion**

Use Cardioversion Table below for the suggested energy level.

**Biphasic Cardioversion Energy Levels**

**Steps**

1.) Start with the lowest energy level  
2.) Select energy level  
3.) Press the charge button  
4.) Press and hold the charge button  
5.) After the Cardioversion, immediately check the monitor

If tachycardia persist, increase energy level and repeat

**More Notes:**  
**Perioperatively, sinus tachycardia was associated with:**  
Hypotension – most popular  
Normotension  
Hypertension  
Cardiac arrest

Sinus tachycardia and hypotension should be managed as hypotension. If you treat the hypotension, the HR should decrease to a normal rate.  
  
**Extensive differential Diagnosis for Perioperative Tachycardia**  
Catecholamine excess -Pain  
“Light” anesthesia  
Hypercapnea  
Hypoxemia  
Hypotension  
Hypovolemia  
Hypoglycemia  
Fever  
Sepsis

**Myocardial Ischemia  
**Malignant hyperthermia  
Pheochromocytoma  
Thyrotoxicosis  
Carcinoid Syndrome  
Tension Pneumothorax  
Pulmonary Embolism  
Cardiac Tamponade

**Medications**  
Pancuronium  
Desflurane  
Atropine  
Ephedrine  
Dopamine  
Epinephrine

**Identify the Cause  
**Vital Signs  
ST- segments  
End- tidal CO2/agent  
Ensure good oxygenation/ ventilation  
Adjust depth of anesthesia  
Correct Hypovolemia  
Correct low SVR – Narcotics  
Beta- Blockers may be useful, especially in patients with CAD and hypertension is involved.

**“Common things are common”**  
Light anesthesia, pain (surgical/ tourniquet/bladder), hypovolemia or hypotension will be the problem the vast majority of the time.
