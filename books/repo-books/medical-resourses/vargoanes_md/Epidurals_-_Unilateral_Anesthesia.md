### Epidural - Unilateral Anesthesia

**Also known as:  
**One sided block  
Asymmetric block**  
Unilateral Anesthesia and Epidurals:  
**Varied anatomy of the epidural space may lead to a non uniform spread of local anesthetic solution, resulting in the uncommon but frustrating problem of unilateral anesthesia.  
  
**Anatomical causes include:  
**A dorsomedian band in the midline of the epidural space  
Presence of epidural septae.  
Presence of a midline posterior epidural fat pad.  
Catheter being threaded (or migrating) too deep into the epidural (perhaps exiting a vertebral foramen.) Having the patient lie on one side for too long  
  
**Troubleshooting:**  
Roll the patient on her side and ensure that the catheter is at the proper depth at the skin  
  
**Catheter Migration:  
**Pull the epidural catheter back to the site where it was originally taped at skin and, after repositioning the patient on the side without the block, either give a manual bolus of a local anesthetic solution or ask that the patient press her PCEA button. If the catheter is still where it was originally taped, roll the patient on the side that has diminished analgesia, withdraw the catheter 1‐2 cm and bolus as above. Remember to aspirate prior to administering any bolus.
