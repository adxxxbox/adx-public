### Bilateral Myringotomy Adults-Anesthesia

A tiny incision is made in the eardrum (tympanic membrane) to allow fluid to drain from the middle ear.  
Myringotomy is often recommended to treat otitis media with effusion (fluid in the ear).  
  
**Adult Anesthesia:** Usually general with an LMA  
**Pediatric:** Mask  
**Position:** Supine with arms tucked  
**Duration:** 5-15 minutes  
  
Unlike a pediatric case, these procedures are more laid back and do not have multiple similar cases following.  
  
**Myringotomy in adults is not a common procedure.**  
Arriving early and preparing for many of these procedures is not warranted like pediatrics.
