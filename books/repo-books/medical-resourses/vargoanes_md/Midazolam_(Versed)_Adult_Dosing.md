Midazolam (Versed) Adult Dosing    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Midazolam (Versed) Adult Dosing

**Most common pre-op dose:** 2 mg IV  
**Most common pre-op dosing range:** 1-5 mg IV  
**Weigh bases pre-op recommended dose:** (rarely used in adults)0.01 to 0.05 mg/kg IV via slow injection or infusion over several minutes; the dose may be repeated in 10 to 15-minute intervals until sedation is achieved.  
**IV onset:** < 1 minute**Peak sedation:** 3-5 minutes  
  
**Induction dose:** 0.1-0.2 mg/kg (rarely used for induction)  
**IV induction onset with pre-administration of a narcotic:** 1.5 minutes  
**IV induction onset without concurrent administration of narcotics:** 2 - 2.5 minutes  
  
**Doses for status epilepticus (seizure):** 0.2 mg/kg IM or intranasal or 5 mg (1 spray) intranasally in 1 nostril ONCE.  
Subsequent dose: 5 mg (1 spray) intranasally in the opposite nostril after 10 minutes if the patient has not responded to the initial dose.  
**Maximum dose:** 10 mg/day  
  
**Continuous IV infusion (rare):**  
Maintenance dose 1-7 mg/hour.  
or  
0.06 to 0.12 mg/kg/hr (1 to 2 mcg/kg/min).  
The infusion rate can be increased or decreased (generally by 25% of the initial or subsequent infusion rate) as required, or supplemental intravenous doses of midazolam can be administered to increase or maintain the desired effect.  
  
**Adult continuous infusion in ICU for intubated patients:  
IV loading dose:** 0.05 to 0.2 mg/kg over at least 2 to 3 minutes can be used to establish the desired clinical effect in intubated patients.  
  
**IM (< 60 years):**  0.07 to 0.08 mg/kg once, up to 1 hour before surgery  
**IM onset of sedation in adults:** 15 minutes  
**IM peak sedation:** 30-60 minutes  
**IV onset for peds and adult sedation:** 3- 5 minutes  
Onset time is affected by the concurrent administration of narcotics.  
  
**Geriatric and** **debilitated patients:  
**Doses of midazolam should be decreased for elderly and for debilitated patients.  
**Geriatric patients** may have altered drug distribution and diminished hepatic and/or renal function.  
  
**Patients over 60 years of age:  
****IV dose for > 60 years:** **IV:** 1 mg slow IV every 2 minutes as neededDosage reductions by 30% are recommended or when narcotics are given concomitantly as a premedication.  
  
**Patients over 70 years:**  
These patients may be susceptible.  
Many anesthesia providers avoid premedicating these patients with midazolam.  
**Debilitated patients:**  
Additional reductions of 60% of the recommended dose are appropriate for debilitated patients.Many anesthesia providers avoid premedicating these patients with midazolam.  
  
**Geriatrics pharmacokinetic notes:  
**\- A study showed that the plasma half-life was approximately doubled in the elderly.  
\- It may be further influenced by obesity, renal, cardiac, or hepatic conditions, and certain drugs that inhibit the P450-3A4 enzyme.\- The mean volume distribution based on total body weight increased consistently between 15% to 100% in the elderly.  
\- The mean clearance decreased by approximately 25% in the elderly in two studies and was similar to that of the younger patients.
