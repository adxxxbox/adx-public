HELLP syndrome    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### HELLP Syndrome

**HELLP syndrome:** A combination of the breakdown of red blood cells (hemolysis), elevated liver enzymes and low platelets occurring in pregnancy.  
**H:** Hemolysis  
**E:** Elevated  
**L:** Liver enzymes**L:** Low**P:** Platelets  
  
HELLP syndrome is considered a **hypertensive pregnancy disorder.  
**Many consider it a complication (variant?) of severe preeclampsia.  
It is a form of severe pre-eclampsia, but also a clinical entity in itself.  
  
Most women with HELLP syndrome have preeclampsia.  
They both usually occur during the later stages of pregnancy, or sometimes after childbirth.  
It is often difficult to differentiate HELLP syndrome from preeclampsia.  
Most of these parturients deliver preterm.  
  
**HELLP syndrome vs preeclampsia facts:  
**15-20% of women with HELLP syndrome DO NOT have preeclampsia.  
but  
10-20 % of women with severe preeclampsia develop HELLP syndrome compared to 0.1- 0.8% in the general population.  
  
**Definitive treatment:** Deliver as quickly as possible.  
  
**HELLP syndrome can be confused with:  
**Hepatitis  
Gallbladder disease  
Viral illnesses  
Antiphospholipid syndrome  
Acute fatty liver with pregnancyBecause HELLP syndrome is multisystemic, these patients should be overseen by a specialized multidisciplinary team in a tertiary care center.  
  
**HELLP syndrome patients are an anesthesia and surgical concern due to an increased risk for:**Hemorrhagic complications  
DIC  
Acute renal failure  
ARDs  
Cerebral hemorrhage  
Preeclampsia  
Seizures  
**HELLP syndrome** was named by Dr. Louis Weinstein in 1982 after its characteristics:  
**H** (hemolysis) Bilirubin > 1.2 mg/dL  
**EL** (elevated liver enzymes) AST > 70IU/L LDH > 600 IU/L  
**LP** (low platelet count) < 100,000/mm3  
  
**Note:** **Severe preeclampsia (not mild) also has at least one below:  
**Hemolytic anemiaElevated liver enzymes  
Thrombocytopenia  
_Having ALL THREE above is what defines HELLP syndrome.  
_  
**Risk factors:  
Older maternal age:** Mean age is 25 years (mean age for preeclampsia is 19 years)  
White race/European descent  
Previous pregnancy with HELLP (2-27%)  
White race/European descent (preeclampsia is over represented among Blacks)  
**  
Etiology of low platelets (thrombocytopenia):**  
Thrombocytopenia is attributed to increased platelet consumption due to vascular endothelial damage.  
The severity of thrombocytopenia correlates with the severity of disease.  
**Statistic and facts:  
**48,000 women per year develop HELLP syndrome.  
If untreated it can cause death.  
HELLP syndrome occurs in 0.2 to 0.6% of all pregnancies  
Usually occurs in the last 3 months of pregnancy  
It may occur earlier, or even right after pregnancy – 1 or 2 days after the baby is born.  
Preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome both have hypertension and proteinuria.  
  
**Onset:** Usually in the antepartum period; however, onset in the immediate postpartum period can occur in 15% to 20% of patients.  
Postpartum hemorrhage is not uncommon.  
  
**HELLP syndrome also has:**  
Severe hematological abnormalities.  
  
**Microangiopathic hemolysis and acute renal failure:  
**Microangiopathic hemolysis can be severe enough to cause anemia.  
DIC complicates 20% of cases (85% of cases involving acute renal failure).  
  
**Hemolytic anemia:  
**A term used to describe the anemia that results from physical damage to the red cells caused by the occlusion of arterioles and capillaries as a result of fibrin deposition or platelet aggregation.  
  
**HELLP syndrome classifications:**  
The severity of HELLP syndrome is measured according to the blood platelet count of the mother and divided into three categories, according to a system called "the Mississippi classification."  
**Class I** (severe thrombocytopenia): platelets under 50,000/mm3  
**Class II** (moderate thrombocytopenia): platelets between 50,000 and 100,000/mm3  
**Class III** (AST > 40 IU/L, mild thrombocytopenia): platelets between 100,000 and 150,000/mm3  
  
**Risk of HELLP in future pregnancies:  
**Women with a history of HELLP syndrome are at increased risk for all forms of preeclampsia in subsequent pregnancies.  
The rate of preeclampsia in subsequent pregnancies ranges from 16 to 52%, with higher rates if the onset of HELLP syndrome was in the second trimester.  
The rate of recurrent HELLP syndrome ranges from 2 to 19% depending upon the patient population studied.  
**  
The condition does not present an absolute contraindication to neuraxial anesthesia:  
**HELLP syndrome is not necessarily a contraindication to neuraxial anesthesia – many cases have been safely managed with neuraxial anesthesia.  
(Wong, Cynthia, from the textbook: Spinal and Epidural Anesthesia).  
  
**Low platelets (thrombocytopenia):**Platelets are known to drop precipitously and should be rechecked if the initial platelet count is not recent.  
Neuraxial techniques are safe as long as the platelet count remains > 75,000 and other coagulation parameters are normal.  
Ensure that the platelet count remains > 75,000 before catheter removal.  
_General anesthesia is the method of choice when platelet count is lower than 50,000.  
_  
**Thrombocytopenia and neuraxial anesthesia:  
**It is necessary to check a screening platelet count on patients with pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders, (e.g., pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome).Thrombocytopenia is considered a relative contraindication to neuraxial analgesia because of the unknown risk of hematoma.  
However, there is no general agreement on the platelet count threshold for withholding neuraxial anesthesia.  
Preoperative platelet transfusion should be strongly considered when platelet count is low.  
  
The decision to proceed with neuraxial anesthesia depends on the downward trend of platelet count and clinical signs of bleeding or coexisting coagulopathy rather than an arbitrary threshold value.  
Most practitioners recommend against catheter placement if the platelet count is less than 75,000.  
Other causes of coagulopathy must be ruled out.  
  
A TEG (Thromboelastogram) can be performed to assess a detailed assessment of coagulopathy.  
Bleeding time has not been shown to be a helpful parameter in assessing patients for coagulopathy, as it often doesn’t correlate well with clinical bleeding.  
  
**Presentation of HELLP syndrome  
**Often nonspecific, may preset as preeclampsia.  
Nausea, vomiting, epigastric /RUQ pain (30-90%) resulting from liver distentionHeadache (33-68%)  
Visual changes (10-20%)  
Jaundice (5%) resulting from hemolysis and increased bilirubin.  
Bleeding  
Edema  
  
**Signs include:**  
Hypertension  
Proteinuria  
  
**Diagnosis:**  
**There are various diagnostic criteria to define HELLP syndrome, which can be classified as “true/complete” if all of the following are present:**  
Platelets <100,000  
Hepatic dysfunction with AST >70 IU/L; and  
Evidence of hemolysis.  
  
**Diagnosis criteria for HELLP syndrome:  
Hemolysis:** Abnormal peripheral blood smear**BMP: increased bilirubin >** 1.2mg/dL  
**Increased LDH >** 600 IU/L (elevated by hemolysis)  
**Increased AST** **³** 70 IU/L  
**Platelet count <** 100,000  
**Serum haptoglobin:** Low  
**BUN/Cr:** Elevated  
**Fibrinogen:** Low  
**D-Dimer** (High)  
  
**Other labs:**  
Microangiopathic anemia with presence of schistocytes on a smear.  
  
**PT/PTT:** Normal PT and variable PTT (because thrombocytopenia and altered coagulation factors are present).  
PTT may be normal or high.  
  
**Serum amylase and lipase** (to differentiate from acute fatty of pregnancy AFLP).  
Serum amylase and lipase are increased in AFLP.  
Serum amylase and lipase are normal in HELLP syndrome.  
HELLP and AFLP may have similar presentations.  
**  
Objective lab picture:**  
Typical appearance of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) with liver dysfunction.  
However, in the context of a pregnancy and in the presence of preeclamptic symptoms, HELLP syndrome is suspected.Anemia should be present; however, RBCs may be normocytic due to the hemoconcentration resulting from fluid shifts that also cause edema.  
  
**Fibrin degradation products and d-dimer:**  
Fibrin degradation products and d-dimer, markers of subclinical DIC, have been used to help predict which patients with preeclampsia are at higher risk of developing the HELLP syndrome.  
(Padden, MO, HELLP Syndrome, recognition and perinatal management, American Family Physician, 60(3):829-36, 839).  
  
**Differential diagnosis:**  
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy  
Idiopathic thrombocytopenia  
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura  
Hemolytic uremic syndrome  
Systemic lupus erythematosus  
Cholecystitis  
Cholangitis  
Appendicitis  
**  
Magnesium Sulfate Drip:  
**Most HELLP syndrome patients will receive MgSO4 infusion for seizure prophylaxis.  
Dosing should be 4 to 5 grams administered over 5 minutes, followed by 1 gram per hour for 24 hours.  
  
**Management of laboratory-confirmed HELLP syndrome:  
Stabilize condition:  
**Fetal assessment; fetal heart tomes  
IV access  
Foley to monitor I & O  
  
**Medications:**  
**Antihypertensives** (hydralazine or labetalol)  
**BP goal:** Goal 130-140 mmHg systolic and 90-100 mmHg diastolic)  
**Seizure prophylaxis:** Magnesium sulfate  
**Liver/platelet counts:** Dexamethasone  
Dexamethasone is protective of the liver and also matures the fetal lungs  
  
**Periodically recheck CBC and LFT:**If there is a worsening of LFTs, get an abdominal CT to look for subcapsular hematoma, a HELLP syndrome complication.  
  
**Antihypertensive meds:  
**Most of these patients are being treated for hypertension.  
The goal is to keep systolic BP < 150mmHg and diastolic < 100mmHg.  
Intracranial hemorrhage is prevented more correcting systolic rather than diastolic pressure.  
Be cautious with **beta blockers** because they will affect the fetus/newborn’s heart rate  
  
Consider **dexmedetomidine** in preeclamptic patients to blunt hormonal and hemodynamic changes before endotracheal intubation.**  
Delivery:  
**If the parturient becomes unstable, consider an emergency c-section.  
_Delivery is the only cure for HELLP syndrome.  
_Obstetric providers should communicate coagulation status to anesthesia providers.  
  
**If parturient is** **≥ 34 weeks** **and stable:** Administer dexamethasone and deliver after 24-48 hours.  
**If parturient is < 34 weeks and stable:** Administer dexamethasone and evaluate for delivery. Delay delivery as long as safely possible to allow fetal lung maturation.  
**  
Anesthesia and HELLP syndrome:  
**A multidisciplinary approach is needed for effective, safe perioperative management.  
  
**Monitor closely for:  
**Hemorrhagic complications  
DICEclampsia  
  
**Preoperative risk:  
**High maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.  
Has an increased rate of cesarian sections.  
Increased risk of intraoperative hemorrhage.  
  
**Pre-op labs:** (similar to preeclampsia)CBC with smear  
PT/PTTFibrinogen  
LFTs  
BMP  
Serum amylase and lipaseTEG is an option.  
Consider ABG if an arterial line is used.  
  
**BP:** Up to 20% of patients DO NOT have antecedent hypertension.**Airway assessment:** Assess for airway edema (dyspnea or voice change)  
Video laryngoscope (e.g., GlideScope®) should be available.**Assess for acute renal failure:** Oliguria  
Consider a central line and CVP monitoring if oliguria is present.  
  
**Assess for onset of thrombocytopenia:** Petechiae  
**  
Spinal and C-section:  
**If moderate thrombocytopenia is present and not progressively worsening, c-section under spinal anesthesia is the preferable approach.  
  
If general anesthesia is required, diminish the hemodynamic consequences of direct laryngoscopy.  
This decreases the risk of intracranial hemorrhage.  
  
**Arterial line:** Not frequently used.  
**Large-bore IVs** and generous hydration.  
Video laryngoscope should be immediately available to manage the possible difficult intubation.  
Central line and CVP are no longer frequently used.  
This situation requires large-bore IVs and generous hydration.  
  
**Serious complications associated with HELLP syndrome:  
**Abruptio placentaeAcute renal failure  
Subscapular liver hematoma is a rare complication.  
ARDS  
Cerebral hemorrhage  
DIC  
Eclampsia  
Postpartum hemorrhage  
Pulmonary edema  
Retinal detachment  
Hepatic rupture  
**  
Postpartum consults:  
**Hematology for platelet count  
Nephrology for assessment of renal function.  
General surgery if subcapsular hematoma is present  
  
Dexamethasone is usually administered postpartum.**Prognosis:  
****HELLP syndrome and fetal outcome:  
**Maternal and fetal complications are more severe in HELLP than in pre-eclampsia alone.  
If a baby weighs at least 2 pounds (over 1000 grams) at birth, he or she has the same survival rate and health outcome of non-HELLP babies of the same size.  
Babies under 2 pounds at delivery don't do well.  
These babies will need longer hospital stays and will have more frequent need for ventilator care.  
  
**Mortality:  
**HELLP syndrome maternal mortality ranges from 1%-3%.  
Perinatal mortality rate: 35%.  
Complete HELLP is associated with the highest incidence of perinatal morbidity and mortality.  
  
**Patients with class 1:** 60% of deaths occur  
Cerebral hemorrhage is the most common autopsy finding.  
  
**Morbidity includes the following:**  
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (20%)  
Placental abruption (16%)  
Acute renal failure (7%)  
Pulmonary edema (6%)  
**Fetal morbidity and mortality rates:** Range from 9%-24%  
Usually result from:  
Placental abruption  
Intrauterine asphyxia  
Prematurity  
  
**Overall perinatal mortality:** (stillbirth plus neonatal death): Ranges from 7.7 to 60%.  
**Most of these deaths are attributed to:**  
Placental abruption  
Placental failure with intrauterine asphyxia and extreme prematurity.
