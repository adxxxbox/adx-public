### Mitral Valve Replacement (MVR) for Stenosis

Removal of the stenotic valve and the placement of a new one.

**Common Pre-op diagnosis**:  
Class 3 or 4 CHF  

**The Procedure**  
Mitral Valve Replacement (MVR) for Stenosis The left atrium is exposed through a ventricle incision in the left atrium posterior to the atrial septum. The surgeon then excises and debrides the valve leaflets and applies sutures to the rim of the annulus. The new valve is passed through and sutured in place to the rim of the annulus. After filling the LV and atrium with blood, the atrium is closed, air evacuated from the left heart and the cross clamp removed to allow coronary perfusion.

**Pre-op Equipment and IV Access**:  
Same as a CABG

  
**Catheters**  
2 large peripheral IVs 16-18g -LR  
A-line  
PA Catheter  
Trauma line or a Cordis  

**PA Line Ports**:  
**White** port connects to trifurcate ports: a Neo drip, a Nitro drip and LR.  
**Brown** to CVP  
**Blue** to PA  
Colors may vary at different hospitals.  
Cordis or Trauma line- Blood tubing –connect main blood tubing.  
**Have 2 blood sets** –one on warmer, one to trauma cord.

  
Make sure all IVs run well BEFORE and AFTER the arms are tucked. I have seen terrible infiltrations with tucked arms.

**Heart Rate**: Keep HR 50-70 bpm.  
Avoid tachycardia. Tachycardia reduces the time for diastolic filling of the LV, thereby worsening the mitral stenosis. Treat tachycardia aggressively with beta blockers.  
Use Robinul before Atropine.

**Rhythm:** Often in A-fib; try to control the ventricular response.  
New onset of Afib/flutter should be cardioverted immediately.  
**Contractility:** Maintain it. LV usually OK until after bypass; RV may be impaired.

**Preload**: Maintain or slightly increase it to help with LV filling. Excess preload may cause pulmonary edema.  
**Afterload:** Keep low systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance (SVR and PVR). Avoid vasoconstrictors. Treat hypotension with fluid; but beware of pulmonary edema. Occasional Neosynephrine may be used to maintain SVR.

**  
MVO²**: Usually not a problem. Most departments don’t measure it.  
**Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**Muscle Relaxant:** Avoid Pavulon, it can increase HR.  
**EBL:** 200-500mLs  
**Type and Cross:** Yes, have blood available in the room.  
  
**Pre-bypass:**  
Pre-load: Use enough to maintain flow across stenosis.  
Afterload: Avoid increased Right ventricular afterload (pulmonary vasoconstrictors).  
Use inotropes for systemic hypotension.  
Contractility: LV is usually OK, until after CPB.  
RV may be impaired due to chronic Pulmonary HTN.

**Aortic Clamp time**: 45-150 minutes.  
**Note:** For any open heart, barbiturates or Etomidate may be given when the cross clamp is removed to avoid micro infarcts of air by Burst Suppressing the patient. Only some do this.  
**CPB Time:** 90-120 minutes

**Avoid factors that cause pulmonary vasoconstriction**:  
Hypercarbia  
Acidosis  
Hypothermia  
SNS activation  
Hypoxia  
High inspiratory pressures

LA pressures > 25 mm Hg will lead to acute pulmonary edema, and if present in the long term will lead to increased PVR.

**Weaning Off Bypass**:  
TEE is essential for coming off bypass for fluid, hemodynamic management and for assistance in removing air from the heart. It will give you the LV function and a good look at the results of the new valve. Treat the patient according to their individual needs, just like any other heart. MVR resolves the obstruction to LV filling, so hemodynamic status usually improves quickly. Elevated PA and PVR are usually decreased immediately after the new valve.

**Post By-pass**  
Contractility of the LV is usually OK until after bypass; the RV may be impaired if there is long-standing pulmonary hypertension. Vasodilators may help post-bypass RV failure; control of ventricular response may be difficult.  
Despite the increased risk of RV failure, when struggling to come off bypass, the LV is most often at fault, either due to surgical injury or sudden distension of a chronically volume depleted ventricle.

Mitral Valve Repair resolves the obstruction of LV filling; therefore, in post-bypass period, the hemodynamic status usually improves. PA and PVR pressures usually decrease unless there is severe pulmonary HTN and RV dysfunction preoperatively.  
  
**Milrinone (Primacor)** is a great inotrope and vasodilator beneficial for pulmonary HTN and RV dysfunction.

If the patient has tachycardia, decreased BP and an elevated PCWP-Neosynephrine is the best drug. It increases SVR and decreases HR.  
  
Note that after a surgical repair, V waves are almost always seen and represent LA filling from the right (because cardiac output is increased post-repair), and not mitral regurgitation.

**Mitral Stenosis Facts**  
90% present with CHF and A-fib  
Thrombi from LA a real possibility  
\>Hemoptysis might be seen  
Auscultation reveals a rumbling diastolic murmur at heart’s apex.

**Common Drips Coming Off Pump**  
**Milrinone - (Primacor)**  
Basically a good inotropic and vasodilator.  
**Adult Loading Dose-** IV 50 mcg/kg over 10 min  
**Maintenance Infusion**:  
0.375-0.75 mcg/kg/min  
This drug decreases PVR; it is a potent pulmonary vasodilator. It is great for valves or any patient with pulmonary hypertension. It decreases SVR afterload as mentioned above. It decreases Preload CVP. It enhances relaxation of the left ventricle by way of the Lusitropic effect. Finally, it decreases PCWP.

  
**Neo-synephrine Drip**: Titrate to effect. It is OK to use Neo once the new valve is in.  
Other constrictors that increase SVR are also OK.
