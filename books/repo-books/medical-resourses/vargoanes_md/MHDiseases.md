## Diseases Linked to Malignant Hyperthermia (MH)

_Edited by Dan Lovinaria, DNP, MS, MBA, APRN, CRNA_

**Today as we know, there are only 2-3 diseases (literature varies) that are definitively linked to MH**

Central Core Disease - (a genetic disease of the ryanodine receptor)  
King Dendorough Syndrome  
Minicore myopathy-not mentioned by MHAUS

**Lumbee Indians**  
North Carolina physicians have documented that Lumbee American Indians have been more susceptible to MH.

**King-Denborough syndrome (KDS)  
**KDS is a rare condition characterized by a triad of dysmorphic features, malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS), and myopathy. Characteristics include:  
Short stature  
Small jaw  
Pigeon chest  
Kyphoscoliosis  
Musculoskeletal abnormalities  
Mental retardation  
Some may also have central core disease

**Central core disease is characterized by:**  
Central core disease gets its name from disorganized areas called cores, which are found in the center of muscle fibers in many affected individuals.  
This condition causes skeletal muscle weakness that ranges from almost unnoticeable to very severe. This weakness affects the muscles near the center of the body (proximal muscles), particularly muscles in the upper legs and hips.

**Minicore myopathy - also known as Multiminicore disease  
**Some of the non-classic forms of minicore myopathy are associated with errors in the RYR1 gene. Another skeletal muscle weakness disease that may range from mild to life-threatning. Multiminicore disease gets its name from small, disorganized areas called minicores, which are found in muscle fibers of many affected individuals. These abnormal regions can only be seen under a microscope.

**Other diseases associated with adverse anesthetic reactions that look similar to MH but are NOT MH:  
These patients are NOT at risk for MH!**  
Muscle damage: Muscular dystrophy  
Fever: Ostergenesis imperfect  
Mitichondria diseases

**Neuroleptic malignant syndrome:** appears similar and may be mistaken for MH due to its clinical presentation. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is caused by psychotropic drugs. These patients are also NOT at risk for MH.

**Symptoms of Neuroleptic malignant syndrome**  
Severe muscular rigidity  
Hyperthermia  
Autonomic instability  
Diaphoresis  
Pallor  
Dyspnea  
Tremors  
Incontinence  
Tachycardia  
Psychomotor agitation  
Delirium progressing to lethargy, stupor, coma
