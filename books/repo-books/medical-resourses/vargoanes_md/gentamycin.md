# Gentamycin

**Gentamycin**  
An Aminoglycoside  
**Indication:**  
Aerobic gram negative / positive bacteria.  
**Doses:**  
**For a one time daily dose:**  
5mg/kg IV over 30 minutes  
Male in kg = 50kg + 2.3kg for each inch over 5 feet  
Female in kg = 45.5kg + 2.3kg for each inch over 5 feet.  
**Conventional Dose:**  
1.7mg/kg Q8  
**Peds**  
Children <5 years: 7.5mg/kg/day in divided doses Q8h  
Children >5 years: 6-7.5mg/kg/day IV Q8h  
Once daily dosing: 5mg/kg IV Q 24  
**MOA**  
Inhibits protein synthesis  
**Gentamycin Induced Neuromuscular Blockade**  
Aminoglycosides can cause dose-related neuromuscular blockade and muscle weakness, particularly in patients with neuromuscular disease or hypocalcemia and in patients receiving general anesthetics, neuromuscular blocking agents, or massive transfusions of citrate-anticoagulated blood.  
Paralysis can be treated with IV calcium or Neostigmine.  
**Potental Adverse Effects of Gentamycin**  
Ototoxicity - from high doses or for prolonged periods of time.  
Balance difficulty  
Bouncing, unsteady vision  
Ringing in the ears (tinnitus)  
Difficulty multi-tasking, particularly when standing  
Aminoglycosides are toxic to the sensory cells of the ear. Gentamicin is a vestibulotoxin, and can cause permanent loss of equilibrioception, caused by damage to the vestibular apparatus of the inner ear.  
**Renal Damage**  
Gentamicin, like other aminoglycosides, causes nephrotoxicity by inhibiting protein synthesis in renal cells. This mechanism specifically causes necrosis of cells in the proximal tubule, resulting in acute tubular necrosis which can lead to ARF.
