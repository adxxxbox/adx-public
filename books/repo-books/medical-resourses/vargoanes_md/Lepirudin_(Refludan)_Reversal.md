### Lepirudin (Refludan) Reversal

_Currently, there is a lack of specific antidotes for the growing number of new (novel) anticoagulants that are slowly replacing warfarin and heparin. For this reason, there is NO universal standard of care for the treatment of the anticoagulated bleeding patient when there is no specific antidote._

**Consult cardiology for ALL patients with coronary stents.**  
  
**Quick Notes**  
**Lepirudin (Refludan)** is a Direct Thrombin Inhibitor (DTI).  
**T1/2:** 1.3 hours.  
  
**Half- life with CrCl < 15mL/min:** . up to 2 days  
Systemic clearance in women is about 25% lower than in men.  
In elderly patients, about 20% lower than in younger patients.  
Very little literature available.  
  
**Specific Antidote:** None.  
  
**Reversal:** Consider FFP & cryoprecipitate.  
Literature states that either hemofiltration or hemodialysis (using high-flux dialysis membranes with a cutoff point of 50,000 daltons, eg, AN/69) may be useful.  
  
**Monitor:** aPTT is the main test that can be monitored when needed.  
PT/INR and _Ecarin clotting time_ (ECT) are also affected in a dose dependent fashion.
