## Aspiration-Gastric

Pulmonary aspiration is defined by the inhalation of oropharyngeal or gastric contents into the larynx and the respiratory tract.  
  
Regurgitation and/or aspiration should always be considered immediately in any spontaneously breathing patient who suffers desaturation, laryngospasm, airway obstruction, bronchospasm, bradycardia, or cardiac arrest.

**Solid Matter Aspiration:** may cause hypoxia by physical obstruction.

**Acid Gastric Fluid Aspiration under anesthesia (Mendelson's Syndrome):** a chemical burning pneumonitis, which may cause epithelial damage, dyspnea, hypoxia, bronchial wheezing, secondary bacterial infection, consolidated x-ray, ARDs and death.  
Named after the American anesthesiologist **Curtis L. Mendelson**, who described it in 1946.

Aspiration under anesthesia is greater with a higher ASA status and emergency surgery.

**Treatment**  
Call for anesthesia help, difficult airway cart and a Glide Scope.  
Suction the airway with a Yankauer  
Clear the airway with McGill forceps if needed  
  
**Aspiration with an LMA  
**Remove the LMA ASAP  
Turn the patient’s head to the side  
Suction the oropharynx with a yankauer  
If severe, consider Fiberoptic Bronchoscopy with suction  
Intubate

**Is the patient actively vomiting?  
**Turn the patient’s head to the side  
Consider cricoid pressure to prevent passive regurgitation  
Tell the surgeon to temporarily stop and place head down –Trendelenburg  
(Some anesthesia providers still insist on placing the head up)  
RSI

**Bronchoscopy**  
Consider Bronchoscopy to suction and remove aspiration contents  
Do not lavage airway during bronchoscopy  
  
**If the patient starts wheezing  
**Multiple puffs of Proventil  
Increase sevoflurane-if intubated/LMA or mask ventilating  
Solu-Medrol (Methylprednisolone)- 125mg (controversial)  
  
**When bronchial constriction worsens-still in the operating room  
Consider the following IV bronchodilators:**  
**Ephedrine** -2 5mg (if not contraindicated).  
**Epinephrine** - 0.1- 0.5 mL of 1:1000 of Epinephrine (if not contraindicated).  
**Isuprel** – 0.01-0.02mg (Dilute 1mL (0.2mg) to 10mL of NS.  
Bolus: Bolus initial dose (if not contraindicated).  
May repeat.

**Magnesium Sulfate** - 2grams IV over 20 minutes (more cardiac friendly).

**Ventilator Settings/Changes  
**Switch to or increase Sevoflurane.  
Tidal volumes: 5-6mL/kg.  
PEEP: 5-10cmH20.  
Lower your peak flow rates (more laminar flow and less turbulent).  
KEEP peak pressures < 30cmH20.  
  
Consider Extubation at the end of the case unless the patient is difficult to oxygenate or hypoxemia.

**Post-op  
**Obtain chest X-ray.  
Aerosol Treatments for wheezing.  
Consider ICU admission based on chest X-ray and oxygenation/ventilation status.

**More Notes**  
Aspiration-Gastric  
Mendelson’s Syndrome Symptoms  
Develops rapidly (2-12 hours after aspiration) and within hours the patient may become:  
Tachypnoeic.  
Hypoxic.  
Febrile.  
Bronchospasm with need for increasing ventilation pressure.  
Bronchial hyper-secretion.  
Pulmonary vasoconstriction.  
Cyanosis.

Usually there is minimal sputum production.

**Radiographic features**  
Chest X-ray or CT may depict fleeting infiltrates (which do not last more than 1 or 2 days), atelectasis and non-cardiac lung edema.

**Differential diagnosis  
**Cardiac failure.Amniotic fluid embolism.  
Passive regurgitation occurred three times more commonly than active vomiting.  
Aspiration, regurgitation and vomiting incidents were reported twice as commonly following elective surgery in comparison with emergency surgery. We intubate emergency cases.
