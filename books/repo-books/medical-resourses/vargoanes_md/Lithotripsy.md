Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL)     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL)

"Extracorporeal" means outside the body.

This is the most common type of lithotripsy.

It has become the preferred tool for the noninvasive treatment of renal stones, proximal stones, and midureteral stones.

The patient lies on an exam table on top of a soft, water-filled cushion. It pulverizes calculi into smaller fragments (<1mm), which the body can pass spontaneously and painlessly over the next few days.  
It is loud and painful.

They usually localize stones with a C-arm so you will need a lead apron. 

Sometimes the urologist inserts a stent ahead of time if the stone is large.

This case is rarely done with anesthesia anymore. These seem to be done more on “Mobile Lithotripsy Trucks.” A urology nurse usually just gives the patient sedation using versed and fentanyl.  
 

**Anesthetic:** MAC (Versed and Fentanyl or Propofol infusion).  
Spinal is optional, but rare

**Position:** Supine and sometimes Prone

**Duration:** 45 minutes to 1 hour

**IV Access:** 22G is acceptable  
  
**Possible Complications**  
Complications are related mostly to residual stone fragments, infections, and effects on tissues such as urinary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, genital, and reproductive systems.  
  
**Contraindications:**  
Ureter Stone  
Pregnant  
Bleeding disorder  
Elevated Coags  
UTI

Kidney CA  
Uncorrected obstruction distal to the stone  
Kidneys with abnormal structure or function.  
Pacemaker must be cleared by a cardiologist.

**More Notes:**  
For 9 out of 10 patients who have kidney stones smaller than 10 mm (0.4 in.)- the stones are either in the kidney or in the ureter.  
ESWL gets rid of all of the stone or leaves only small fragments that don't cause any symptoms.
