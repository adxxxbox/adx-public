## Blood Transfusion Facts

**(For more blood products - refer to “Drug Box” link)**

Incident of immediate hemolytic transfusion reactions is estimated to be 1 per 6,000-7,000 units transfused.  

**False theory today**: PRBC transfusion increases O2 delivery by increasing Hb levels.  
Normally an increase in Hgb increases the O2 carrying capacity, but due to specifics of stored PRBCs, there can be a DECREASE of oxygen released/consumed at the tissue level.  
Remember normal RBCs have to change shape going through those narrow little capillaries? PRBCs bypass more tissue because they are less likely make it through the capillaries due to rigidity and constriction of capillary sphincters.

**RBC Transfusion Infections**  
Sepsis  
10-12% of transfusion related deaths.  
Yersinia, Serratia, Psuedomonas, Enterobacter and Staph.  
1:25k platelets  
1:250k for RBCs

**RBC Transfusion Infection Rate**  
HBV - 1:6k-320k  
HIV 1:1.2M-11M  
CMV 1:10-1:30  
EBV 1:200  
HCV 1:1.2M-13M  
Malaria 1:3M-1:4M

**Top 3 causes of Transfusion Associated Deaths**  

**TRALI (Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury)**  

-   Involves 1 of 3 transfusion related deaths.
-   Occurs 2-6 hours after transfusion that involves Plasma.
-   Hypoxemia with SaO2 <90%.
-   Associated with significant morbidity.
-   All required oxygen support for a mean of 40 hours.
-   Mechanical ventilation was required in 72 percent.
-   Mortality in 6 percent.
-   CXR- infiltrates after transfusion.

**Clinical Picture of TRALI.**  

-   Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.
-   Difficult to distinguish from Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.
-   Pulmonary edema arises from capillary injury rather than volume overload.

**TACO Transfusion Associated Circulatory Overload**

-   1-10% occurrence.  
    
-   2nd leading cause of transfusion related deaths.
-   Occurs with 4-6 hours after transfusion.
-   Usually Has 4 of the 6 below:

-   Acute Respiratory Distress
-   Tachycardia
-   Increased BP (TRALI has decreased BP).
-   CXR-acute pr worsening Pulmonary edema.
-   Evidence of positive fluid balance.
-   It is difficult to determine the incidence of TACO, but its incidence is estimated at about one in every 100 to 10,000 transfusions. The risk increases with patients over the age of 60 and patients with cardiac or pulmonary failure, or anemia.

-   The HYPOtension seen with TRALI and the HYPERtension seen with TACO provides a clinical differentiation of the two.
-   Transfusion Associated Circulatory Overload is easily prevented by closely monitoring patients receiving transfusions and transfusing smaller volumes of blood at a slower rate.
-   TACO occurs in 1-8% of patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty. It is precipitated by positive fluid balance and high transfusion flow rates. TACO is characterized by respiratory distress and acute pulmonary edema.

**TRIM Transfusion-related immunomodulation**  

-   A syndrome that leads to immunosuppression.
-   It was discovered with renal transplants. Those who had transfusions actually had enhanced survival.
-   Alteration in T-cells, B-cells and APCs

**More reactions:**  
**RBC TRANSFUSION Non-Infectious Reaction**  
1-3% allergic reaction.  
1:50K have Anaphylactic reaction.  
ABO incompatibility.  
Delayed Hemolytic Reaction occurs 3-10 days after transfusion.  
1:2k-11k.

**Anti-RBC antibodies or previous infusion**  
Acute Hemolytic Reaction occurs with 24 hours of transfusion.  
ABO incompatabilty-1/3 of all related deaths.

**Transfusion Associated Acute Kidney Injury**  
Noted in cardiac patients after receiving transfusions.  
Increased Creatinine  
Longer hospital stays  
Cardiac Surgery Patients 

**More NOTES (Pretty cool facts)**  
There was no benefits with transfusion with a HCT as low as 21%  
Risk of death within 30 days of surgery is 6x greater than someone who did not receive transfusion.

**More likely to experience infections and ischemic complications**  
Transfusion of as little as 1 Unit RBC is associated with a decreased 10-year survival after a CABG  
Despite the patient's HCT, blood transfusions were not associated with lower ischemia,MI's, renal injury or comorbidities

**Stored PRBCs**  
Decreased 2,3 DPG  
Decreased pH  
\> Decreased Temp  
Increased K+  
Membrane Rupture  
Lipid Release  
Once the PRBCs are transfused, there is a left shift and less oxygen is released.  
**Leal Noval, et al: 897 Cardiac Surgey Patient**

Each 1 day increase in age of PRBCs = 6% in risk of pneumonia  
**Vamvakas & Carvin:**  
416 CABG patients, retrospect study, each 1 day increase in stored PRBCs = 1% increase in Pneumonia.  
However, there are some other studies that say there is no correlation.

**At Capillary Level, Oxygen delivery is NOT better**  
Nitric oxide depletion - loss of vasodilation  
Kidney, small intestines, loose endothelial junctions  
RBC Membrane shape disruption, stiffening  
Causes "short - circuiting" of capillary beds  
You see a better blood pressure, but worsening tissue oxygenation/ischemia  
Remember normal RBCs have to change shape going through those narrow little capillaries? PRBCs bypass more tissue because they are less likely make it through the capillaries due to rigidity and constriction of capillary sphincters.

**Constatino et al: Critical Care Forum**  
RBC transfusion compared to 5% Albumin resulted In:  
Increased PVR  
Increased ventricular work index  
No increase in O2 uptake  
No change in gastric mucosal pH

**Hebert et al, review of 18 studies in effects of PRBC Transfusions**  
All increased Hb levels  
In 4/18, no increase in tissue delivery of VO2  
In 14/18, DO2 increased, but not VO2  
There is little evidence that RBC Transfusions consistently improve clinical indices of tissue hypoxia in the critically ill with a Hb > 8g/dL   
**Walsh & Saleh, Anemia during critiacal illness, British Journal of Anesthesia 97 (3): 278-91 (2006)**

**Supporting Indications of Blood Transfusions**  
Uncontrolled or Active Hemorrhage  
Tissue ischemia - i.e. shock (cardiac, muscle, visceral, etc)

**NOT Indicators**  
Anemia  
Arbitrary Hemoglobin measurement  
Decreased CO or BP

**Biggest Indicator**  
Intraoperative, unstable  
Active, uncontrolled hemorrhage  
Tissue Ischemia - verified via lactate levels, pH, base deficit and increasing Creatinine.  
**American Society of Anesthesiologists Guidelines**  
**Recommended for** <6g/dL  
**Rarely needed for >**10g/dL  
**For 6-10g/dL, evaluate clinical evidence**  
For elective surgery, anemic patients can take EPO and Fe-oral to build up their Hb levels starting 28 days prior to surgery.  
Autologous Donations  
1/3 still get discarded and can still get TRALI.

**Cool Facts to remember**  
70kg pt has 5L of Blood  
1L crystalloid causes a 17% reduction in Hb  
So starting Hb will go from 12g/dL down to 10g/dL.  
Remember that blood transfusions are not always about saving lives or having a happy ending to the story, they also carry several risks.  
Believe that having a blood transfusion brings more problems compared to a blood transfusion alternative.  
Three out of ten people get some type of infection after they have a blood transfusion.  
By having a blood transfusion in a hospital visit, your bill increases up to 70%
