### EGD for Removal of Obstructed Food Bolus

Foreign body ingestion is commonly seen in children.  
Food bolus impaction is more frequent in adults.**Also known as:** Esophageal food bolus impaction  
  
**Management:** EGD for extraction requiring general anesthesia and RSI.  
  
**Statistics and facts:  
Annual incidence:** 13 episodes per 100,000  
**  
Possible causes:  
**Poorly chewed meat and swallowed precipitously  
Benign esophageal  
Esophageal stenoses  
Webs  
Extrinsic compression  
Surgical anastomosis  
Esophagitis-usually eosinophilic esophagitis  
Motor disorders such as achalasia  
**  
Possible signs and symptoms of esophageal food bolus impaction:  
**Retching and emesis  
Hypersalivation  
Diffuse chest pain or pressure  
Dysphagia  
Odynophagia (a sensation of choking)  
Neck or throat pain   
  
**Possible respiratory symptoms from compression of the trachea:  
**Aspiration of saliva or food  
Complete airway obstruction (rare)  
Stridor  
Coughing  
Wheezing  
Choking  
  
**Possible signs and symptoms of esophageal perforation (may require surgery):**  
Fever  
Tachycardia  
Subcutaneous crepitus  
Swelling of the neck or chest  
  
**Management:** EGD procedureFlexible endoscopy is used to push the food bolus into the stomach or extract it from the esophagus. Usually, extract it.  
  
**Anesthesia: General/ETT with RSI  
Anesthesia goal:** Protect the patient’s airway from inadvertent aspiration of saliva and retained esophageal food contents and the food itself.  
**Position:** Supine with head to the left or left lateral  
**Duration:** 15 minutes to 1-2 hours
