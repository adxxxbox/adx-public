Mastoidectomy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Mastoidectomy

Removal of an infected portion of the mastoid bone when antibiotics are not effective. The infected mastoid air cells (open spaces containing air that are located throughout the mastoid bone) are a result of the spread of ear infections, such as mastoiditis or chronic otitis media or by inflammatory disease of the middle ear (cholesteatoma).

**  
Anesthetic**: General/ETT or sometimes an LMA.  
Positioning: Supine with patient’s head turned away with ipsilateral arm tucked.  
**Muscle Relaxation**: Depends on facial nerve monitoring.  
**Duration:** 1-2.5 hours; depends on the surgeon.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
**Facial Nerve Monitoring:** Usually; check with the surgeon.  
**Emergence:** Smooth  
**EBL:** Minimal  
Consider PONV meds and steroids.

**More Notes**:  
A Mastoidectomy is sometimes performed as part of other procedures, such as cochlear implant or facial nerve decompression.

**There are several different types of Mastoidectomy:**

**Simple (or closed) Mastoidectomy-** From behind the ear, the surgeon opens the mastoid bone and removes the infected air cells. The eardrum is incised to drain the middle ear.

**Radical Mastoidectomy -** Removal of posterior and superior canal wall, meatoplasty and exteriorization of the middle ear.

**Canal Wall Down or CWD Mastoidectomy -** Removal of posterior and superior canal wall with a meatoplasty. The ear canal and mastoid are one cavity. The tympanic membrane is left in place.

**Canal Wall Up or CWU Mastoidectomy:** Posterior and superior canal wall are kept intact. A facial recess approach is taken.

**Cortical Mastoidectomy** (Also known as the Schwartze procedure) - Removal of Mastoid air cells is undertaken without affecting the middle ear. This is typically done for mastoiditis.

**Modified Radical Mastoidectomy -** Some middle ear bones are left in place and the eardrum is rebuilt by tympanoplasty.
