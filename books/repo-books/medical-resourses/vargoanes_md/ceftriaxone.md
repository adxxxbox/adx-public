### Ceftriaxone

**Ceftriaxone (Rocephin)**  
3rd Generation Cephalosporin  
Semisynthetic and broad-spectrum  
A Beta-Lactam Antibiotic, so avoid with beta lactam allergy.  
Penicillins and Cephalosporins are Beta-Lactams.  
**Doses:**  
The usual adult daily dose is 1 to 2 grams.  
**Popular dose:** 1 gram IV over 30 minutes.  
To be started within 60 minutes prior to incision.

**MOA:**  
Same mode of action as other beta-lactam antibiotics: disrupt the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls.  
**Incompatibilities**  
Vancomycin, amsacrine, aminoglycosides, and fluconazole are physically incompatible with ceftriaxone in admixtures.
