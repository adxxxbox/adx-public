### Tonsillectomy and Adenoidectomy (T & A) Anesthesia for Adults

Tonsillectomy is defined as the surgical excision of the palatine tonsils.  
T & A –removing the palatine tonsils and the adenoid.  
  
This is a very common procedure in pediatrics- less common with adults.  
There are many variations in how to manage these procedures among practitioners.  
Below is a basic method since there is no ONE standard practice.  
  
**Most Popular Indications:**  
Airway obstruction  
Recurrent throat infections  
  
**Your goal for this case is to:**  
Keep the patient motionless.  
Avoid hypertension to help limit bleeding.  
Safely manage the airway, which is prone to laryngospasm.  
Avoid airway fire (low FIO2)  
Avoid PONV and post-op pain as much as possible.  
  
**Pre-op evaluation:**  
**Labs:** Typically, CBC, platelet level, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and bleeding time.  
  
**Contraindications of Tonsillectomy:  
**Anemia Hb <10g  
Acute infection  
Abnormal coags  
Bleeding diathesis; leukemia, purpura, aplastic anemia, hemophilia  
Overt or submucous cleft palate  
Children < 3 years  
Uncontrolled systemic disease  
During menstruation  
**Anesthesia:** General/ETT -preferably a cuffed oral rae.  
Also, the surgeon will pack the supraglottic area to prevent spillage of blood to the stomach and trachea.  
**FIO2:** Lower it to < 30% when using electrocautery or laser.  
Many surgical methods are utilized to remove tonsils that are of little risk.  
Always check with the surgeon.  
**Intubation:** Secure the ETT to midline without a lot of tape because the EENT surgeon will reposition it as needed.  
  
Most surgeons request a head drape and two blue surgical towels opened all the way and placed lengthwise under the patient's head.  
A top towel is then wrapped around the patient’s head like a turban covering the eyes and secured with a clip or tape.  
**Ventilation:** Controlled or spontaneous.  
Most anesthesia providers will allow the patient to return to spontaneous ventilation ASAP and then switch to PSV Pro to assist breathing.  
It is not common to wait until the last second to breathe back the patient because the EENT usually expects a fast turnover.  
Titrate narcotics with the respiratory rate.  
  
**Muscle Relaxant:** A low-dose intermediate-acting muscle relaxant or succinylcholine.  
**Narcotics:** Minimal to avoid PONV  
**Dexmedetomidine:** Yes, it enhances a smooth emergence.  
**Decadron:** 8-12 mg (ask the surgeon)  
**Antibiotics:** Yes  
**Antiemetics:** PONV is common following a tonsillectomy from blood in the stomach.  
**Zofran** 4mg IV has been the gold standard  
  
**Duration: Tonsillectomy:** 15-45 minutes**Adenotonsillectomy:** 45-90 minutes  
**Antibiotics:** Yes  
  
**Positioning:** Rose Position  
**Rose Position:** Supine with head extended by placing a pillow or shoulder roll under the shoulders.  
  
**Rotate the bed 45% for the surgeon.**  
The bed is usually rotated 45 degrees for the surgeon after the airway is secure.  
Ensure your IV and other tubing have slack and are away from the surgeon’s field.  
  
After the surgeon is comfortable with the position on the bed, a mouth clamp is applied to pry the patient’s mouth wide open (usually a Boyle-Davis gag).  
The gag device can be very stimulating, and we usually crank up the sevoflurane just before or during this application.  
Do not chase the stress response with narcotics.  
  
**Packing of the supraglottic area (throat pack):  
**The surgeon usually announces when the packing is applied.  
The most crucial part is making sure the packing is removed before emergence.  
Most of us document when the packing is initially applied and removed; however, it is not mandatory.  
NEVER emerge and extubate your patient until you know the packing has been removed!  
  
**The rationale for intraoperative steroids (decadron):  
**Mood elevation-post op  
Appetite stimulation-post op  
Anti-inflammatory-less swelling  
Antiemetic  
Decadron study –shows it decreases post-op pain.  
  
**Decadron half-life:** 36-72 hours  
  
**During the procedure:  
**While the surgeon is removing the tonsils, this is the time for you to prepare for the following procedure (if there is one).  
Ensure your alarm volume is adequate on your monitor so you won’t miss a beat if your back is turned away from the patient.  
  
The surgeon will usually give you a warning before the procedure is complete.  
The patient should already be spontaneously breathing.  
  
**Hand the surgeon an NG Tube:  
**After the surgeon removes the throat pack and BEFORE the Boyle-Davis gag device is removed, we commonly hand an NG tube for the surgeon to insert and suction out the stomach.  
They usually use their own suction tubing.  
  
**Boyle–Davis gag device is removed (mouth retractor):**  
When the surgeon removes the Boyle –Davis gag device, you or someone else will rotate the bed back to the original position for you to have complete access to the airway.  
Only emerge the patient with easy access to the airway.  
  
**Emergence:  
**Remember, a tiny drop of blood tickling the vocal cords while going through the excitatory state (emergence) could induce a laryngospasm.  
  
While the patient is still deep, gently suction the oropharynx to assure a dry airway.  
Make sure you do not damage or irritate the tonsillar bed in the process.  
  
**Extubate your patient:  
**Some deep, some awake?  
Make sure you have a patent airway before leaving the OR.  
Most of us insert an oral airway if the extubation is deep.  
  
**Emergency Equipment:**  
Many anesthesia providers bring a syringe of succinylcholine with them to the recovery room in case of a laryngospasm occurs  
  
**Possible Complications:  
**Primary hemorrhage  
Post op- hemorrhage: 0.1-8.1%  
Injury to tongue  
Trauma to anterior and posterior pillars  
Damaged uvula, soft palate, superior or constrictor muscle  
Injury to teeth and gums -from the gag device  
Aspiration  
Facial edemaJaw joint discomfort or clicking from the gag device  
Emesis- irritant blood in the stomach  
Gagging-(inflammation/edema)  
Dehydration  
**Airway fire risk:** Highest when electrocautery or laser methods are utilized.  
In other methods with a very low fire risk, lowering the FIO2 to 30% is unnecessary.  
**  
Delayed complications:**  
**Infections** \- usually a week after the surgery.  
**Bleeding** during this period is known as secondary hemorrhage.Coblation method tonsillectomy: 11.1%-bleed  
Lung complications  
Scaring of soft palate and pillars  
Tonsillar remnants  
Hypertrophy of lingual tonsil  
Aspiration of food  
Facial edema  
  
Trauma to the posterior pillar causes nasal regurgitation whenever the patient attempts to drink fluids after surgery.  
It may also cause undesirable changes in the voice - Rhinolalia aperta.  
**Origin of bleeding:**  
Tonsillar fossa-67%  
Nsopharynx-26%  
both-7%  
**  
More Notes:**  
PONV delays drinking fluids and increases the risk of dehydration.  
  
In the PACU, ice chips and fluid are offered once the patient is conscious and reflexes have returned.  
It is controversial whether fluids should be lukewarm or cold.  
  
There may be an increased throat discomfort between postoperative days 4 and 8 due to the separation of eschar from the pharyngeal bed.  
  
Delayed bleeding can occur 7 to 10 days post-procedure.
