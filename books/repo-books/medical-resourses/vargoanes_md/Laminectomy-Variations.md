### Laminectomy/Laminotomy/Laminoplasty

A **laminectomy** is frequently confused with a **laminotomy**, which is only the partial removal of the lamina and attached ligaments. The surgical removal of part or all of the posterior vertebral elements to allow space for the neural structures.  
Laminectomies and laminotomies are often performed in the course of a number of operations on the spinal canal, such as a discectomy.

A laminectomy can be combined with a foraminotomy procedure. During a foraminotomy, the bony canal through which the nerves pass as they leave the spinal cord is widened. The foraminotomy, like the laminectomy procedure, relieves pressure on the nerves.

**Laminoplasty:**  
The surgical reconstruction of the posterior vertebral elements to increase space for the neural structures while maintaining the posterior arch.

**Laminotomy:**  
An opening made in a lamina. It is the formation of a hole in the lamina without disrupting the continuity of the entire lamina to approach the intervertebral disc or neural structures.
