### Epidural Dosing Goal

To administer the proper epidural dose that offers adequate analgesia while preserving motor (pushing) power for a vaginal delivery.  
  
If the patient loses motor function required for pushing, she may require emergency C-section.  
  
Newer OB regional epidural continuous infusions use the combinations of lower concentrations of local anesthetics and lower doses of opioids to offer adequate analgesia while maintaining motor (pushing) power. The spontaneous delivery rate utilizing these combinations is high.  
  
The patient must be able to push during the second stage of labor.
