### Heart Transplant Patient for Noncardiac Surgery

Find out how along ago the patient received their heart transplant. There is existing literature about nerve re-enervation to the transplanted heart –especially after 15 years.  
Unpredictable re-enervation may occur after heart transplantation. 

**Anesthetic Goal:**  
Avoid significant vasodilation  
Avoid acute decreases in preload  
Avoid Bradycardia  
Avoid Infection

**_The denervated heart can respond ONLY by increasing stroke volume, not heart rate. Recipients are thus “preload dependent” and must have adequate central volume to meet the demands of stress and of anesthetic techniques that redistribute vascular volume to the periphery_****_._**

**Transplanted heart patients have:**  
An increased SVR  
Increased HR  
Are dependent upon venous return for CO because the HR is usually at a fixed rate.

**Inotropes and Drugs that WILL work on a denervated heart**  
Isuprel-Increases contractility and HR  
Epinephrine: (0.03-0.3 mcg/kg/min) Also increases HR  
Milrinone (0.375-0.75mcg/kg/min)  
Dopamine: (2-10mcg/kg/min)-Weakest of the 4 Inotropes

Ephedrine: Works, but has a blunted affect.  
Norepinephrine: Works like Epinephrine  
Propanolol: Decreases HR and contractility

Neostigmine: Can cause severe bradycardia (rare)-many avoid  
Dobutamine (2.5-20mcg/kg/min) can also increase HR.

**For Bradycardia:**  
Treat first with Isuprel (diluted in a syringe); if Isuprel does not work, the BP will have already dropped. Push 10-20mcg of Epinephrine.  
   
**For Hypotension not related to Bradycardia:**  
Vasopressin 1-2 units; it does NOT increase PVR.  
Give Neosynephrine, then give Epinephrine if needed.  0.5-1 gm CaCl also works.  
  
**Regional:** General anesthesia is usually selected over a SAB or epidural. There may be an impaired response to the hypotension associated with spinal or epidural anesthesia. There is still literature about it being done safely.

**Pre-op:** All preoperative drug therapy must be continued, and proper functioning of a cardiac pacemaker must be confirmed.

**Induction:** Etomidate  
**Intubation:** Oral over nasal because the nasal flora can cause an infection. There is no or little sympathetic response to direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.  
**Inhalation Agent:** Avoid Nitrous Oxide, it can increase PVR.  
Our common inhaled agents have well known myocardial depressant properties, but are still well tolerated unless there is significant heart failure. The patient will NOT have a sympathetic reaction if you let them “get light”.

**Muscle relaxant:** Use minimally; only when necessary.  Nimbex has the least histamine release. Some still use vecuronium. Pancuronium has no hemodynamic effects on the denervated heart, although it has normal systemic effects.

**Muscle Relaxant Reversal:**  
Bradycardia and asystole (DEATH) after Neostigmine have been reported in adult cardiac transplants of less than 6 months or greater than 6 months from surgery.  
Also consider Edrophonium instead of Neostigmine. With Edrophonium, the decrease in heart rate is smaller in magnitude and much more consistent compared with neostigmine.

**Some of us use NO reversal and let them fully wake up on the ventilator in recover room.**

**Heart Rate:** Maintain it. A denervated heart’s rate is about 110 bpm, which reflects the absence of normal vagal tone. These patients are volume dependent.  
Atropine and Robinul WILL NOT increase HR. That is why we use Isuprel or Ephedrine.   
Many of these patients have a pacer.  
  
**Hydration:** Keep full. The denervated heart is unable to increase HR immediately in response to hypovolemia or hypotension.  The needed increase in cardiac output is dependent on venous return until the heart rate increases after several minutes in response to the effect of circulating catecholamines.  
  
**IV Access:** Use aseptic technique because of the increased susceptibility to infection. Remember-they are immunosuppressed.  
Central Line: Not indicated unless you feel your case will involve large volume shifts, frequent blood draws, or something else.

**Preload:** Maintain. These patients are preload dependent and the denervated heart is unable to respond to sudden shifts in blood volume with an increase in heart rate. Avoid hypovolemia or hypotension. They both decrease preload.  
 

**EKG:** You may have 2 P waves: this is normal. First-degree AV Block is common after cardiac transplantation. Some patients will have Pacers to maintain a high rate.  
  
**Should you use Robinul or Atropine with Reversal?**  
It’s well documented that Vagolytic drugs like Atropine and Robinul fail to increase the HR. However, many still co-administer one with an anticholinesterase when reversing.  
Have Isoproteronol (Isuprel) and Epinephrine drawn up and available.

**Extubation:** ASAP! Less chance of pneumonia.  
You should also use sterile gloves when you suction out the ETT prior to emergence.  
Remember: These patients are on immunosuppressants.

**SVT or Tachycardia:**  
Carotid sinus massage and the Valsalva maneuver have no effect on the HR. Use Propanolol.
