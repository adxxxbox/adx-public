Ectropion Repair     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Ectropion Repair

Usually involves the lower lid and usually occurs concurrently with horizontal lid laxity. The lower lid turns out so that the inner surface is chronically exposed. The correction depends on the type and severity of the deformity.

**Anesthetic:** MAC or General/LMA; it often depends on patient compliance.  
**Duration:** 30-75 minutes.  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 22G is acceptable. A 500mL NS bag with micro drip tubing is popular.  
**Position:** Supine with arms tucked and the patient remains on the same stretcher.  
Make sure the ETCO2 NC is looped away from the surgical eye. The stretcher is parked 90-180 degrees away from you (unless you are starting out as a general).
