Clopidogrel (Plavix, Duoplavin) reversal    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Clopidogrel (Plavix, Duoplavin) reversal

_Currently, there is a lack of specific antidotes for the growing number of new (novel) anticoagulants that are slowly replacing warfarin and heparin. For this reason, there is NO universal standard of care for the treatment of the anticoagulated bleeding patient when there is no specific antidote._

**Consult cardiology for ALL patients with coronary stents.**

**Premature cessation of dual anti‐platelet therapy with stents can be fatal.** Discontinuation of Plavix and aspirin due to a bleeding event must be weighed against the patient’s risk of arterial thrombosis.  
High risk of thrombosis within 1 month of receiving a bare metal coronary stent and within 3 months of receiving a drug eluting coronary stent.  
A stent thrombosis can potentially be fatal.  
  
**Quick Notes** Clopidogrel is irreversible platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor.  
**Elimination T1/2:** 6 hours (30 minutes for active metabolite).  
Clopidogrel is usually co-administered with aspirin for patients with stents.  
_Irreversible antiplatelet drug that inhibits platelet function for the lifetime of the platelets.  
_Patient should be off clopidogrel for 7 days prior to surgery.  
The more recent the Plavix dose, the less effective platelet transfusion.  
Inhibition takes 7-10 days to resolve as new platelets are generated.  
  
**Reversal methods will be similar to other P2Y12 receptor inhibitors:**  
Ticlopidine  
Prasugrel  
Ticagrelor  
  
**Specific antidote:** None.  
  
**Non-urgent**  
Discontinue 5-10 days prior to surgery.  
Cardiology consult.**  
  
Urgent (not bleeding): options vary among institutional protocols.**  
Discontinue and determine time of the last dose.  
Cardiology or hematology consult.**Evaluate platelet function:** Platelet function assay.  
Tranexamic acid - 1 gram.  
Desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg x 1 ( _Warning: DDAVP can lead to arterial vasospasm_ ).  
Consider platelet transfusion (1 unit) if > 40% inhibited prior to high risk bleeding procedures.  
  
**Minor bleeding: options vary among institutional protocols.  
**Cardiology or hematology consult.  
  
**Evaluate platelet function:** Platelet function assay  
Tranexamic acid - 1 gram  
Desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg x 1 ( _Warning: DDAVP can lead to arterial vasospasm_ ).  
1 unit of platelets if > 40% inhibited as per platelet function assay (PFA).Recheck PFA 1 hour after platelet transfusion complete.  
  
**Prior to high risk bleeding procedures:**  
Consider platelet transfusion (1 unit) if > 40% platelet inhibited prior to high risk bleeding procedures.  
Recheck PFA 1 hour after platelet transfusion complete.  
  
**Severe Bleed: options vary among institutional protocols.  
**Cardiology or hematology consult.  
Tranexamic acid - 1 gram.  
  
**Evaluate platelet function:** Agent-specific Plavix and/or aspirin platelet function assay.  
Desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg x 1 ( _Warning: DDAVP can lead to arterial vasospasm_ ).  
For known history of aspirin and clopidogrel: check baseline platelet function assay (PFA) and  
administer 1 unit of pheresis platelets (1 unit = 6-10 pack) x 1 stat.  
Re-check PFA 1 hour after platelet transfusion complete.  
  
**Life-threatening  
**Transfuse more platelets.  
Initiate massive transfusion protocols.  
FEIBA 8 to 25 units/kg or Kcentra can be considered.  
  
**_Warning:_** _Thrombotic and thromboembolic events may occur with high doses of PCCs and may result in death. Patients need to be monitored following administration._
