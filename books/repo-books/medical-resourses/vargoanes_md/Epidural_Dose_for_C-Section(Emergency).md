### Epidural Dose for C-Section(Emergency)

_For true emergency C-sections, we intubate and go to sleep._  
_If you don’t have time to wait for a safely dosed epidural, then go to sleep!_  
  
For true emergency C-section, induce general anesthesia and intubate.  
If there is no time to wait for a safely dosed epidural, then induce general anesthesia.  
  
Most providers draw up **20 mL of plain 2% lidocaine.** The second most popular choice is 20 mL of **3% Chloroprocaine.**  
  
If the patient has some type of preexisting block from their PCEA, sometimes it only takes 10-15 mL. Always bolus in 5 mL increments and re-assess Q 5 minutes.  
  
There is a fine line between an emergency C-section and urgent C-section. There are some complications of labor that allow insufficient time to draw up agents, bolus an epidural, and possibly wait a few minutes for the block to set in.  
  
It is a lot more convenient to intubate an emergency C-section patient just prior to incision than to intubate during the middle of the case.

According to literature, 20 mL of 3% Chloroprocaine with 2 mEq of NaHCO3 may be the combination of drugs to dose an epidural for fastest onset. There is insufficient time to draw up NaHCO 3 and mix it with local anesthetic during an emergency.  
  
20 mL of 3% chloroprocaine or 2% Lidocaine can be injected incrementally 5cc per boluses beginning in the patient’s room prior to transport to OR.  
  
**When do I start bolusing?** In the patient’s room, after the decision is made to proceed to urgent C-section, prior to transport to the Operating Room.  
  
You may also bolus enroute to surgery with the patient.  
_(Note: the practice of blousing an epidural in a patient for whom monitoring is not being simultaneously carried out may be judged as not meeting the standard of care.)_**  
  
Why Not Just Bolus 20 ml?  
**It is too risky to just bolus 20 mL s and possibly produce an unacceptably extensive block, leading to an emergency C-section and unstable fetus. Depending on your patient’s established block from their PCEA, it may take only 10 mL for an adequate T4 (nipple) level block.  
You still need to follow epidural safety dosing standards with incremental 5 mL boluses.  
  
**How much time should I wait between 5 mL boluses?  
**Literature clearly states 5 minutes. Some experienced providers have pushed it to 3 minutes followed with reassessment. “Every epidural dose is a test dose.”There is a fine line between an emergency C-section and urgent C-section. There are some complications of labor that do not allow time to draw up medications, bolus an epidural, and wait for the onset of block.  
There are also some labor complications during which it is undesirable to allow a patient to remain conscious and out of control, possibly disrupting care during a stressful event.  
  
_It is much easier to intubate, secure the airway, focus on starting extra IVs, stabilizing the mother/hemodynamics and administering blood._  
  
It is a lot more convenient to intubate an emergency C-section patient just prior to incision than to intubate during the middle of the case.  
  
**Realistically, who mixes NaHCO3 with a Local Anesthetic for a faster onset?  
**According to some literature, 20mL of 3% Chloroprocaine with 2 mEq of NaHCO3 per epidural might be considered the cocktail with the fastest onset. Most providers just use plain  
3% Chloroprocaine or 0.2% lidocaine. It takes extra time to locate NaHCO3, draw it up and mix it with your local anesthetic. We simply start dosing the local anesthetic once the decision for C section has been made while the is still in the labor suite.  
  
I properly caution against a large epidural bolus of lidocaine, citing excessive block height as an adverse outcome. That is of course true, however, the issue of local anesthetic systemic toxicity due to an inadvertent intravascular injection is another concern mitigating against rapid bolus of local anesthetic.  
  
Bolusing in the patient’s room, or enroute to the OR, in a less controlled environment than the OR, goes beyond analgesia and represents the **_induction of anesthesia outside the OR._** I have seen it done on many occasions. however, many who write policy and procedures manual would not put such practices into writing.
