# Prilocaine

**Prilocaine (Citanest)** Mostly used for dental  
**Class:** Amide type Local Anesthetic  
**Duration:**Intermediate but longer than Lidocaine.  
**EMLA cream:** Lidocaine and Prilocaine are combined in a topical formulation.  
**Warning:** Reports of significant methemoglobinemia (20-30%) in infants and children following excessive applications of EMLA cream.  
These cases involved the use of large dosages, larger than recommended areas of application, or occurred in infants < 3 months.  
  
**Treatment:** 1-2mg/kg Methylene Blue IV, max 7-8mg/kg.  
Prilocaine is metabolized to orthotoluidine (oxidating compound) that can convert hemoglobin to methemoglobin.  
Causes less vasodilation than most other local anesthetics thus not requiring epinephrine.  
**Doses:**  
\> 600mg may be a sufficient methemoglobin present (3-5g/dL) to decrease O2 carrying capacity and cyanosis.  
**Infiltration 0.5-1%**  
**Onset:** Fast  
**Duration:** 60-120 mins  
**Max Dose:** 600mg  
**Peripheral Nerve Block 1.5 - 2%**  
**Onset:** Fast  
**Duration:** 90-180 mins  
**Max Dose:** 600mg  
**Epidural** 2-3%  
**Onset:** Fast  
**Duration:** 60-180 mins  
**Max Dose:** 600mg  
  
**MOA:** Like other local anesthetics, it binds to the intracellular portion of sodium channels and blocks sodium influx into nerve cells, which prevents depolarization.  
  
**In Detail:** Prevents transmission of nerve impulses by inhibiting the passage of Na ions through their specific channels. It is speculated that local anesthetics bind to specific sites on the inner portion of the Na channels (internal gate or H gate) near their external openings to maintain those channels in an inactivated state.  
**Metabolized:** Liver and Kidneys  
**Excreted:** Kidneys  
**CNS and Cardiac Manifestations to watch for:**  
Euphoria  
Dizziness  
Tinnitus  
Twitching  
Tremors  
Convulsions  
Hypotension  
Cardiac Arrest  
**Contraindications:** congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia.
