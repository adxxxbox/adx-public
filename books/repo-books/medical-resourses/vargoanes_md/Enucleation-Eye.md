### Enucleation-Eye

This is the surgical removal of the eye. The eye muscles and remaining orbital contents remain intact. Enucleation is performed to remove large-sized eye tumors or as a result of traumatic injury when the eye cannot be preserved. A prosthesis is sometimes placed too.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT (oral Rae): it’s OK to use Anectine. LMA is rare.  
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 22G is acceptable. A 500mL NS bag with micro drip tubing is popular.  
**Position:** Supine with arms tucked.
