### Antithrombin III (AT3) Deficiency

A thrombotic disorder.  
AT3 deficiency is a rare inherited hypercoagulable disorder which predisposes patients to thrombotic complications.  
Anticoagulants are necessary to prevent recurrent thrombosis.  
AT3 inhibits coagulation by neutralizing thrombin (factors IIa, IXa, Xa).  
  
**Antithrombin III levels  
Newborn:** 60%-90%  
**Children and adults:** 80%-120%  
**Plasma concentration:** 0.15-0.2 mg/mL  
**Perioperative concerns with Antithrombin III deficiency  
**Venous thrombosis  
Massive thromboembolism may occur when AT3 levels < 50.  
Pulmonary embolism, or DVT with immobility.  
Thrombus formation in indwelling catheter.  
Mesenteric, inferior vena cava or CNS thrombosis.  
Decreases sensitivity to heparin (heparin resistance).  
Timing of neuraxial anesthesia in anticoagulated patients.  
Withdrawal of warfarin preoperatively, patients may be heparin resistant.  
  
**Incidence:** 1/2,000 – 1/5,000  
Men and women equally affected.  
No racial difference  
  
AT3 is produced in the liver.   
The half-life of AT3 is approximately 2.8 to 4.8 days.  
Healthy newborns have approximately 50% AT3 activity; this reaches adult levels by approximately six months of age.  
**Diagnosis of antithrombin III deficiency  
Cannot be assessed by prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), or thrombin time (TT).  
**Diagnostic testing  
Antithrombin assays  
Protein C (antigen and activity tests) and protein S (total and free tests).  
Factor V Leiden testing  
Homocysteine level  
Anticardiolipin antibodies (immunoglobulin G \[IgG\] and IgM class).  
**Treatment:** Antithrombin III concentrate or fresh frozen plasma.  
Warfarin is commonly administered to keep INR between 1.5-2.5 to prevent thrombosis.  
  
**Antithrombin III** **deficiency can be:** inherited or acquired.  
**Inherited deficiencies:** Due to Antithrombin III gene mutations.  
  
**Acquired may result from:  
Impaired production of functional** **Antithrombin III** (Liver disease, warfarin or asparaginase (chemotherapy)  
**Loss of** **Antithrombin III (** Nephrotic syndrome (urinary losses), ECMO and hemofiltration)  
**Accelerated consumption** (acute thrombosis or DIC)  
  
**Medication acquired**  
Heparins can lower Antithrombin III activity by 30%, but not considered a thrombotic risk.  
Oral contraceptives may reduce Antithrombin III levels.  
  
**Heparin** may give a false impression of AT deficiency.  
**Direct factor Xa inhibitors** (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) can lead to an overestimation of Antithrombin III activity in a factor Xa-based functional assay.  
This results in a false impression that the patient with Antithrombin III deficiency has normal Antithrombin III levels.  
  
**Direct thrombin inhibitors** (argatroban, dabigatran) can lead to an overestimation of Antithrombin III activity in a thrombin-based assay.  
This also may lead to a false impression that the patient with Antithrombin III deficiency has normal Antithrombin III levels.  
**Warfarin**  may sometimes raise Antithrombin III activity, leading to the false impression that a patient with Antithrombin III deficiency has normal AT levels.  
  
**Inherited:**  
**Congenital conditions discussed with antithrombin III deficiency  
Homozygous antithrombin III deficiency:** Discovered in neonates-severe  
**Heterozygous antithrombin III deficiency:** Discovered in patients with their first thrombosis.  
  
**Homozygous antithrombin III deficiency** (more severe)  
Individual inherits two defective genes, thus it is a rare autosomal recessive condition.  
Involves neonates with _AT3_  homozygous mutations.  
Increased arterial and venous thrombosis is noted in the neonatal period or early infancy.  
This condition is rarely compatible with life.  
In neonates with homozygous _AT3,_  arterial and venous thrombosis are seen, particularly with invasive vascular procedures.  
Replacement of antithrombin III using antithrombin III concentrates or fresh frozen plasma is recommended preoperatively.  
  
**Heterozygous congenital or acquired antithrombin III deficiency**  
May result in venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism with an onset in young adulthood. This form is most commonly diagnosed during childhood by screening after an affected family member has been identified or after a child has had a thrombotic event.The duration of warfarin therapy in children with acquired or heterozygous congenital antithrombin III deficiency experiencing their first clot is controversial, but therapy is generally continued for at least 3-6 months before cessation of anticoagulation. If the underlying triggering event cannot be removed, indefinite anticoagulation should be considered.  
  
**Once thrombosis is present  
**When a congenital antithrombin III deficiency has developed thrombosis, anticoagulation is more strongly indicated. Replacement with recombinant antithrombin is not indicated for the treatment of thrombi.  
  
Antithrombin III deficiency may result in venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism when an affected family member or after a child has had a thrombotic event.  
**Congenital antithrombin III deficiency**  
An autosomal dominant disorder in which an individual inherits one copy of the  _SERPINC1_  (also called  _AT3_ ) gene on chromosome 1q25.1, which encodes antithrombin III.  
  
_The gene for antithrombin is located on the first chromosome (1q23-_ 25).  
**Treatment:** Antithrombin III concentrates or fresh frozen plasma.  
The activity of LMWH is not as reliable in these patients.  
Warfarin (Coumadin) is the principal anticoagulant used to maintain an INR of 1.5-2.5.  
Careful monitoring of the anti-Xa activity in the patient should be performed.  
  
Initially, therapy with LMWH or standard heparin may be administered to decrease the risk of warfarin-associated thrombosis (warfarin-induced skin necrosis) resulting from the inhibition of protein C production.  
This may occur before inhibition of the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent procoagulant factors (II, VII, IX, X) is reduced adequately for anticoagulation.  
  
**Imaging studies that can be used in the evaluation of antithrombin III deficiency include the following:  
Echocardiography:**  For evidence of arterial thrombus  
**Doppler ultrasonography** : For acute thrombosis in extremities  
**Ventilation-perfusion scanning:**  To check for pulmonary thrombosis.  
  
**Antithrombin III and Anesthesia  
**Hematology consult.  
Patient with ATIII deficiency who received human-derived ATIII concentrate as part of a perioperative anticoagulant regimen, had no issues with neuraxial anesthesia.
