### Multiplate Platelet Assay

Multiplate Platelet analyzer uses impedance aggregometry method that based on the principle that blood platelets are non-thrombogenic in their resting state, but expose receptors on their surface when they become activated which allows them to attach on vascular injuries and artificial surfaces.  
  
**The Multiplate detects the effects of the platelet inhibitors:**  
Aspirin  
Clopidogrel  
GpIIb/IIIa antagonists  
Also the sensitivity for direct ADP receptor antagonists has been shown.  
  
**Disadvantages of Multiplate Platelet Assay  
**More dependent on Ca levels compared to other platelet assays.  
Citrated blood sampling tubes affect free Ca levels, so hiruden coated tubes are preferred.  
When you view an interpretation table, it may read “hiruden blood sample,” meaning a hiruden coated tube was used.  
For APSI test, patient must have a platelet count of at least 150k.  
ADP and COL tests need at least 100k platelet count.  
TRAP test needs only a 50K platelet count  
Requires pipetting  
  
**Advantages of Multiplate Platelet Assay**  
Rapid results < 10 minute  
Low sample volume (0.3mL per test)  
Multiple platelet agonist available.  
  
**Multiplate Platelet Test Assays:**  
ADP test  
ASPI test  
COL test  
TRAP test  
  
**Measuring Parameters  
AUC** (area under the curve)  
**U:** (aggregated unit)  
  
**ADPtest:  
**ADP stimulates platelet activation by the ADP receptors. The most important ADP receptor (P2Y12) is blocked by clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticlopidine. The addition of the endogenous inhibitor PGE1 makes ADPtest HS more sensitive towards the effects of clopidogrel and related drugs compared to ADPtest.  
  
**ASPItest:  
**Activation by arachidonic acid, the substrate of the cyclooxygenase (COX). COX forms Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) which is a potent platelet agonist.  
  
**COLtest:  
**Collagen activates the collagen receptor, which leads to a release of endogenous arachidonic acid, which is converted to TXA2 and activates the platelet.  
  
**TRAPtest:  
**TRAP-6 stimulates the thrombin receptor on the platelet surface. Thrombin is a very potent platelet activator. Its action is not blocked by aspirin or clopidogrel. TRAPtest allows to detect GPIIb/IIIa antagonists also in samples treated by Aspirin or clopidogrel.
