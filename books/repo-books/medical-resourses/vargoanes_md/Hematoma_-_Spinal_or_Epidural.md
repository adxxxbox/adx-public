### Hematoma - Spinal or Epidural

  
_Daniel D. Moos, CRNA_

Trauma during neuraxial techniques to epidural veins is usually benign and self-limiting.  
Incidence of neuraxial hematoma formation for epidurals is 1:150,000-220,000.  
  
**Risk factors for developing** **a spinal or epidural hematoma:  
**Anticoagulants  
Disease processes that affect coagulation  
Multiple attempts during neuraxial blockade  
Formation of a hematoma after epidural catheter removal.  
  
Bleeding in the subarachnoid/epidural space will result in the compression of neural tissue. Due to anatomical factors, it is not possible to apply pressure to compress the blood vessels and stop the bleeding. Compression of neuraxial structures result in ischemia and subsequent injury.  
**The onset of symptoms is generally rapid and include the following** :  
Sharp back and leg pain  
Progression of numbness  
Progression in motor weakness  
Sphincter dysfunction  
  
Rapid diagnosis is essential.  
An MRI or CT scan can identify an epidural or spinal hematoma.  
Surgical decompression should occur within 4-6 hours of onset to avoid permanent injury.
