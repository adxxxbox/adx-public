Dalteparin (Fragmin)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Dalteparin (Fragmin)

A low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)  
LMWH drugs - all end in “parin”  
Dalteparin, like other LMWHs is about 1/3 the size of unfractionated heparin (UFH).  
**  
Dalteparin is 1 of 3 LMWHs currently available in the US.**  
Enoxaparin (Lovenox)  
Dalteparin (Fragmin)  
Tinzaparin (Innohep)  
  
**Indications:**  
Prophylaxis for VTE **–** low Doses  
Dalteparin is used as a prophylaxis for deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms in patients undergoing general surgery.  
  
**Method of Action:**  
Enhances the inhibition of Factor Xa.  
Factor Xa is important for conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.  
Dalteparin and other LMWH are too small to inactivate Thrombin and only has anti-factor Xa activity.  
  
**Doses:**  
**Prophylactic DVT doses:** 5,000 SQ units/day.  
**Full Systemic Anticoagulation:** 200 units/kg SQ Q day or 100 units/kg SQ BID.  
  
**Route:** Subcutaneous administration.  
  
**Monitor:** Usually not monitored, but may check **Anti-XA** levels if needed.  
  
Only slightly affecting the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).  
  
**Example:** Subcutaneous administration of doses of 5,000 IU twice daily of FRAGMIN for seven consecutive days did not markedly affect **aPTT.**  
**aPTT:** Only slightly affected.  
  
**AntiXa Activity (LMWH)**  
If measuring is desired, check peak antiXa level 3-4 hours after dose.  
Observed peak AntiXa levels for Q12h dosing of LMWHs = 0.5-1 units/mL.  
Observed peak antiXa levels for Q24h dosing of LMWHs = 1-2 units per mL.  
You can also check trough antiXa levels prior to the next dose = <0.5 units/mL.  
Elevated troughs suggest impaired clearance.  
  
**LMWH Therapeutic Ranges (target anti-Xa levels measured 4 hours after dosing):**  
**Dalteparin (Fragmin):**  
Therapeutic qD dosing 1.05.  
  
**Enoxaparin (Lovenox)**  
Therapeutic bid dosing 0.6-1.0.  
Therapeutic qD dosing >1.0.  
  
**Tinzaparin (Innohep):**  
Therapeutic qD dosing 0.85.

| Anticoagulant | Mean Molecular Mass | Anti FXa/FIIa

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UFH | 15 kDa | 193/193 | 1 |
| Tinzaprin (Innohep) | 6.8 kDa | 90/45 | 2.0 |

| Fondaparinux (Arixtra)  
See note below. | 1.7 kDa | 930/0 |  |

**Note - Fondaparinux (Arixtra)** is an anticoagulant that shares the same pentasaccharide sequence as UFH and LMWH for the binding to antithrombin, however it has no extra chain and thus, is not considered a heparin product. It is also known to not cause HIT, as seen with UFH and LMWH.

  
**Indications:  
**Prophylaxis for VTE **– low Doses  
**Dalteparin is used as a prophylaxis for deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms in patients undergoing general surgery.  
  
**Metabolism:** Liver and the reticulo-endothelial system are the sites of biotransformation.  
**Clearance:** Excreted via kidneys. The plasma clearance rate is 33 mL/min.  
  
**T1/2:** Intravenous - 2 hours.  
Subcutaneous - 3-5 hours.  
  
**Antidote:** Protamine – see reversal section.  
  
**Full systemic anticoagulation**  
Can be used concomitantly with aspirin and/or other therapy (e.g., nitrates, β-adrenergic blockers, clopidogrel, platelet glycoprotein \[GP\] IIb/IIIa-receptor inhibitors) to reduce the risk of acute cardiac ischemic events.  
Patients with combined treatment above usually have unstable angina or non-ST-segment elevation/non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (i.e., non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes).  
It is also used in the prevention of clotting during hemodialysis and hemofiltration in connection with acute renal failure or chronic renal insufficiency.  
  
**DVT doses vs full systemic anticoagulation**  
Prophylactic DVT doses - 5,000 SQ units/day (rarely BID).  
  
_Twice-daily dosing of LMWH drugs for prophylaxis is associated with an increased risk of spinal hematoma. First dose should be administered no earlier than 24 hours postoperatively.  
__ASA:4.5.1 Anesthetic Management of the Patient Receiving LMWH._  
  
Full systemic anticoagulation: 200 units/kg SQ Q day or 100 units/kg SQ BID  
  
The wait time between the last DVT prophylaxis dose of **Dalteparin** and performing a regional block is half (12 hours) as compared to the larger doses required for full systemic anticoagulation.  
  
Low molecular weight heparins are less effective at inactivating factor IIa due to their shorter length compared to unfractionated heparin.  
  
**Dalteparin (Fragmin) for DVT Prophylaxis and Neuraxial/Deep Regional Blocks  
Daily or BID  
(** **Prophylactic DVT doses-5,000 SQ units/day)  
Doses may also be** 120 units/kg BID OR 200 units/kg daily.

**Restart medication after procedure:** ASRA recommends 6-8 postoperatively and second dose should NOT occur sooner than 24 hours after the first dose.  
For a bloody or difficult neuraxial placement, delay first dose 24 hours postoperatively.  
  
**Remove catheter after administration: ASRA** recommends 10-12 hours after the last dose of Dalteparin.
