### Patchy or One Sided Block Treatment

  
_Edited by: Jennifer Garris MS, CRNA_

Reposition the patient to enable spread of local anesthesia to unblocked area with unblocked area dependent.  
  
Rebolus epidural if needed with repositioning.  
  
Reposition catheter. If the catheter is positioned to one side, you may be able to adjust it by simply withdrawing the catheter 1-2cm (if you have enough catheter in the space).  
  
If none of these techniques has improved the block, remove the catheter and replace at another interspace if the patient consents.
