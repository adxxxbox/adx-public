**Warning:** With neonatal lungs, small changes in increased delivered volume can be a significant change in the desired volume, leading to unintended pressures and volume trauma to their lungs. Overstretching the alveoli, either by large tidal volumes or excessive inspiratory plateau pressures, may cause **volume trauma** and **barotrauma**.

Overstretching the alveoli may also cause **biotrauma**. **Biotrauma** is a systemic injury resulting from a release of various inflammatory molecules. Examples are reactive oxygen radicals and/or the translocation of bacteria, or air into the systemic circulation to invoke a systemic inflammatory response.

Neonates, especially certain sick premies that need aggressive ventilation, are more prone to ventilator associated lung injury/pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement and perhaps oscillating jet ventilation.

**Pressure Control Ventilation Mode:  
**Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is the major factor to determine tidal volume.With this mode, the peak inspiratory pressure parameter is set to get the tidal volume. Increasing the PIP results in higher tidal volume.

**Volume Control Ventilation:  
**Volume Control Ventilation means the ventilator is programmed to deliver a preset tidal volume of oxygen and air regardless of the amount of pressure required to deliver the volume. For example, when setting a volume of 300mLs, the ventilator will deliver 300 mLs regardless of the peak pressure required to do so, unless the safety pressure alarm discontinues the breath. The pressure limit alarm must be set appropriately.

**For Volume Control Ventilation, Adjust the Pressure Limit Alarm:  
**There is a safety pressure limiting alarm that protects the patients from receiving dangerously high pressures when the lungs increase in resistance or decrease in compliance.

For example, to set a tidal volume for a 30kg patient at 10mLs/kg, you will enter 300mLs on the tidal volume setting on the ventilator. The ventilator will deliver the 300mLs of tidal volume regardless of the lung status or PIP. Ventilators have a pressure monitor, pressure alarm, and display a digital reading of each breath so that the PIP and volume can be monitored. Set the pressure limit alarm to 5-10cmH2O above the current peak pressures. Example: if the PIP was 22cmH20 to deliver 300mLs, set the pressure limit alarm to 27-32cmH20.  
  
The PIP pressure limit alarm limits the volume delivered once the PIP limit is achieved. For example, when the PIP limit alarm is set at 30cmH2 O, once the pressure limit is achieved, no further volume is delivered. If the patient’s lungs status changes, either by an increasing resistance or a decreasing compliance, the ventilator will stop delivering the 300mL TV when the patient’s peak pressure reaches 30cmH20 on any given breath. The ventilator will audibly alarm and flash to inform you this happened.

**Initial ventilator settings after intubation:**  
Some experienced pediatric anesthesia providers start out with certain PCV parameters on the low side that do not initially appear adequate. They are just being safe and immediately adjust their settings accordingly with the rise in chest excursion and ETCO2.  
  
**Ultimate Goal of Ventilating and Oxygenating:  
**Get the greatest PaO2 and SaO2 at the lowest FIO2.  
Get the desired tidal volume with the lowest PIP.  
Get an acceptable ETCO2 with the least aggressive PIP and RR.  
  
**Appropriate Tidal Volumes, 5-10mLs/kg; the literature varies widely on this.** Prior to recent studies, common ventilation was to set VT at 10-15mL/kg with lower respiratory rates. Over time, studies began to surface documenting ventilator associated lung injuries such as volume trauma, barotrauma and biotraumas. As such, lower PIPs and lower tidal volumes with higher respiratory rates are now desired. Studies show that more rapid ventilator rates and lower PIPs are associated with decreased incidence of airway leaks leading to traumas.

Common VT settings are now in the range of 5-10mLs/kg, although 6-8mLs/kg is more popular with some CRNAs. For example, for a patient weighing 20kg, the tidal volume would be anywhere from 100-200mLs. If the ETCO2 is a little elevated, an increase in the respiratory rate is indicated.

**Appropriate Peak Inspiratory Pressures:  
**Most pediatric CRNAs start out with a PIP anywhere from 12-20 cmH20\. An experienced anesthesia provider can estimate an optimal starting PIP when manually bag ventilating the patient immediately after intubating. While they are ventilating, they feel and see how much they have to squeeze the bag for an adequate chest excursion. They glance over at the ventilators pressure manometer and view what pressure that it takes for adequate chest excursion. If the needle on the manometer goes up to 15cmH20 with proper chest excursion, then that is what they set their PIP to be.

Try to achieve an adequate tidal volume with the lowest PIP as possible. Adjust the ventilator settings according to the chest excursion and ETCO 2. To decrease the ETCO2 without increasing PIP or tidal volume, simply increase the RR. Remember that RR and VT relates to ETCO2.

If the PIP is minimized, there is a decreased incidence of barotrauma. High PIPs can cause a pneumothorax, or a pneumo-mediastinum and BPD. Elevated PIPs increase the mean airways pressures and therefore can impede the venous return, cardiac output and thus affect the BP. Try to never to exceed 30cmH20. Most CRNAs start out with a PIP of 12-16cmH20. Some CRNAs in practice start out with 20cmH20.  
**Note:** You can acquire the same VT with lower PIPs once the patient is relaxed.  
  
**Respiratory Rate**  
There is no specific respiratory rate to set on your ventilator at the beginning of a case. Titrate the RR to achieve the desired ETCO2. Some experienced pediatric anesthesia providers start a neonate out at 28 bpm. The spontaneous RR of a neonate is 30-50bpm and starting a neonate at 20-30 bpm is perfectly fine since they normally breathe more than 30bpm.

**Minute Ventilation (MV) MV** relates to ETCO2. MV is the volume of gas inhaled or exhaled in the lungs over 1 minute’s time. The patient’s ETCO2 is inversely proportional to the MV. To achieve a lower ETCO2, raise the MV, either by raising the patient’s RR or VT.

**RR x VT = MV. This refers to ventilation, NOT oxygenation.  
**12bpm x 500mLs = a 6 liter MV.

Another way of remembering this is to think about the cardiac output formula. CO is the volume of blood being ejected by the heart over 1 minute.  
HR x SV = CO.  
Now picture the HR is actually the same as RR and the SV being the same as VT.  
If you want to increase CO, you increase HR or SV or both.  
If you want to increase MV, you either increase RR or TV or both.

**Appropriate FIO2** **_(FIO2 of .5 is generally considered safe)_****Note:** _FIO2 is at or between 1.0 and .2 and not written as a %. Ex. An FIO2 of .4 is equivalent to 40% oxygen. Never write or state the FIO 2 is 40%._

Most anesthesia providers adjust the FIO2 accordingly to their SaO2 on the monitor.  
With premature neonates, try to have the lowest FIO2 to avoid “Retinopathy of Prematurity” (ROP). ROP used to be called “Retrolental Fibroplasia.” So any small premature neonates or a basic NICU patient, run the FIO2 around .3 just to be safe. It can be difficult to keep up with the latest research regarding the point at which premature babies are at the greatest risk of ROP from high FIO2s. So when in doubt, lower the FIO2 with neonates as tolerated.

With older kids, we tend to oxygenate at around 50% or lower. This varies on the anesthesia provider’s preference and SaO2 of the patient. Placing a pediatric patient who is not a neonate on a high FIO2 just for a 1-2 hour surgery does little harm, if any.  
  
**I:E Ratio (Inspiratory to Expiratory Ratio)  
****_A 1:2 or 1:2.5 I:E ratio is very common._**  
This is basically the inspiratory time versus the expiratory time in ratio within a total respiratory cycle. The normal I:E ratio is around 1:2; again, the literature varies.  
  
**I:E ratio of 1:2:  
Some ventilators have an I:E ratio setting  
**Setting your I:E ratio at 1:2 or 1:2.5 seems to be the most common.

**I:E ratio of 1:3:  
**An I:E ratio of 1:3 is mostly used for RAD or COPD patients who need the extra time to fully exhale due to expiratory wheezing, etc. It is still OK if a patient with normal lungs is on a 1:3 ratio as long as the RR rate is not too high. For a fast respiratory rate with a 1:3 I:E ratio, the ventilator increases the flow rate to make the inspiratory time shorter to make more time for the expiratory time. Increased flow rates cause more turbulence and less laminar flow in the airway, which increases PIP.  
  
**I:E ratio of 1:1  
**Increasing the Inspiratory time decreases the Expiratory time, thus increasing the I:E ratio  
Avoid a 1:1 I:E ratio with healthy patients. A 1:1 ratio means a prolonged inspiration time, equaling the expiratory time. Normally the Inspiratory time is a 3rd of expiratory time (1:3).  
With an Increased RR and an inversed I:E ratio, the expiratory time is shortened and may lead to air trapping and alveolar distention. A 1:1 ratio may be too close to an inversed I:E ratio, which can result in severe pulmonary complications.

However, an I:E ratio of 1:1 may be OK for RDS patients with a decreased compliance but normal resistance. There are some special ICU/NICU ventilators that have the capability to apply an inversed I:E ratio for a prolonged inspiratory time.  
  

**Inspiratory Time (T insp)  
**Some ventilator’s I:E Ratio is based on what the Inspiratory Time is set on. As you turn the knob to change the Inspiratory Time, the I:E ratio will change.

**Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP):  
****_Applying 3-5 cmH20 of PEEP is very common in pediatrics.  
_**Peep increases FRC and prevents alveolar collapse. Peep is positive pressure applied at the end of expiration to prevent the fall of airway pressure to zero. It is like leaving a little bit of air in a little rubber balloon rather than letting all the air out. PEEP stabilizes alveoli, recruits lung volume and improves lung compliance. This helps with oxygenation. When you increase PEEP, you should see an increase in SaO2. Too much PEEP (surpassing the optimal PEEP level) will decrease venous return, BP and SaO2. This is from positive intrathoracic pressure affecting the pliable vena cava by slightly compressing it.

**Goals of PEEP are:  
**Increasing FRC above closing volume to prevent alveolar collapse. This helps prevent desaturations.  
Maintains alveolar stability.  
Improves oxygenation.  
Reduction in work of breathing.

**Pulmonary Recruitment:  
**Pulmonary recruitment is the act of reinflating collapsed alveoli by sustaining an inspiratory hold above tidal ventilation. For Example, when morbidly (adult) obese patients are lying supine, they tend to have a small closing capacity. These patients are more prone to desaturating while lowering (or discontinuing) ventilation with emergence at the end of the case. When you flip the control ventilation switch to manual, shut the pop off valve almost all the way, squeeze the ventilation bag while balancing a PSI between 35-40 for 30 seconds to a minute. This forces millions of alveoli to open and increases SaO2. You have basically just “recruited” your patient.

**Flow Rates:  
**Flow rates are important because they are an important factor in PIP, waveform, I:E ratio, and on some ventilators, the respiratory rate.

On almost all anesthesia machines, flow rates are mostly based on I:E ratio and we really don’t know what the flow rate is; there is usually not a read out. On non-anesthesia volume ventilators, the flow rate is easier to immediately grasp, since you set the flow rate and see it on an LED readout. In general, a minimum flow rate at least two times the minute ventilation is required.

**For anesthesia, we basically just need to know how flow rate is related to PIP and I Time.**

Remember in physics studying the flow of fluids?  
**There are two types of flow:**  
Laminar and Turbulent.  
**A High flow rate means higher PIPs:** The faster the flow rate, the more turbulence and more pressure is created. This means a higher peak pressures and possible barotrauma to the lung parenchyma. The slower the flow, the more laminar flows occur and the lower the peak pressure, thus meaning less barotrauma. High flow rates increase the risk of alveolar rupture because the mis-distribution of ventilation results in a rapid pressure increase in the non-obstructed or non-atelectatic alveoli.

**A Lower Flow Rate means a lower PIP:** The slower the flow, the more laminar flow and therefore less pressure (PIP) and less risk for barotrauma.

The higher or faster the flow rate, the lower the I time.  
The lower the flow rate, the longer the I time.
