### Recombinant Human Factor VIIa (rFVIIa, NovoSeven)

**Other Names:** NovoSeven, NovoSeven RT, Factor VIIa, eptacog alfa, NiaStase.  
  
Activated rFVII is an inhibitor (antibody) bypassing product like FEIBA.  
Achieves hemostasis in hemophilia patients with inhibitors in about 80% of cases.  
  
**Mechanism of Action  
**Recombinant factor VIIa can bind to the surface of activated platelets, thereby directly activating factor X and leading to an improved generation of thrombin. This occurs further down the coagulation cascade bypassing the Factor VIII and IX inhibitors.  
The thrombogenic activity of rFVIIa is optimized when fibrinogen levels and pH are within the normal range.  
  
**Indications of rFVIIa  
**Treatment of bleeding episodes in hemohilia A or B with inhibitors.  
Congenital FVII deficiency  
Acquired hemophilia  
Platelet dysfunctional disorders (Glanzman’s thromboasthenia).  
Hemophilia type A and B who have a deficiency of factors VIII and IX; these two factors are administered for controlling bleeding or as prophylaxis medication before starting surgeries.  
  
**Factor VII deficiency:** (congenital proconvertin deficiency) is rare and inherited recessively.  
It presents as a hemophilia-like bleeding disorder.  
  
**Off-Label Indications**  
The reversal of Vitamin K Antagonists (VKAs).  
Severe uncontrollable bleeding–trauma, head bleed etc.  
Blood loss with patients on Direct Oral Anticoagulants.  
  
_Recombinant Factor VIIa (rFVIIa)_ _does not directly neutralize the activity of new oral anticoagulants so it is not the first choice of reversal treatments._  
  
**Dosing for Hemophilia A or B for bleeding episodes involving inhibitors**  
90 mcg/kg IV bolus q2 hours until hemostasis achieved.  
  
**Range:** 35-120 mcg/kg q2 hours until hemostasis.  
**Post-hemostatic doses for severe bleeds:** Continue with dosing q3-6 hours after hemostasis achieved as per clinical judgment.  
  
**Pre-surgical (including invasive procedures) prophylaxis for acquired or hemophilia A or B patients with inhibitors  
**90 mcg/kg IV immediately before intervention, THEN q2 hours for surgery duration.  
  
**Postsurgical dosing for minor surgery:** 90 mcg/kg IV bolus q2 hours for 48 hours, THEN q2-6 hours until healing has occurred.  
  
**Postsurgical dosing for major surgery:** 90 mcg/kg IV bolus q2 hours for 5 days, THEN q4 hours until healing has occurred.  
  
**Congenital Factor VII Deficiency**  
**Bleeding episodes or surgery:** 15-30 mcg/kg IV bolus q4-6 hours until hemostasis achieved.  
  
**Acquired Hemophilia:**  
Bleeding episodes or surgery: 70-90 mcg/kg IV bolus q2-3 hours until hemostasis achieved.  
  
**Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia:**  
Bleeding episodes: 90 mcg/kg q2-6 hours until hemostasis achieved.  
  
**Perioperative management of Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia:**  
90 mcg/kg immediately before surgery and repeat q 2hours for duration of procedure.  
90 mcg/kg q2-6 hours to prevent post-operative bleeding.  
  
**Uncontrolled hemorrhage:** up to 180mcg/kg.  
  
**Monitoring:**  
PT, aPTT, FVIII and FIX activity is unsuitable.  
Thrombin generation, TEG and aPTT analysis have been used (Hoffman and Dargaud 2012).  
  
**Onset:** 5-10 minutes  
**Duration:** 4-6 hours, used with FFP and Vitamin K in patients with elevated INR due to warfarin.  
  
Rebound of anticoagulant effect after “reversal”: 6-12 hours.  
  
Due to the reported incidences of arterial thrombosis, the off-label dosing should be the lowest possible.  
  
**Possible complications now limit the use of recombinant human factor VIIa  
**An increase in arterial thrombosis is well documented, especially with high doses.  
  
Thromboembolic events following recombinant human factor VIIa have been as high as 11%.  
FEIBA (aPCC) also has prothrombotic complications.  
  
No longer recommended or intracerebral hemorrhage because rFVIIa showed no benefit.  
  
_rFVIIa has saved many wounded American troops during the_ _Iraq War,_ _but also resulting in a high number of deep venous thromboses and pulmonary emboli, as well as unexpected strokes, heart attacks, and deaths._
