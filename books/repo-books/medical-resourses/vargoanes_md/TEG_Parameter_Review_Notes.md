## TEG Parameter Review Notes

The TEG will give you 5 numerical parameters. With the results, you can utilize the simple algorithm and know exactly what to administer to the patient. It is still important to understand the meaning of the parameters listed below.

**Measured Parameters  
**R (reaction time)  
K (K time)  
Alpha Angle  
MA (maximum amplitude)  
LY30 (lysis at 30 minutes)

**R (reaction time): 5-10 minutes**  
**R**: is a period of time the time blood was placed in the TEG analyzer until the initiation of fibrin formation  
Basically “Clotting time” impacted by coagulation Factors  
\> 10 minutes represents a deficient in clotting factors and is treated with FFP

**K (Kinetic) Time: 1-3 minutes  
**K is the time elapsed until the clot reaches a fixed strength (20mm).  
K is impacted by Fibrinogen

Together with the alpha angle, it is a measure of clot strengthening.  
Elevation of K time represents a deficiency of Fibrinogen and is treated with FFP/Cryoprecipitat

**Alpha Angle: (53-72 degrees)  
**Alpha Angle reflects the speed of fibrin accumulation and cross-linking (clot strengthening).  
Alpha Angle is impacted by: Fibrinogen

A low value represents a deficient in fibrinogen and treated with cryoprecipitate.

**MA** (Maximum Amplitude): 50-70mm  
MA is basically represents the ultimate strength of the clot.  
The taller (greater the amplitude) the stronger the clot.MA is the highest vertical amplitude of the TEG  
The MA is impacted by Platelets  
(A direct function of the maximum dynamic properties of the fibrin and platelet bonding via GPIIb/IIIa.)  
A low MA represents deficient platelets and treated with Platelets.

**LY30** 0-8%  
Basically shows clotting stability and clot breakdown.  
LY30 is the percentage of amplitude reduction 30 minutes after its maximum (MA).  
LY30 is a measure of Fibrinolysis.  
A high value indicates an excess in fibrinolysis and is treated with antifibrinolytics such as Amicar or Tranexamic Acid
