### Warfarin Reversal Notes

Oral vitamin K is preferred for patients without severe bleeding.  
IV vitamin K should be ordered only if patient has life-threatening bleeding, or needs an emergent procedure, where a shorter onset of anticoagulation reversal may be required.  
Subcutaneous or intramuscular doses are not recommended as routine care.  
Full effect of vitamin K on warfarin reversal occurs approximately 24 hours after administration.  
Partial effects may be seen in 6‐12 hours.  
Doses of vitamin K greater than 10 mg are excessive and do not reverse anticoagulation more quickly.  
  
The INR can drop or approach normal levels 1-3 days following warfarin discontinuation.  
This reflects the increase of factor VII activity.  
However, inadequate hemostasis remains possible despite a decreased INR because factor II has a longer _T_1/2 still <40% activity.  
  
Reversal of warfarin anticoagulation with plasma is indicated only if significant bleeding or risk is present.  
Often it will require recurrent transfusion to maintain normal factor levels.  
Otherwise, reversal can be achieved by giving Vitamin K two to three days prior to a planned procedure.  
  
**FFP or PCC when urgent warfarin reversal is needed  
**FFP replaces coagulation factors lowered by warfarin. It contains all coagulant factors, including II, VII, IX, and X but in diluted inactive form compared to other option.  
  
5-20 ml/kg IV (~ 10ml/min) provides partial warfarin reversal.  
**Duration of FFP:** ≤ 6-7 hours (half-life of Factor 7 is around 7 hours).
