### Neosynephrine (Phenylephrine HCl) Pharmacology and Notes

In mcg/min or mcg/kg/min.  
  
40-60 mcg/min initially then 100-180 mcg/min, Maintenance 40-80 mcg/min.  
OR  
0.05-1mcg/kg/min as drip and 5-20mcg/kg as bolus  
(Titrate to effect)  
  
Add one 10mg vial to 250ml of NS or D5W = 40mcg/ml.  
Mix two 10mg vials in 250ml of NS or D5W = 80mcg/ml (double strength).  
slows the heart rate, so do not administer in the presence of bradycardia.  
40-60 mcg/min initially then 100-180 mcg/min. Maintenance: 40-80 mcg/min.  
OR  
0.1-0.5mcg/kg/min infusion and 5-20mcg/kg as bolus.  
  
**Mechanism of Action:** Alpha adrenergic agonist.  
  
**Effect:** Constricts both arterial and venous blood vessels, increasing systemic vascular resistance without changing cardiac dynamics.  
  
**Use:** In patients who need blood pressure support.  
  
**Risk:** decreases flow of blood to all organs, reducing oxygen supply and potentiating ischemia at very high doses can have some beta effect.  
  
**Contraindications:** Low HR, because Neosynephrine causes a reflex bradycardia, the extent being dependent on dose. Incompitable with phenytoin and alkaline solutions.
