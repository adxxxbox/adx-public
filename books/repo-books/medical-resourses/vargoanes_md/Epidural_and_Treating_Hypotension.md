### Epidural and Treating Hypotension

Hypotension is not usually significant as it is with spinals if the epidural is dosed slowly.  
  
After the first 20 minutes of the initial epidural bolus, the patient is routinely monitored by the RN and not left alone. The anesthesia provider should always remain nearby.  
  
**Hypotension  
**If your patient’s systolic BP drops by 20-30% of their baseline or below 100mmHg, you should do the following:  
Ensure Left Uterine Displacement (LUD) – left lateral tilt  
More volume – Bolus IV fluids  
Neosynephrine – 40-80 mcg IV or Ephedrine 10 mg (Pressors should always be immediately available).  
  
**If the hypotension persists**  
Administer more of the vasopressor  
Administer O2 via nasal cannula.  
Monitor fetal heart rate and uterine contractions before and after administering more local anesthetic.
