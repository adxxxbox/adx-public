### Mediastinoscopy

A **Mediastinoscopy** is a diagnostic procedure using an endoscopic device to visualize for diagnosis and/or to determine the chances of a successful resection of a lung CA. It is essential in the staging of lung cancer to biopsy all mediastinal masses.

  
The mediastinum is the region between the two pleural cavities extending from the thoracic inlet to the diaphragm. It is rich in lymph nodes that are the site of localized inflammatory disease, primary lymphatic tumors or metastatic disease.

  
A lot of the older literature stresses the risk of catastrophic airway obstruction or CVR collapse on induction with large mediastinal masses. This is very rare due to earlier diagnosis from routine x-rays. MRI and CT scans give the specifics. If there is a large tumor, consider an awake fiberoptic intubation.

**  
Cervical Mediastinoscopy**This is usually an outpatient procedure. A small incision is made in the suprasternal notch. A tunnel is created through the pre-tracheal fascia along the anterior and lateral walls of the trachea, posterior to the aortic arch and down to the subcarinal area. This approach cannot visualize the thymus or anterior mediastinum because they are anterior to the aortic arch.

**  
Anterior Mediastinotomy**: **Transthoracic Mediastinoscopy or Chamberlain’s Procedure.**This is not an outpatient procedure. Another approach that’s not as popular: the third costal cartilage is resected and the mediastinum is explored without entering the pleural space. This is done to visualize the tumors of the thymus and anterior mediastinum.  
With this entrance, there is little chance of compression of the innominate artery. So the blood pressure can be measured in either arm.

**Pre-op**If there is a tumor, know the size via MRI or CT results. The severity of symptoms depends on the size and location of the mass, the rate of growth, and the invasion of adjacent vital structures. Most of these patients are asymptomatic.**  
  
Type and screen**: Yes.

**Anesthetic**: General/ETT. If this procedure is Thymus related with Myasthenia Gravis, then you have to avoid giving Anectine. Also find out if it’s a cervical approach or Anterior Mediastinotomy. With the Anterior approach, there is little chance of compression of the innominate artery. So the blood pressure can be measured in either arm.  
**ETT:** Some literature states that the use a reinforced ETT will minimize the risk of the tube kinking. Most CRNAs still use a regular ETT and the patients do fine.  
**Relaxation:** Yes, to prevent coughing, venous engorgement from straining, and movement during the procedure. A dose of short duration is indicated for a simple biopsy.  
**Position:** Supine with arms tucked. A Shoulder or head roll is common; it depends on your surgeon’s preference.  
The bed is usually rotated 90 degrees.  
  
Make sure you have circuit tubing fully extended and your tubing holder is out of the surgeon’s field. It helps to have all your lines already isolated to the proper side so you are not scrambling to remove them the last second. The surgeon will be at the head of the bed.

**A-line**: Used to be mandatory for quick assessment for the compression of the innominate artery by the dampening of the arterial waveform. We now mostly place the pulse ox sensor on the right hand and view the pleth wave as the alternative. **A-line**s are less common now.  
BP Cuff: Left arm.  
IV Access: Large bore in case of a hemorrhage. Use a lower extremity IV if the patient has Inferior Vena Cava Syndrome.  
**Nitrous Oxide:** Jaffe says don’t use it.  
  
**What to watch out for, or things to mention to the surgeon if they should occur:**  
**Reflex bradycardia:** From compression of the aorta.  
**Arrhythmias:** From mechanical stimulation of the aorta.  
Changes in the right arm **A-line** or pulse-ox waveform: From compression of the innominate artery.

**Absolute Contraindications**:  
Previous mediastinoscopy: post-op formed scar tissue makes a repeat procedure hazardous.  
Superior vena cava obstruction.  
Tracheal deviation.  
Thoracic aneurysm.  
Cerebral vascular disease.  
  
**Complications:**  
Cerebral Ischemia from compression of the innominate artery, which decreases cerebral circulation.  
Hemorrhage

Pneumothorax

Recurrent laryngeal nerve damage

Infection: mediastinitis

Tumor implantation in wound

Chylothorax

Air embolism

Transient hemiparesis

Hemothorax

Phrenic nerve injury

Esophageal injury
