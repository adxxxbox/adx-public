### Epidural Catheter Migration

**_Every bolus is a “test dose  
_**_There are many documented incidences of late migrations of a previously functioning epidural catheter into an epidural vein resulting in local anesthetic systemic toxicity in a pregnant woman.This is why every bolus following the initial test dose should ONLY be 3-5 mLs._  Epidural catheters have been demonstrated to move inward or outward 1-2cm during the period of epidural therapy.  
This catheter migration has occurred despite the various techniques to secure the catheter at the skin.
