### Aortic Regurgitation/Insufficiency Anesthesia

_Aortic Regurgitation/Insufficiency may NOT tolerate bradycardia and increased SVR.  
  
_**"Fast Full Forward"**  
**Full, mildly vasodilated and modest tachycardia is an optimal cardiovascular state.  
  
****Quick reference: Hemodynamic goals in Aortic Regurgitation**

| Parameter | Goal | Indicated | Relatively Contraindicated |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Heart rate | Keep > 80bpm | Restore sinus rhythm.  
Antimuscarinics  
Isuprel | Beta blockers |
| Preload | Maintain - full | IV fluids  
Neosynephrine | High doses of inhalation  
agents may decrease preload. |
| Afterload | Low  
(modest decrease) | Nipride  
High doses of inhalation agent.  
High dose propofol with induction. | Neosynephrine  
Vasopressin |
| Contractility | Keep adequate | Ephedrine  
Epi or norepinephrine.  
Caution: may increase afterload. | High doses of beta-blockers. |

**Note:** Neosynephrine increases venous constriction (preload) more than it increases arterial constriction (afterload), by acting as an alpha-1 agonist.  
  
**Anesthesia goals (fast)  
Keep HR > 80 bpm**  
Avoid bradycardia because a slow HR will allow more diastolic time for regurgitation to take place worsening the AR.  
  
**Maintain preload (full)**  
Adequate volume as needed.  
  
**Modest decrease in SVR (forward)  
**A lower SVR decreases the diastolic pressure gradient across the aortic valve.  
AVOID increases in SVR, it will INRCEASE the diastolic pressure gradient across the aortic valve and increase regurgitant volume and possibly heart failure.  
Vasodilation promotes forward flow, you may need to give more volume for hypotension.  
IABP is contraindicated.   
  
**Contractility:** Keep adequate  
**Rhythm:** Usually sinus; not a problem.  
  
**Possible infusions for maintenance**  
A nipride infusion can be used to maintain a decreased SVR.  
An inotrope dobutamine can be used to maintain or improve LV stroke volume and reducing regurgitant volume.  
Nipride is preferred over venodilators, but many anesthesia providers still use nitroglycerine due to the ease of manual titration not involving an infusion pump.  
  
**Monitoring  
**An arterial line is not indicated for asymptomatic AR.  
A pulmonary catheter or TEE should be considered for severe AR.**  
  
Induction  
**Consider propofol.  
Can be inhalation or IV induction because they both decrease SVR (except ketamine or etomidate).  
Use induction agents that does NOT decrease HR or increase SVR.  
  
**In absence of severe LV dysfunction  
**Nitrous oxide is OK.  
Volatile anesthetics and opioids are acceptable.  
  
**Isoflurane, sevoflurane and Desflurane  
**The 3 gases above are ideal for AR because they decrease SVR and cause little myocardial depression.  
  
**Muscle relaxants  
**Pancuronium induces mild increases in HR and would be optimal, but many facilities no longer supply it anymore.  
Vecuronium and rocuronium are both acceptable.  
  
**Narcotics and benzodiazepines  
**Be careful because high doses may cause bradycardia.  
  
**Hypotension  
**_Consider ephedrine and volume instead of neosynephrine for hypotension.  
  
_**Bradycardia or junctional rhythm**  
Treat promptly with atropine
