### Pacemaker and Magnet

We normally don’t place a magnet prophylactically on a pacemaker. A pacemaker can be interrogated pre-op or reprogrammed to an asynchronous mode at a rate greater than the patient’s underlying rate, in order to ensure that no over sensing or under sensing from the use of an electrocautery or EMI will take place.  
However, I have seen some anesthesiologists place a magnet on pacemakers (when a bovie will be used close to the pacer) that were not interrogated prior to the start of surgery and the patients did just fine.  
There is no harm placing a magnet on a pacemaker.  
In anesthesia, some policies tell us not to place a magnet on a pacemaker unless we absolutely have to!

Clinical magnets can be used to temporarily switch pacemakers to an asynchronous pacing mode, thereby preventing pacing inhibition from electrocautery (EMI). This means the pacer will remain at a fixed rate and can’t be altered by the bovie. This is the Rep’s job to come in and interrogate the pacemaker.

In anesthesia, we only place a magnet on a pacemaker when we absolutely have to! Hopefully you will never have to.

There is still some literature out there that states that NOT ALL PACEMAKERS SWITCH TO A CONTINUOUS ASYNCHRONOUS MODE WHEN A MAGNET IS PLACED. This is why we get them interrogated pre-op.  
  
Reprogramming the pacing mode to asynchronous at a rate greater than the patient’s underlying rate usually ensures that no over or undersensing from EMI will take place.  
  
However, setting a device to asynchronous mode has the potential to create a malignant rhythm in the patient with a structurally compromised myocardium. Reprogramming a device **WILL NOT** protect it from internal damage or reset caused by EMI.

Direct interrogation with a programmer remains the only reliable method for evaluating battery status, lead performance, and adequacy of current settings.   Appropriate reprogramming is the safest way to avoid intraoperative problems, especially if monopolar "Bovie" electrocautery will be used.
