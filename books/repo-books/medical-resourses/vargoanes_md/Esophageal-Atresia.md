Esophageal Atresia (EA)   

### Esophageal Atresia (EA)

**Esophageal Atresia** (EA) is characterized by incomplete formation of the esophagus-usually a closed pouch. It is often associated with a fistula between the trachea and the esophagus. Many anatomic variations of esophageal atresia (with or without a TEF) have been described. The esophagus has two segments, one that connects to the hypopharynx and the other that connects to the stomach. However, the hollow centers of these two segments do not connect to each other. This results in two separate segments. If this infant feeds, the upper segment fills up and liquid overflows into the trachea (if there is a TEF), leading to aspiration and pneumonia. For this reason, a baby with EA must remain NPO.  
  
In literature, TEF and EA are often written together because they usually occur together.
