### Harvesting Saphenous Vein (Pre-Sternotomy Down Time)

Most surgeons don’t make the sternal incision right away after intubation and give the assistant time for harvesting. This gives you more time to clean up your table top and prepare for the median sternotomy.  
  
**Endoscopic Vessel Harvesting (EVH or vaso view)**  
A minimally invasive video- assisted technique to remove saphenous vein for a graft. Has much lower infection rate than older traditional method. Less invasive and only takes about 30 minutes.  
  
They do inject C02, so watch for unexplained drops in BP.  
The Surgeon usually does not open the chest until he knows his assistant has access to the saphenous vein for a graft. Sometimes poor access could delay incision more than the standard delay.  
  
**Pre-Sternotomy Table Top (have ready)****Fentanyl:** give 5-10cc (250-500 mcg just prior to sternotomy.
