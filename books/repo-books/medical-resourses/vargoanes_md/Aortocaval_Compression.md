### Aortocaval Compression

**_(A positional complication, not a neuraxial complication)_**

All OB patients must be tilted to the left as soon as they are placed on the OR table to minimize the adverse effects of the supine position.  
  
The gravid uterus can occlude the inferior vena cava and aorta when the parturient assumes the supine position. This can decrease uteroplacental perfusion, even in the absence of anesthesia.  
  
Aortocaval compression may decrease cardiac output by 30-50%.  
  
Aortocaval compression can be prevented by placing a rolled blanket (or 1 liter IV bag) under the right hip, tilting the table, or a combination of the two methods.  
  
Left uterine displacement is **essential** regardless of whether the patient is having a regional or a general anesthetic. If intraoperative hypotension and/or tachycardia occurs, check the adequacy of left uterine tilt.
