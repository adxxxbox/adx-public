# Amiodarone

**Amiodarone (Cordarone)**  
**Class:** Class III antiarrhythmic agent. Hospital Indications IV for treatment of ventricular arrhythmias, VF/VT, or too many PVCs. **Pharmacology of Amiodarone**  
Prolongs phase 3 of the cardiac action potential and period via in both atria and ventricle without altering resting membrane potential (RMP).  
This prolongs PR, QRS and QT intervals and will decrease BP and HR.  
Relaxes vascular smooth muscle.  
Reduces peripheral vascular resistance (afterload)-can drop BP Slightly increases cardiac index.  
Shows beta blocker-like and calcium channel blocker-like actions on the SA and AV nodes.  
Increases the refractory period via sodium- and potassium-channel effects.  
Acts as a noncompetitive alpha and beta adrenergic inhibitor.  
**Doses:**  
**VF/pulseless VT**  
300 mg bolus (50mg/cc from vials), may repeat with 150mg x 1 Use the 50 mg/ml (3-ml vials) for initial dose 900mg /500 ml glass bottle (1.8mg/ml) is used for maintenance dose **Wide complex tachycardia STABLE (or too many PVCs)**  
150 mg over the FIRST -10 minutes (15 mg/min).  
Add 3 mL of Cordarone I.V. (150 mg) to 100 mL D 5 W.  
Infuse 100 mL over 10 minutes. (Though not recommended, many just draw up in a syringe and slow IV push).  
**THEN**  
**Followed by Slow: 360 mg over the NEXT 6 hours (1 mg/min)**  
Can use 900mg/500ml (1.8mg/ml) bottle- Set pump- 33 ml/hr (1mg/min) x 6 hours.  
**THEN**  
(after the 6 hours) **Maintenance infusion: 540 mg over the REMAINING 18 hours (0.5 mg/min)**  
so just decrease your pump to 17 ml/hr (30 mg/hr) for the next 18 hours.  
**Amiodorone warning**  
Has a chemical structure similar to Thyroxine, so it can cause hyper/hypothyroidism. Alters thyroid function in 2-4% of patients in long term use.  
**Adverse Effects**  
Decrease in BP with initial infusion (given too fast) Atropine resistant bradycardia can occur with general anesthesia, have Isuprel ready. It increases refractory period with WPW syndrome.  
Pulmonary Toxicity  
Thyroid Storm  
**Contraindicated:**  
Allergic to **Amiodarone** or iodine Patient in cardiogenic shock Bradycardia  
Second- or third-degree AV block unless they have functional pacer.  
Severe Sinus Syndrome
