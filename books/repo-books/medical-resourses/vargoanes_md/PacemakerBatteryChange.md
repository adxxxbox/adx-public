### Pacemaker Generator (battery) Change-Out

A minimally invasive procedure (much easier than original pacemaker insertion) that usually does not involve anesthesia unless there is airway or conscious sedation concerns.

When concerning anesthesia, usually a simple MAC case. A small incision is made over the subcutaneous pocked where the pacemaker (generator) sits. The pacemaker/ICD leads that are attached to the heart are disconnected from the old generator and connected to the new generator.

**For patients who are pacer depended**  
For patients who are pacer dependent, a temporary pacemaker may be placed through a catheter in the groin and utilized to pace the heart during the brief period between the disconnection of the old pacemaker and the connection of the new one.

**Anesthesia:** usually MAC, rarely General. Small dose of propofol prior to local injection is common.  
NC with ETCO2 sampling using the Salter cannula with oral and nasal airways readily available. PEC I block is an option to decrease the level of needed sedation.

**Note:** The only time you really need to deepen the patient is in the beginning during the local injection. This is NOT an AICD placement so there will be no shocking the patient at the end of the case.  
  
**Position:** Supine with arms to the side  
**Duration:**< 1 hour  
**IV Access:** 1 is OK  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**Hydration:** Normovolemic  
**Foley:** Rare  
  
**Possible Complications:**  
Infection  
Hematomas (may require drainage)

**More Notes**  
More than 300,000 patients in the US receive a permanent pacemaker each year.  
  
The battery in a **pacemaker** does not stop suddenly but rather loses its charge slowly, which lets the cardiologist plan the replacement date.  
Pacemaker batteries last up to 10 years  
The pacemaker rep is usually present for specific question.
