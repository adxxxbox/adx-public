# Factor VIII

**Factor VIII** (anti-hemophilic factor, AHF or FVIII).  
Hemophilia A is the most common type of hemophilia. It is also known as factor VIII deficiency or classic hemophilia.  
**Factor VIII**  
It is a cofactor for factor IXa which, in the presence of Ca+2 and phospholipids forms a complex that converts factor X to the activated form Xa.  
**Doses (always per Hematologist)**  
1 unit/kg of factor VIII increases plasma factor VIII 2%.  
So, 50 units/kg increases factor VIII by 80-100%.  
**Loading Dose:** 50 units/kg.  
Doses are rounded up to the nearest vial size.  
Doses are usually Q12 hours because of the half life of factor VIII is 8-12 hours.  
Factor VIII is usually given per slow IV bolus.  
**Infusion rate:** 3 units/kg/hour via syringe pump is commenced after a bolus loading dose.  
Dosing should be repeated every 8-12 hours but will vary with each patient.  
Post surgery or major trauma replacement may be required for up to 10 days to maintain hemostasis.  
**There are two types of factor VIII products:**  
Human plasma-derived factor VIII- 1 unit/kg raises factor VIII level by 1%.  
**Recombinant factor VIII (most common)**  
1 unit/kg raises factor VIII level by 2%  
So, 50 units/kg increases factor VIII by 80-100%.  
  
**Facts**  
30% of factor VIII are needed for adequate hemostasis during surgery.  
Factor VIII (and factor V) rarely decreases below levels required for hemostasis, even after massive transfusion. According to Miller, "low factors V and VIII appear to be an unlikely primary cause of bleeding during massive blood transfusion, such deficiencies may intensify bleeding from other causes, usually dilutional thrombocytopenia in the case of blood transfusion."  
Mild cases of hemophilia may respond to Desmopressin.  
Factor VIII activity (%) target depends on the indication.  
Post surgery or major trauma replacement may be required for up to 10 days to maintain hemostasis.  
Mild hemophilia may be treated with an injection of desmopressin. Desmopressin stimulates factor VIII production in people whose bodies can still make some factor VIII.  
**Adverse Reactions:**  
Tingling in the arm, ear, and face.  
Blurred vision.  
headache, nausea, stomach ache, and jittery feeling.  
People with HIGH levels of factor VIII are at increased risk for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
