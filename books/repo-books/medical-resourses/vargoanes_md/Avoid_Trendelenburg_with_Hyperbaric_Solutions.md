### Local Anesthetics - Avoid Trendelenburg with Hyperbaric Solutions

When performing a spinal for a C-section, we commonly use a hyperbaric local anesthetic.  
0.75 Marcaine with **8.25% Dextrose** is the most common local anesthetic used today for spinals. We all know that when dextrose is added to a local anesthetic, it becomes hyperbaric.  
  
One of the worst mistakes you can make in OB Anesthesia is placing a patient in Trendelenburg right after you administer a Marcaine with dextrose (or any other hyperbaric solution).  
  
One might think it is a great idea to treat early HYPOtension after a spinal for C-section, but this will cause the medications to move higher (caudal) and possibly cause a HIGH or TOTAL SPINAL!  
  
So for common Hypotension that immediately occurs after a spinal procedure should ALWAYS be treated with either neosynephrine or ephedrine-depending on the patient’s heart rate.  
  
On the flipside, Reverse Trendelenburg position is helpful to limit the cephalad spread of a hyperbaric local anesthetic.  
  
The spread of a hyperbaric spinal is no longer influenced by position once the spinal is set in. It is usually safe waiting 10 minutes after the initial spinal injection.
