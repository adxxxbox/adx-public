### Sinus Surgery Notes

**Nasal Surgery:**

Use an Oral Rae.

You want muscle relaxation; you don't want the patient swallowing. You will also want a smooth extubation with minimal coughing. Try giving Lidocaine .25 mg/kg.  

You will want mild hypotension to minimize bleeding.

Pre-treat to prevent PONV from swallowed blood.

Suck out the belly before the patient wakes up with a NGT. Nasal polyps are associated with increased allergic disorders like asthma.

If the patient is allergic to ASA, don't give NSAIDS.

The sinus area has a rich vascular supply blood.

The Ethmoidal and Sphenoidal nerves provide sensory innervation to the nasal cavity. These nerves can be blocked pre-op by the MD packing the nose with cocaine or other locals containing epi.

**Arterial supply the nose:** Is the internal maxillary artery and the anterior ethmoid artery. These vessels may need to be ligated in uncontrollable epistaxis.

Early in the case, the surgeon usually injects a local anesthetic with epinephrine.  This usually causes a temporary increase in BP and HR. Be especially concerned if the patient has a cardiac history. Watch the patient’s EKG for dysthymias.

The surgeon may also insert intranasal saturated gauzes. These are soaked with a local anesthetic with epi that may also increase the BP and HR.

The rigid nasal endoscope is a small instrument, like a silver pencil with a light on the end. The surgeon gets detailed close-up views of the internal nose and sinuses. A throat pack is inserted at the beginning and removed at the end of the case. Document the times.

Avoid hypertension to minimize bleeding.  Consider a beta-blocker with emergence if needed. Have an NG tube available for the surgeon at the end of the case to pass it orally to make sure the stomach is empty.

PONV is very high with these cases; especially with kids below age 15.  Maximize your antiemetics; minimize your narcotics.

After extubation, use a simple mask instead of a nasal cannula to transport to PACU. The PACU nurses will replace it with a humidified facemask or face tent.

  Intranasal Sinus procedures can be performed with or without nasal endoscopes.

Raising the head of the bed will decrease venous and arterial pressures at the site of bleeding. Aggressively treat any degree of systolic hypertension with intravenous antihypertensive agents.

After extubation, sedation should be avoided so that airway reflexes are not compromised.
