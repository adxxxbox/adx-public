## More Blood Type and Compatibility Notes

The antibodies in a human's blood plasma are always the opposite of the antigens on the same RBCs.  
For example, Blood Groups A, B, AB and O have Antigens A, B, A&B and None respectively. The respective Antibodies are Anti B, Anti A, None and Anti A & Anti B.

SO..................

Individuals with Type A blood contain antibodies to Type B blood (anti-B antibodies).  
Individuals with Type B blood contain antibodies to Type A blood (anti-A antibodies).  
Individuals with Type AB blood contain no antibodies to either Type A or Type B blood.  
Individuals with Type O blood contain antibodies to both Type A or B blood (anti-A and anti-B antibodies).

If a person of blood group A is given blood from a donor with blood group B, his anti B Antibodies will stick to the B Antigens on the 'imported' red blood cells entering his body. This makes the donated red cells Agglutinate, which can be fatal.

Group O blood has neither A and B Antigens, so this blood can be given to anyone-Universal Donors.  
Group AB blood has neither Anti A nor Anti B Antibodies, so any blood can be transfused into it = Universal Recipients.

Rh (rhesus factor)  
Rh Antigen (a protein)  
Rh for a protein found in Rhesus monkeys-also found in SOME people. Can cause a reaction.  
If protein (Antigen) is present = Rh+  
If protein Rh protein not present = Rh-

Important for Rh- mother pregnant with Rh+ child  
Sensitization of mother during delivery induces high levels of anti-Rh IgG antibodies; (block with Rhogam).

During pregnancy with subsequent Rh+ child, anti-Rh IgG can cross placenta and cause hemolytic disease of newborn (less problem if Rhogam is administered during first delivery).  
Transfusions are typically restricted to matching Rh+ donor to Rh+ recipient.

Rh - blood can be transfused into Rh- or Rh+ recipient(much like O blood can be given to any blood type).
