### Drug-Induced Sleep Endoscopy (DISE) or Study

A standard diagnostic procedure to determine if a patient qualifies for a Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulator insertion= for OSA management.  
To qualify for the procedure, the surgeon or pulmonologist will need to visualize the tongue falling back and obstructing the glottis.Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) is a diagnostic tool to assess the upper airway (UA) of snorers and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients in conditions that mimic natural sleep.  
  
After induced sleep, the pulmonologist will briefly pass a nasal endoscope far enough to view the type of UA obstruction above the glottis.  
Once that is observed and recorded, the procedure is over.  
  
DISE must be performed in a room where all the essential resuscitation equipment (e.g., oxygen supply) is available because safety is paramount.  
The room should also be quiet and dark.  
  
Several drugs or drug combinations can be used to induce sleep.  
The most common sleep sedation anesthesia providers use is a low-dose propofol infusion.  
  
**Propofol dose:** Enough to induce sleep and UA obstruction without apnea.  
Some physicians have their infusion protocol for you to utilize.  
  
**Anesthesia:** MAC, usually low-dose propofol  
**Common cocktails by anesthesia providers:** 50-70 mg bolus of propofol  
**Common protocol:** Start with a propofol infusion of 50 mcg/kg/min and increase in increments until the patient is obstructing.  
  
**Location of procedure:** Office, pre-op area, or main operating room.  
**Room environment:** Quiet and dark  
**Position:** Supine to patient comfort  
**Duration:** 15-30 minutes  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**Bi-spectral index (BIS) monitoring:** Sometimes to assess the level of sedation.  
The BIS should be between 70 and 50 when the UA is evaluated in adults.  
  
**Extra notes:**  
REM sleep cannot be reproduced with propofol sedation.  
DISE usually takes 15–30 minutes as only N2 sleep can be achieved.  
The patients are usually observed in the supine decubitus position because this is the position where most of the UA obstruction occurs.  
REM sleep cannot be reproduced with propofol sedation.
