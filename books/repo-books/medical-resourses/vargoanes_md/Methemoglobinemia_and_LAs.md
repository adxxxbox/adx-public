### Local Anesthetics and Methemoglobinemia

Prilocaine and Benzocaine - higher risk  
  
**Review of methemoglobinemia**  
Normal hemoglobin (Hb) contains iron in the ferrous form (Fe2+).  
Methemoglobinia (MHb) results from the oxidation of the iron in the hemoglobin from the ferrous (Fe2+) state to the ferric (Fe3+) state which renders it unable to bind oxygen.  
  
In addition, MHb shifts the oxygen dissociation curve of the remaining Hb to the left; making it more difficult for the oxygen to disassociate and supply the tissue.  
  
Less than 1% methemoglobin is present in normal red blood cells and is rapidly converted back to hemoglobin by reduced cytochrome b5.  
  
MHb may rarely be caused genetically: (deficiency of NADH-MetHb or abnormal Hb such as HbM).  
  
Most common cause of MHb is exposure to drugs or chemicals which accelerate the hemoglobin oxidation rate.  
  
All topical local anesthetics may cause MHb, but benzocaine is the most documented.  
A metabolite that is thought to be an N-hydroxy derivative appears to exert the toxic effects of benzocaine because of its oxidizing capabilities.  
  
**Onset of MHb with benzocaine:** Within minutesIn most cases, excessive amounts of benzocaine were employed, but MHb has also occurred following normal doses.  
As little as 15-25 mg/kg benzocaine is capable of inducing MHb and producing recognizable cyanosis.  
  
**Methemoglobinemia and prilocaine  
**Higher doses of > 500-600 mg or (8mg/kg) may result in methemoglobinemia and do not have significant consequences in healthy patients.  
  
**Treatment for MHb:** 1-2 mg/kg of 1% Methylene Blue – slow IV push over 5-10 minutes. Goal is to restore the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.  
  
**How does Methylene Blue work?**  
Methylene blue acts as a cofactor to greatly accelerate NADPH methemoglobin reductase in the reaction converting methemoglobin to hemoglobin.  
Methylene blue is reduced to leukomethylene blue by accepting electrons from NADPH. Leukomethylene blue donates an electron to reduce methemoglobin to hemoglobin.  
MHb is usually reduced by 50% within 30-60 minutes.  
Rebound MHb can occur several hours after successful treatment and repeat administration of methylene blue may be required.  
  
**If methylene blue does not work**  
If response to methylene blue is poor, treatment alternatives include blood transfusion, exchange transfusion, and hemodialysis.  
Ascorbic acid 300-1000mg/day IV in divided doses may be given.  
It should also be noted that methylene blue at high doses (7mg/kg) may also precipitate MHb.  
  
This is seen with temporary drops in a patient's SaO2 after a given bolus.  
  
Lower doses of methylene blue 1% (0.3-0.5 mg/kg) should be administered in patients with G6PD deficiency.  
  
**Signs and Symptoms of MHb**  
MHb is characterized by cyanosis that is not relieved by 100% oxygen.  
Arterial blood appears chocolate brown and will not change to red upon exposure to air.  
  
Many signs of acute MHb are masked by general anesthesia, making the use of topical anesthetics in the pre-anesthesia setting of particular concern.  
  
**Pulse oximetry and ABGs are misleading with MHb**  
MHb interferes with the standard technology used to calculate or measure the actual oxygen level in the body.  
The absorbance spectra needed to accurately measure oxygenation during MHb are not available in two wavelength pulse oximeters resulting in falsely elevated O2 readings in patients with MHb. SaO2 may read > 80% while the actual oxygen saturation may be as low as 40-50%.  
Co-oximetry (using many wavelengths of light) is a more accurate way of measuring methemoglobin levels and thus diagnosing the disorder.
