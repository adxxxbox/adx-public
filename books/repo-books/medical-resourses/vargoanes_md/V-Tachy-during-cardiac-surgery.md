### Ventricular Tachycardia and Fibrillation during Cardiac Surgery

The safest place to have a life-threatening arrhythmia is during cardiac surgery with the chest open.  
  
Abnormal electrolytes, inotropes and cardiac manipulation are the most likely causes of lethal dysrhythmia during cardiac surgery.  
  
Both VF and pulseless VT require immediate response. The immediate intervention is internal defibrillation. This may be followed by open-chest cardiac massage.  
  
Cardiopulmonary bypass may be immediately while efforts are made by the anesthesia team to restore cardiac function.  
  
**Review of Treatment**  
**Ventricular tachycardia with a pulse:** Amiodarone  
**Ventricular tachycardia with prolonged QT interval:** if polymorphic, consider **torsades de pointes** and correct any electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue any drugs that prolong QT interval.  
  
In torsades, the morphology of the QRS complexes varies from beat to beat. The ventricular rate can range from 150 beats per minute (bpm) to 250 bpm.  
  
Most cases, Torsades exhibits polymorphism, but the axis changes may not have regularity.  
  
The definition also requires that the QT interval be increased markedly (usually to 600 msec or greater).  
  
Cases of polymorphous ventricular tachycardia in which the QT interval is **NOT PROLONGED** are treated as generic ventricular tachycardia.  
  
Torsades usually occurs in bursts that are not sustained; thus, the rhythm strip usually shows the patient's baseline QT prolongation.  
  
**Treatment of torsades differs from that of regular ventricular tachycardia.**  
In particular, the use of group Ia antidysrhythmic drugs (e.g. amiodarone) which prolong the QT interval, can have disastrous consequences in torsades.  
Differentiating between regular V-Tachy ventricular tachycardia and torsades is critically important.  
  
**Amiodarone** can help induce torsades.  
  
**Other Causes of VF during Cardiac Surgery:**  
Air embolism in the coronary vessels or bypass grafts.  
Myocardial ischemia.  
Heart failure.  
Migration of the pulmonary artery catheter into the RV or RV outflow tracts.  
Pacemaker misfires (R on T phenomenon).  
  
The above arrhythmias can occur anytime perioperatively. There can be many contributing factors present, even when transporting the patient immediately following surgery.  
  
Preparation for transport includes ensuring availability of proper monitoring, emergency medications and flush syringes.  
  
**How to identify a life-threatening arrhythmia:**  
ECG abnormalities (not always present).  
Loss of arterial pressure wave tracing.  
Loss of pulse oximeter plethysmographic waveform.  
Falling ETCO2.
