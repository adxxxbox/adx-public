### Tirofiban (Aggrastat) Reversal

_Currently, there is a lack of specific antidotes for the growing number of new (novel) anticoagulants that are slowly replacing warfarin and heparin. For this reason, there is NO universal standard of care for the treatment of the anticoagulated bleeding patient when there is no specific antidote._

**Consult cardiology for ALL patients with coronary stents.**

**Quick Notes  
**Reversible GP IIb/IIIa Inhibitor. Considered an “anti-platelet” medication.  
Coagulation parameters return to normal 4 to 8 hours after the drug is withdrawn.  
**Short elimination half-life:** 2 hours, prolonged with renal insufficiency.  
  
**Other GP IIb/IIIa Inhibitors  
**Eptifibatide (Integrillin®): reversible.  
Abciximab (Reopro®): irreversible.  
  
**Specific Antidote:** None  
  
**Initial Treatment:  
Non-urgent:** Discontinue.  
Has a short half-life. Should be cleared in around 2-4 hours.  
  
**Urgent: Not Bleeding**  
Wait 2-4 hours for elimination of drug. If platelet count < 20,000/µl, consider transfusion of 1 unit of platelets. However, eptifibatide is rarely associated with thrombocytopenia.  
Recommend hematology consult. Recommend cardiology consult.  
  
**Minor bleed** Desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg x 1.  
Tranexamic acid: Little literature available.  
  
**Emergent (bleeding or surgery within 6 hours)**  
Hematology and/or cardiac consult  
Platelet transfusion (1 unit) if intervention is truly emergent or serious bleeding.  
  
**Major bleeding:** Platelet transfusions plus infusion of 10 units of cryoprecipitate.  
Hemodialysis.  
Tranexamic acid.  
  
**Life-threatening bleed  
**Transfuse more platelets.  
Initiate massive transfusion protocols.  
FEIBA 8 to 25 units/kg or Kcentra can be considered.  
  
**Monitor:** Evaluate platelet function with assays.  
Thrombin receptor activating peptide-based tests (VerifyNow IIb/IIIa test).  
  
**PT/PTT:** no measurable effect when administered alone.
