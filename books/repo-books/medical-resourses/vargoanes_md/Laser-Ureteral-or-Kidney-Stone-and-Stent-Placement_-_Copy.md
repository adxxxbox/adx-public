### Laser Ureteral or Kidney Stone and Stent Placement

Whenever you have a procedure that has a “ Laser” listed, you know that the surgeon will almost always require NO MOVEMENT!  
This means General/ETT with muscle relaxation or a Spinal.  
These procedures are done under X-ray guidance (Fluoroscopy) to confirm that the stent is in the correct place, curling in the kidney & in the bladder

_**If the patient coughs, the unexpected movement could cause dire consequences.**_

This procedure is part of a cystoscopy. Please also read the Cystoscopy and Holmium Laser as well. The urologist has to perform a cystoscopy in order to enter the ureter.

Depending on the size of the stone and the diameter of the ureter, the stone may be fragmented and/or removed.  
The most common method of fragmentation is performed using a laser. The laser is passed through the utreroscope to fragment the stone into smaller pieces.

Stone fragments can be collected for analysis by passing a stone basket through the ureteroscope.

**Anesthetic:** General/ ETT with relaxation is standard. Spinal is rare but optional (T9-T10 level). Some urologist will permit an LMA without relaxation. Check with the urologist.  
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes  
**Position:** Lithotomy  
**EBL:** Minimal  
After the lasering and removing a ureteral or kidney stone, the ureter may swell from irritation and occlude. It is common practice for a urologist to insert a ureteral stent.

**Stent Placement**  
Basically inserted to keep a ureter patent.  
Passage of the ureteroscope may result in swelling of the ureter. Therefore, they usually insert a stent. The stent travels from the kidney, down the ureter and into the bladder. Occasionally, a thin string attached to the end of the stent will be left exiting the bladder. This will aid future removal of the stent once the swelling subsides. The stent may also assist in the passage of any residual stone fragments. It is not uncommon for some patients to experience some discomfort from the stent. A minor amount of blood is expected in the urine while the stent is in place.

Ureteroscopy (URS) can be used safely in pregnancy and may be the favored approach in patients with bleeding disorders, on blood thinners or who are morbidly obese. In addition, patients with stones in an abnormally formed kidney may be treated best with URS.

URS is considered safe and effective, but, as with any procedure, risks exist. They include perforation of the ureter and formation of scar tissue that narrows the diameter of the ureter. These adverse events are encountered more frequently when a stone is found lodged or embedded in the wall of the ureter. If perforation occurs, an attempt will be made to place a temporary stent within the ureter to allow the area to heal. In the event that a stent cannot be safely placed, a small tube may need to be placed into the kidney to direct urine away from the damaged area. Fortunately, scar tissue formation in the ureter is rare, occurring in less than one percent of cases. However, when it happens, obstruction to the flow of urine may result. Obstruction can cause pain and may damage the kidney if allowed to persist. Additional intervention is often necessary to treat the narrowed area.

**Possible Complications:**  
Perforation or a tear anywhere along the ureter. The risk of perforation increases with the complexity of the procedure being performed. Most perforations can be managed.

Bleeding (usually minor and easily treated, but occasionally requiring transfusion)-rare Catheter migration or dislodgement (may require readjustment) Coiling of the stent within the ureter (may cause lower abdominal pain or flank pain on urination, urinary frequency, or blood in the urine) Introduction or worsening of infection Penetration of adjacent organs (e.g., bowel, gallbladder, or lungs)
