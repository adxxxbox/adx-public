Wilms' Tumor and Anesthesia - Nephrectomy   

### Wilms’ Tumor and Anesthesia - Nephrectomy

**(Also read “Wilms’ Tumor – Notes and Facts”)**

Further assess your patient for any other associated abnormalities as this can greatly impact your anesthetic plan. Ultimately, if no other comorbidities or abnormalities are present, this is a basic nephrectomy.

**Example:** Some kids have Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, meaning the child may have macroglossia (enlarged tongue) making a difficult intubation.

**Age range** : 1- 5 years. Average age is 3 years old.

**Some associated issues that MAY be present:  
**Chemotherapy associated issues - cardiac, hepatic, and coagulopathy  
Difficult airway - Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome  
Associated hypertension?  
On antihypertensive meds? Captopril is popular.  
Overgrowth syndromes - may require larger airway equipment than the predicted age or weight.  
Polycythemia from excessive erythropoietin production from the tumor  
Immunocompromised/immunosuppression from chemotherapy

Hopefully you won't have to deal with any of the above, but just be aware of them. They are listed in detail further below.  
  
**Pre-op:**  
**Extensive lab work** \- Coags, liver function, CBC and BMP will tell you a lot.  
**T & C with 2 units of PRBCs available.** Because of location of tumor, blood loss can be significant. Make sure the circulating checks for parental/directed donor blood.  
**Platelet Function:** Have it checked pre-operatively. 10% of these patients may have acquired von Willebrand's disease. Consider cryoprecipitate if needed.

**Airway** : as mentioned above, may be difficult.  
**CXR:** Are the lungs involved? (metastatic? - rare). Is the tumor pushing up against the diaphragm causing a mechanical restriction?

**Operating room temp** : Make sure the room is at least 75 degrees F before you bring the patient back. Avoid hypothermia throughout the surgical course (i.e. hypothermia potentially leading to coagulopathy issues, etc).

Have antihypertensive meds available for throughout the case.

**Vascular access device (VAD):** Does your patient have a port-a-cath, PICC line or central venous catheter (CVC)? Some patients do who are receiving chemotherapy. You can perform an IV induction with it.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT/Epidural

**Epidural:** low thoracic level, T9/10. Epidural is not advised if the patient will go on CPB due to heperanization. Modified RSI for patients with large tumors pressing up against the abdomen.

**Positioning:** Supine  
  
**Intermittent IVC compression:** Yes, clearly communicate with surgeon about large pressure drops. IVC compression may occur while the surgeon mobilizes the kidney.  
**Sudden hypertension:** From the surgeon handling the tumor. Phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine, and Nipride for sudden hypertension.

**CVP** : Rare.  
  
**IV Access:** 1-2 large bore. Jaffe says an EJ or upper extremity IV is preferred due to potential obstruction of the IVC during surgery. Avoid lower extremity IVs.  
**Hydration: 4:2:1** **(below is just a common reference)**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**A-line:** Preferred/recommended due to potential for hemodynamic instability during tumor handling and associated hypertension.

Do not use long acting beta-blockers or Precedex because they will bock the normal tachycardic response to hypotension.

**Blood tubing and warmer:** Readily available  
**Ventilation:** Possible increased peak inspiratory pressures (PIP's) from increased intra-abdominal pressure (tumor and/or surgical course of resection pushing against diaphragm preventing full lung/diaphragmatic expansion).  
**Duration:** 2-6 hours  
**EBL:** Dependent upon surgeon & tumor severity. Blood loss can be significant. Expect 20-50mL/kg  
**Fluid warmer:** Yes  
**Underbody warming blanket:** Yes  
**Foley:** Yes;1mL/kg/h of UO goal  
**CPB:** Only with severe venous extension

**Post op Extubation  
**Generally able to extubate but dependent on the extent and duration of the procedure. The patient may need to remained intubated (requiring post op ventilation) when there is excessive blood loss, suspicion of secondary hemorrhage, prolonged procedure and pulmonary atelectasis from abdominal retraction.

**Possible Complications  
**Hemorrhage  
Hypertension Crisis  
Upstaging from tumor leakage  
Postoperative surgical complications occur in 20% of all resections.  
40% when the tumor extends up the IVC to or beyond the hepatic veins.  
Pulmonary Embolus or CVA with intra-cardiac involvement.

**Other Notes and Facts**  
Review Other link “Wilms Tumor Notes and Facts”  
Associated hypertension is believed to be from an active release of renin. ACE Inhibitors (Captopril) are effective. Be cautious with beta blockers and adrenergic blockers as they could cause prolonged hypotension. Short acting agents to control BP are recommended intraoperatively. Renin levels return to normal within hours of resection, however the BP may take months to normalize. Various combinations of labetalol, hydralazine, diazoxide, diuretics and prazosin have not been effective in the controlling blood pressure preoperatively.

**Chemotherapeutic drugs and possible negative effects**  
**Actinomycin D:** can impair the liver and coagulation  
**Vincristine:** may cause syndrome of SIADH  
  
**Doxorubicin: (** An anthracycline) potential for cardiac damage, dysrhythmias, and acute cardiomyopathy. Hopefully your patient has had a recent echocardiography to assess myocardial contractility.  
  
**Excising the Tumor:** The surgeons' goal is to excise the large tumor without rupturing the tumor capsule. Tumor spillage immediately up stages the overall tumor classification (stage I disease to stage II or III, etc) which may require a more aggressive treatment.

**Hypovolemia:** Remember, this is an open belly procedure. There is third space fluid loss combined with surgical bleeding.

Polycythemia may be present, but very rare.

**Other Anesthetic Concerns  
**Various combinations of labetalol, hydralazine, diazoxide, diuretics and prazosin have not been effective in the controlling blood pressure preoperatively.

Pulmonary Embolus with extravascular extension

Coagulopathy from acquired von Willebrand's disease

Other anomalies and over growth syndromes may be present

  
If **intravascular extension is present:** Hepatic congestion, dysfunction and ascites may be present if hepatic venous drainage is impaired.

Pleural effusions may be present

TEE when the IVC is being manipulated in non-CPB approaches checking for pulmonary embolus.

If intracardiac extension is present, partial or full CPB with or without deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) may be utilized.
