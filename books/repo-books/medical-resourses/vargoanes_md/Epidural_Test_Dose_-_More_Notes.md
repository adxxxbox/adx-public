### Epidural Test Dose - More Notes

Today there is a variety of epidural test doses utilized in OB. Unfortunately, due to the occasional false negatives, there is still no perfect dose.  
  
**Disadvantage of epinephrine when used as part of a test dose:**  
It may decrease uteroplacental perfusion.  
It may prolong the first stage of labor when doses greater than 50mcg are administered  
per epidural.  
(A 1/200,000 concentration of epinephrine contains 5 μg/ml of epinephrine).  
  
If you inject your patient with a full dose of your local anesthetic AFTER your negative test dose and the patient does not experience relief, do NOT inject any more local anesthetic.  
  
Calimaran et al (Anesth Analg 2003;96:1167) suggests that the use of 3 cc of normal saline and 3 cc of 1.5% lidocaine with 1/200,000 epinephrine after CSE can decrease mobility.  
  
Many critics today still claim that a test dose for a laboring patient is an unreliable indicator of intravascular injection, because of the other factors that may simultaneously increase the heart rate resulting in false positives.  
  
2% lidocaine with epinephrine 5 micrograms/mL (1:200,000) remains the standard combination for test dose.
