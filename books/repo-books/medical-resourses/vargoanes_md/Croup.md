### Croup (Laryngotracheobronchitis)

A _Haemophilus parainfluenzae_ VIRUS type I respiratory infection that creates subglottic swelling, a distinguished barking cough and may cause airway obstruction

Before these patients present, they must have been unsuccessfully treated with IV decadron and aerosol treatments of epinephrine or racemic epinephrine. This would be in the "severe" phase of the illness. The loudness of the stridor is not a good indication of the severity of the obstruction.

**Etiology:** Viral, usually _Haemophilus parainfluenzae_ virus type 1.  
**Can be caused by:**  
Haemophilus parainfluenzae type II  
Haemophilus parainfluenzae type III  
RSV  
Rhinovirus

**Age range** : Usually 3 months to 3 years. Most texts read < 3 years.

**Airway location:** laryngeal or supraglottic

**Season:** autumn and early winter

**Breath Sounds:** inspiratory stridor and may have associated widespread wheezes

**Complete Airway obstruction:** very rare

**Diagnostic imaging:** PA X-ray “steeple sign” or narrowing of subglottic region

**Onset:** gradual and exacerbates at night and actually improves outside with cool air

**Fever:** low, sometimes no fever

**Location of swelling:** subglottic, below the glottis

**Sex:** Male > Female

**Cough** : barky cough and may have some stridor

**Neck swelling:** very little

**Risk Factors for severe croup:  
**\- Pre-existing narrowing of upper airways  
\- Subglottic stenosis- congenital or secondary to prolonged neonatal ventilation  
\- Down Syndrome  
\- Previous admissions with severe croup  
\- Uncommon <6 months, rare <3 months of age  
\- Consider alternative diagnosis such as acute upper airway obstruction

**Quick Assessment Symptoms:  
**\- Cold symptoms  
\- Low fever  
\- Barking cough  
\- Hoarseness

**Acute Management:  
**\- Minimal handling including examination and nursing with parents.  
\- Supplemental oxygen is not usually required. If needed, consider severe obstruction.  
\- Do not forcibly change a child's posture.  
\- The child will adopt the posture that minimizes airways obstruction.  
\- IV access should be deferred.  
\- Avoid further stress to the child.

**Induction:** Inhalation induction is preferred. There is usually an IV. If the patient does not have an IV proceed with Sevoflurane induction maintaining spontaneous respirations.

**Direct laryngoscopy:** Routine with the Glidescope available.

**ETT:** 1 size smaller ETT is preferred due to a narrow airway.

**Severe Airway Obstruction:**  
\- As the airway becomes obstructed, the child will appear increasingly more exhausted.  
\- Tachycardia is usually present.  
\- Restlessness, agitation, irrational behavior  
\- Decreased LOC  
\- Hypotonia  
\- Cyanosis and marked pallor are late signs indicating a dangerous airway obstruction  
\- Stridor will become softer especially in the presence of lethargy, irritability, anxiety, tachycardia, hypotonia or pallor.  
\- As air entry decreases stridor volume decreases.  
\- The child should not be unnecessarily disturbed other than the immediate receiving oxygen and nebulizer treatments of epinephrine prior to intubating.

**Treatment:  
**\- Oxygen  
\- Steroids (dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg PO/IM)  
\- Aerosol treatments-racemic epinephrine  
\- For full respiratory arrest where bag valve mask ventilation is unsuccessful, attempt intubation with a tube one size smaller than usual for age.  
\- Needle cricothyrotomy is a last resort.
