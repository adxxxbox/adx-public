### Vorapaxar sulfate (Zontivity) Reversals

_Currently, there is a lack of specific antidotes for the growing number of new (novel) anticoagulants that are slowly replacing warfarin and heparin. For this reason, there is NO universal standard of care for the treatment of the anticoagulated bleeding patient when there is no specific antidote._

**Consult cardiology for ALL patients with coronary stents.**

**Quick Notes**  
Vorapaxar has a long half-life which makes it effectively irreversible.  
Usually used in conjunction with aspirin and/or clopidogrel with makes it more complex to reverse.  
Effective half-life is 3-4 days; apparent terminal half-life of drug and active metabolite approximately 8 days (range 5-13 days).  
Use of platelet transfusion might help to reverse the antiplatelet effect of vorapaxar post T1/2, but there has been no clinical experience with this technique.  
**For overdose:** neither dialysis or platelet transfusion will help.  
  
_Unclear if platelet transfusion will be effective in reversing if administered within 5-7 days of the last dose of Vorapaxar.  
_  
**Lab Test stat:  
**Discontinue drug and document last dose.  
Platelet function assay.  
  
**Minor bleeding:  
**Apply mechanical pressure.  
Hematology consult.  
Tranexamic acid: 1 gram.  
Desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg x 1.  
1 unit of platelets if > 40% platelets inhibited.  
  
**Major bleeding:**  
Hematology consult.  
Platelet transfusion: consider two units if critical neurosurgery/eye surgery or if dual agent therapy.  
  
Inhibition of platelet aggregation can be expected for weeks after discontinuation of normal dosing.  
  
**Life-threatening  
**Transfuse more platelets.  
Initiate massive transfusion protocols.  
FEIBA 8 to 25 units/kg or Kcentra can be considered.
