### Turbinectomy

Is an excision of a turbinate bone or nasal concha. The procedure is for the removal of enlarged turbinates. This procedure is frequently done along with a Septoplasty. It involves a careful trimming and reducing of the soft fleshy swellings of the turbinates. It improves nasal breathing by increasing the diameter of the cross-sectional area of the nasal channel.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT with an oral Rae; consider an LTA kit.  
**Muscle Relaxant:** Theoretically, they don’t need to be relaxed, but we usually do to avoid bucking.  
**Inhalation Agent:** Sevo or Forane are popular for these procedures.

**Duration:** 45-90 minutes  
**EBL:** 20-50 mLs.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
**Positioning:** Supine with the HOB up 10-20 degrees or reverse T-berg. On the side of the bed that the surgeon sits on, the patient’s arm should be tucked.  

**Antiemetics:** Yes to Decadron and Zofran.

**NGT:** For the surgeon to pass ORALLY after the throat pack is out.  
**Avoid hypertension:** The goal is to minimize bleeding but stay within 20% of the base. Consider a beta-blocker with emergence. You can titrate your inhalation agent to the desired BP.

**Emergence:** Smooth, avoid coughing. Lidocaine .25 mg/kg will help. Consider Robinul to prevent secretions from draining onto and agitating the vocal cords. Gently suction the oral pharynx with a catheter (not a Yankauer). At the end of the operation, it is not uncommon to have a pack or sponge dressing in each nostril to soak up any blood. This is kept in for a few hours. The patient is now an obligate mouth breather.

**Extubation:** Deep or Awake? Some CRNAs insert an LMA immediately after a deep extubation and transport the patient to the recovery room. The LMA is removed when the patient awakes. This drastically decreases turnover time.

**Possible Complications:**

Bleeding  
Infection  
Blindness  
Eye Muscle Injury.  
Spinal Fluid Leak.  
Meningitis

**Spinal Fluid Leak: CSF rhinorrhea**  
If the surgeon notices the leakage of spinal fluid, he or she will stop the procedure and the patient will be admitted for observation.
