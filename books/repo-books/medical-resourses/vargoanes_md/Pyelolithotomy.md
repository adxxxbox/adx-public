Pyelolithotomy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Pyelolithotomy

Pyelolithotomy is an open procedure going directly into the kidney to remove a stone(s). It is invasive and now uncommonly performed. The less invasive procedures such as percutaneous nephrolithotomy with contact lithotripsy (PCN) and extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) has reduced the indications for pyelolithotomy.   
**Anesthetic;** General/ETT  
**Duration:** 1-3 hours  
**Position:** Usually prone or lateral.  
It is preferable to open the renal pelvis posteriorly rather than anteriorly. This approach will avoid the renal vein, which often runs along the upper part of the anterior surface of the pelvis.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
**EBL:** 50-200mLs  
  
**Possible Complications**  
Renal vascular injury  
Bowel injury  
Damage to the renal parenchyma can be avoided if only the renal pelvis is incised. The degree of dissection around the renal pelvis will not affect renal function.
