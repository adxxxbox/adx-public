## Branchial Fistula of the Second Branchial Cleft

The open fistula extends from the neck near the mid or lower part of sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) to the oropharynx- usually in the intratonsillar cleft of palatine tonsil.

When the patient drinks fluid, some of the fluid may actually emerge from the neck is indicative of this kind of sinus tract.

The third and fourth branchial pouch (sinus) are clinically similar because they both originate from the pyriform sinus (lateral to the glottis) and may exit the neck appearing as are current neck or thyroids abscess.

(**Pyriform Sinus** is on either side of the laryngeal orifice and easily viewed with a direct laryngoscopy)

Surgery is usually not indicated if the fistula is asymptomatic.  
Unfortunately, most are symptomatic and the surgical excision is needed to avoid the risk of recurrent infection and for cosmetic reasons.

**Symptoms**  
Intermittent or continuous mucous discharge.  
Recurrent attacks of inflammation following an attack of upper respiratory tract infection.  
Frank cellulitis or abscess formation may occur requiring an incision and drainage.  
The external opening may be seen to move upwards with deglutition.  
Probing the tract may sometimes produce symptoms of cough, palpitation, pallor and vomiting because of the tract’s proximity the vagus nerve.

**Diagnosis**  
Biopsy - pathologically, the fistula lining consists of squamous epithelium.  
Fistulogram will show a tract extending from the opening in the neck until the tonsillar region. It displays length and the location of the tract.  
X-ray  
CT Scan  
MRI  
  
The walls of a tuberculous fistula are very irregular.

**Surgical Procedure**  
**Fistula Procedure-Can be a two steps neck incision**

The surgeon makes a neck incision and inserts a tonsillar snare wire into the fistula and advances it through the neck opening upwards along the fistula tract. The tract may be made free from its attachments and dissected upwards keeping the snare wire as guide.  
  
**A second incision** is made in the upper part of the neck at the level of the hyoid bone. The tract is delivered upwards through the incision and a dissection is carried out further towards the tonsillar fossa. Gentle traction is applied on the tract and it could be followed up to the tonsillar fossa. The tract is then ligated at the point of its entry into the tonsillar fossa. The fistula is removed.  
  
Literature states the surgeon may want to perform a direct or flexible laryngoscopy to visualize or the pyriform sinus apex (seeing a small hole in the pyriform sinus fossa next to the glottis). A cholangiocath can be used to cannulate the tract prior to dissection. This is rare.

Some surgeons start with an endoscopy which enables them to cannulate the tract from pyriform sinus (with a cholangiocath) and advance it to facilitate localization of the tract during resection. This is also rare.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT or LMA, check with the surgeon.  
**Airway:** The neck may be swollen and inflamed from infection, but usually not enough to impede the airway. Always assess.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Ask the surgeon.  
**Position:** Supine, with arms to the side. Shoulder roll with donut beneath the cranium so that the neck is extended. Head of bed is raised slightly to decrease venous blood pressure in the head and neck.  
The chin is turned away from the operative side.  
**Duration:** 1-4 hours  
**A-line:** Not needed  
**IV Access:** One good flowing IV -age appropriate. Large bore not required.  
NS or LR and have albumin ready.  
Utilize the 4:2:1  
Albumin dose for anesthesia induced mild hypotension: 10cc/kg (<10kg)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for anesthesia induced mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for anesthesia induced mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg)  
  
**Blood Bolus dose:** 10-20cc/kg if needed.

**EBL:** usually minimal. The surgeon identifies and isolates the jugular vein and carotid arteries when anatomically necessary.  
**EBV:** Minimal, when necessary,  
3 months - 1 year: 70 - 80cc/kg  
1 - 4 years: 70cc/kg  
Adult: 55 - 60cc/kg

**Age Range:** Neonate - Adult  
**Contraindications**  
Acute infection (treat prior to excision)  
Medical contraindication to elective surgery

**More Notes**  
**Second arch anomalies are classified into four types.**

**Type I:** Lesions lie anterior to the SCM and do not come in contact with the carotid sheath.  
  
**Type II:** Lesions are the most common and pass deep to the SCM and either anterior or posterior to the carotid sheath.  
  
**Type III:** Lesions pass between the internal and external carotid arteries and are adjacent to the pharynx.  
  
**Type IV:** Lesions lie medial to the carotid sheath close to the pharynx adjacent to the tonsillar fossa.  
  
These fistulae are almost always present at birth with a small pinpoint external opening which may go unnoticed. Some patients may also have conductive or sensory neural deafness as well as other anomalies of the first and second arch derivatives.  
  
A persistent fistula of the second branchial cleft and pouch usually has its external opening in the neck near mid or lower part of SCM muscle. As it ascends it pierces platysma. At the level of hyoid it curves medially and passes between the external and internal carotids in relation to the hypoglossal and glossopharyngeal nerves. It opens in to the oropharynx usually in the intratonsillar cleft of palatine tonsil.  
  
A majority of these patients have a history of intermittent discharge and infection of neck sinus since birth.  
  
Branchial fistulas are commonly present with a persistent mucoid discharge from an opening in the skin of the neck.  
  
A complete branchial fistula with external and internal opening is rare. The completeness of a fistula is diagnosed by a dye test in which methylene blue is injected through the outer opening and appears in the throat. A negative preoperative outcome on the test might become positive under general anaesthesia because of muscle relaxation. Occasionally, the fistula tract may be blocked by secretion or granulation giving negative fistula test.  
In some cases, saliva is seen dribbling from the neck opening, which itself proves the completeness of the tract.
