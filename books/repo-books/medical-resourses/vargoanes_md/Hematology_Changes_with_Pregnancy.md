### Hematology Changes with Pregnancy

Total Blood Volume ↑ 20-40%  
Plasma Volume ↑ 40-50%  
RBC Volume ↑ 20%HCT ↓ 35% from dilutional anemia  
Hb ↓ 15% (11.5 g/dL)  
  
**Hb Levels**  
Total Hb levels increase around 10% between weeks 8-24.  
After week 24, the Hb level decreases due to dilution and increased blood volume.  
  
**Plasma Volume** The plasma volume increases up to 50% by term.  
RBC volume also increases due to increased erythropoietin production, but not enough to prevent a dilutional anemia from the plasma.There is a 15% drop in Hb.  
The blood viscosity is reduced due to dilution of the increased plasma creating slightly less demand on the heart.  
  
**Platelets** The platelet count tends to remain the same, but the turnover is increased.  
  
**White Blood Cells** There is a steady rise in white cell count peaking during labor. **Plasma Protein** The total concentration of plasma protein is reduced due to dilution from the increase in plasma volume. This results in a decrease in osmotic pressure causing the edema seen with pregnancy.  
  
**Albumin** levels drop to about 35 g/dl.  
  
**Plasma Cholinesterase**  
Plasma cholinesterase levels decrease by about 25% reaching their lowest level at post-partum. It drops even lower with preeclampsia. So a normal dose of succinylcholine may be prolonged.The pharmacokinetics of other protein bound drugs will also be affected.  
Coagulation is affected in pregnancy with an increase in most of the coagulation factors but also an increase in fibrinolytic activity. The result is a somewhat hyper-coagulable state. Thrombo-embolic disease is a very common condition and is one of the most important causes of maternal mortality in developed countries.
