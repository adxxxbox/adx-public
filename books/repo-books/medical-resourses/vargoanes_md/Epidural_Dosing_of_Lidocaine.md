### Epidural Dosing of Lidocaine

_(In OB, commonly used in urgent C-sections)_  
  
During labor, use 0.75% to 1.0% for satisfactory analgesia  
Lidocaine is not commonly used for initiation or maintenance for epidural labor analgesia due to its shorter duration compared to ropivacaine, bupivacaine and levobupivacaine.  
**Duration:** Between 2-chloroprocaine and bupivicaine  
  
**1.5-2% lidocaine  
**1.5-2% concentrations are used for surgical anesthesia  
Most prevalently selected for bolus dosing for urgent C-sections.  
  
Adding Epinephrine 5 mcg/ml (1-200,000) with lidocaine nearly doubles the duration of epidural lidocaine anesthesia. However, Epinephrine is not usually added; it is preferable simply to redose it.Addition of fentanyl will accelerate the onset of analgesia and create a more potent/complete block. For this reason, initially administer 2 ml of fentanyl immediately preceding administration of 2% lidocaine per epidural for urgent C-sections

_With epidurals, Epinephrine is not usually added; it is preferable simply to redose it._  
  
**More Notes  
**Lidocaine is intermediate acting  
It is the prototypical amide local anesthetic  
It is less protein bound than are other amide local anesthetics  
  
At delivery, lidocaine has twice the vein-to-maternal concentration ratio as bupivacaine.  
In the past, epidural lidocaine was associated with abnormal neonatal behavior and fell out of favor for labor epidural. Later studies showed that the other local anesthetics had similar behavior results, and considered subtle.
