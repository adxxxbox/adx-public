### Placenta Abruption Notes and Facts

A serious condition in which the placenta partially or completely prematurely separates after 20 weeks gestation and before birth.  
In acute cases, bleeding results from exposure of shredded vessels because the uterus is unable to selectively constrict the area of abruption. Loss of placental-uterine surface area reduces gas exchange and can result in distressed fetus and/or fetal asphyxia.  
Mild cases may cause few problems  
**Etiology:** Unknown  
**Associated risk factors:** hypertension, preeclampsia, advanced maternal age and parity, maternal and paternal tobacco use, cocaine use, trauma, premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, bleeding in early pregnancy, and a history of previous abruption.  
  
Patients hospitalized for both acute and chronic respiratory diseases are at higher risk for placental abruption.  
  
Abruption complicates 0.4% to 1.0% of pregnancies, and the incidence is increasing, particularly among black women.

Placental abruption happens in about 1 in 150 pregnancies. It's most common in the third trimester but it can happen anytime after 20 weeks.

 Placental abruption is a significant contributor to maternal mortality worldwide.

The effects on the mother depend primarily on the severity of the abruption, while the effects on the fetus depend on both its severity and the gestational age at which it occurs. 

**Classifications of Abruptio Placentae**  
Class 0 - Asymptomatic  
Class 1 - Mild (represents approximately 48% of all cases)  
Class 2 - Moderate (represents approximately 27% of all cases)  
Class 3 - Severe (represents approximately 24% of all cases)  
A diagnosis of class 0 is made retrospectively by finding an organized blood clot or a depressed area on a delivered placenta.

  
**Class 1 characteristics:**  
No vaginal bleeding to mild vaginal bleeding  
Slightly tender uterus  
Normal maternal BP and heart rate  
No coagulopathy  
No fetal distress  
  
**Class 2 characteristics:**  
No vaginal bleeding to moderate vaginal bleeding  
Moderate to severe uterine tenderness with possible tetanic contractions.  
Maternal tachycardia with orthostatic changes in BP and HR.  
Fetal distress  
Hypofibrinogenemia (ie, 50-250 mg/dL)  
  
**Class 3 characteristics:**  
No vaginal bleeding to heavy vaginal bleeding  
Very painful tetanic uterus  
Maternal shock  
Hypofibrinogenemia (ie, < 150 mg/dL)  
Coagulopathy  
Fetal death

**Retroplacental Abruption**: A collection of blood behind the placenta. It can be as much as 3 liters.  
**Subchorionic Abruption:** Subchorionic bleeding with dissection along the chorion.  
  
**Preplacental Abruption:** Blood collection anterior to the placenta within the amnion and the chorion (subamnionic).  
  
**Complications** **Placenta Abruption**  
**Hemorrhage** into the decidua basalis occurs as the placenta separates from the uterus. Vaginal bleeding usually follows, although the presence of a concealed hemorrhage in which the blood pools behind the placenta is possible.  
  
**Hematoma** formation further separates the placenta from the uterine wall, causing compression of these structures and compromise of blood supply to the fetus.

**Most common symptoms:** Bright red third trimester bleeding.  
DIC is a major complication of abruptio placentae.

**Risk factors for Abruptio Placenta are**  
Trauma  
Maternal hypertension  
Placental abruption in previous pregnancy  
Short umbilical cord  
Tobacco use and cocaine abuse  
Folate deficiency
