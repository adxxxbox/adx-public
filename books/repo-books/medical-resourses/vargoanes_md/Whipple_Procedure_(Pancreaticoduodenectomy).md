### Whipple Procedure (Pancreaticoduodenectomy)

**Indication for procedure:** Pancreatic CA (PC).  
_Only about 15-20% of those individuals with pancreatic cancer will be eligible for surgery.  
_The Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy) is typically done for patients who have pancreatic tumors located in the head of the pancreas or in regions adjacent to the head of the pancreas.  
There are a number of variations of the Whipple procedure.   
The procedure may take several hours because the area is anatomically complicated and there may be individual anomalies among the various blood vessels and ducts in the area.  
Unfortunately, even after a pancreatic resection, the 5-year survival rate is only 15%-20%.  
Without surgery, there is a five year survival rate of 5% with PC.  
  
See “Pancreatic cancer notes” at the bottom of this page.  
  
**Whipple procedure** was named after Dr. Allen Whipple. Mortality rate is now only 4%, while it used to be up to 25%. This is the most commonly performed surgery to remove tumors in the pancreas.  
**Standard Whipple:** The surgeon removes the head of the pancreas, the gallbladder, part of the duodenum, which is the uppermost portion of the small intestine, the pylorus of the stomach, and the lymph nodes near the head of the pancreas. The surgeon then reconnects the remaining pancreas and digestive organs so that pancreatic digestive enzymes, bile, and stomach contents will flow into the small intestine during digestion.  
  
**Pylorus Preserving Whipple:** The bottom portion of the stomach, or pylorus, is not removed.  
“Enhanced recovery” or “fast-track” (FT) for these procedures are becoming more popular**Pre-Op Labs:** CBC, BMP, Liver Function, Coags.  
(ECG) should be obtained in any patient with risk factors for coronary artery disease.  
**Type and Cross:** Yes and have 2 units of blood on standby.  
Check to see if the patient has had a bowel prep. The patient may be dry.  
Pancreatitis patients tend to be hypotension and hypovolemic. Use a fluid warmer and warming blanket.  
  
**Preoperative evaluation  
**More than 80% of PCs are diagnosed in patients older than 65 years with comorbidities.  
Many PC patients are or have been heavy smokers, so be aware of increased risk of perioperative pulmonary or cardiac complications.  
Nearly 80% have either frank diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance.  
Diabetics are at increased risk of myocardial ischemia, cerebrovascular infarction and renal ischemia because of their increased incidence of coronary artery disease, arterial atheroma and renal parenchymal disease.   
  
A major common complication of PC patients is venous thromboembolism (VTE).  
Assess for anticoagulation and possible contraindications for an epidural.  
  
**Anesthetic:** Combined general and thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) + A-line.  
Make sure epidural is placed prior to VTE prophylaxis.  
An Epidural (anywhere from T6-11) is common for post op pain management.  
TAP block: Can be administered if there is no epidural placement.  
**Position:** Supine, arms tucked to the side.  
**IV Access:** 2 large bore IVs  
**Central Line with CVP:** not common anymore.  
Avoiding hypervolemia, as well as hypovolemia. Fluid shifts are common on lengthy open abdominal procedures.  
**A-line:** Yes  
**NG Tube:** Yes  
**Nitrous:** No.  
**EBL:** 200-800mLs; depends on the surgeon. One liver surgeon I work with rarely loses more than 200mLs.  
**Duration:** 4-7 hours.  
**Emergence:** Pulmonary recruitment is important with upper abdominal surgery.  
Pulmonary complications following pancreatic resection occur in approximately 25% of all patients.  
**  
Consider awake extubation for:**  
Patients with advanced age  
Received a lot of volume.  
Cases of long duration.  
  
**Post op:  
**Obtain optimal glucose level during the perioperative period.  
  
**Possible postoperative complications**  
Delayed gastric emptying- usually 7-10 days the stomach begins to work properly.  
Primarily pancreatic fistula  
Bowel leakage from the anastomosis  
Hemorrhage  
Abscess  
Delayed gastric emptying  
Pneumonia  
Failure to wean  
Post-extubation respiratory failure represent  
Mortality rate of 1% to 5%.  
  
**Patients with** **pulmonary disease:** Account for 40% postoperative complications and 20% of deaths.  
  
**Pancreatogenic Diabetes  
**Following pancreatectomy, insulin receptors are upregulated peripherally, rendering patients more sensitive to insulin.  
This diabetic state referred to as “brittle.”  
The patient is more prone to both hyper and hypoglycemia.
