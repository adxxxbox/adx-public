Ventriculo-Peritoneal (VP Shunt) Revision   

### Ventriculo - Peritoneal (VP Shunt)

**Alternative shunts:  
**VA = Ventriculo-Atrial Shunt  
VP = Ventriculo-Pleural Shunt

**Age range:** premature neonates to post puberty children.  
**Surgical Procedure**  
VP shunt surgery treats hydrocephalus, an increased volume of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). The increased CSF volume in the ventricles creates a decrease in cerebral compliance. Eventually, hydrocephalus causes a decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) accompanied by an increase in intracerebral pressure (ICP).

To drain the over supply of CSF, a thin catheter with a one-way valve is inserted into the brain's lateral ventricle and tunneled into the peritoneum, or, less commonly the atrium or pleural space. It drains excess CSF from the ventricles to a site for absorption.  
Most commonly, the surgeon makes a small incision in the right parietal area (behind the right ear), but for certain conditions, the left parietal, frontal or endoscopic approach may be used. The surgeon will often infiltrate with local anesthetic with epinephrine for the scalp incision. A skull hole is made, and a small catheter is passed into a ventricle of the brain.

  
A small abdominal incision is made into the rectus abdominal sheath for access to the peritoneum. The catheter is then tunneled distally under the skin and subcutaneous tissue from behind the ear, under the fascia in the neck to the peritoneal space. A small neck incision is often made to guide tunneling of the shunt catheter.

The valve is connected to the distal and proximal catheters. When excess pressure builds up the valve opens, and fluid drains through the shunt into the peritoneal cavity or atrium, where it is resorbed. This helps decrease intracranial pressure. The valves can be pressure adjusted.  
**  
Pre-op**  
VP shunt patients may be infants or at any stage of childhood, therefore developmental considerations apply.

It is important when making your plan that you determine from the surgical team which side will be used and set up your equipment appropriately. The patients may take anticonvulsant medications or steroids, which might influence anesthetic care, and generally should be continued perioperatively. If the patient has had an external drainage device inserted at the bedside the height of the drainage bag should not be altered in transport or during induction.

ICP may be elevated or it may be normal. Even in the face of resting normal ICP hydrocephalus occupies IC space and thus decreases the autoregulatory ability to adjust to any volume change (increased CO2, position change, cough, etc) that can further increase ICP. Minimizing increases in ICP should be the cornerstone of care. Although this generally means avoiding sedation, for an agitated child it might be needed. The anesthetist should be in attendance and available to monitor if any sedation is used.

Pathophysiology can include intra cerebral bleed, congenital CSF blockage, or intracranial tumors. Check for baseline neuro function, underlying co morbidities and acute issues such as hyperventilation in response to ICP increase, bulging fontanelles, and the effect of head circumference on positioning for airway management. If the child is being maintained in a head up position this should be continued until ventilation is controlled. Pre-op electrolytes and CBC are generally available and need to be checked. Pre-incision prophylactic antibiotic is indicated.

**Pre Medication:** None, or judicious and monitored small doses of midazalam. If the child does not have an IV, EMLA application to several sites may ease insertion and avoid excitement.

**Anesthetic:** General/oral ETT with the head slightly elevated. If you use an uncuffed ETT, make sure it fits sufficiently to provide adequate controlled ventilation.

Literature states that TIVA is preferred until the cranium is open. Halogenated agents may increase ICP.  
Most CRNAs still use Sevoflurane and the patients do fine.  
  
**Nitrous Oxide:** Avoid

**IV:** Many children will arrive with a functioning IV. If not, insert a small IV in any extremity. You will also have access to the feet during the case.

**Arterial line:** Usually not needed, unless there is a severely elevated ICP or metabolic derangements present.  
  
**Induction:** IV induction is popular to avoid increases in ICP that can occur with inhalation agents, breath holding and laryngospasm.  
  
**Induction/intubation goal:** Avoid coughing, therefore adequate dosing and appropriate timing are important.  
  
**Intubation**  
In some cases, especially with open fontanels the head circumference may be dramatically enlarged making positioning for airway management difficult. I have intubated with a colleague suspending the head off the end of the bed, or had to turn the head to the side for laryngoscopy.

**Ventilation:** Maintain normocapnia or mild hypocapnia (ETCO2 30-35mmHg) until the cranium is open to help maintain cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). Do not over hyperventilate the patient because it may become difficult to cannulate the ventricle if it is empty from hyperventilation.

**Position:** Supine, arms to the side. Usually the head is slightly elevated and turned to the contralateral side of the shunt insertion. You may not have access to the ipsilateral arm. Sometimes a shoulder roll will be used. Neck flexion and head movement for positioning, may cause the ETT to migrate into the right main stem or to kink. Watch peak inspiratory pressures. Recheck breath sounds after positioning. The bed is usually rotated 90 degrees, so make sure your ventilator tubing, IV tubing and other cords are long enough and out of the way, usually on the patient’s left side. Lower extremities can also be used for monitors and IV.

**Monitors:** Standard Monitors. Place EKG leads on the patient’s back because portions of the chest are prepped.

**Maintenance:** Inhalation agents up to 1 MAC or TIVA of choice.  
(I like propofol, remifentanil or dexmedetomidine) after controlled ventilation is established. Which ever you chose, maintain normal or slightly below ETCO2.  
  
**IV acetaminophen:** can be used for analgesia. The surgeon generally injects all incisions with local +/- epinephrine.

**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**EBL:** minimal

**Hydration:** 4:2:1(Avoid hypotonic solutions) Lactated ringers at maintenance infusion rate, adjusted for fasting, any blood loss and fluid loss from vomiting. For neonates, addition of a glucose solution can be considered, but is not the norm, unless there is a history of hypoglycemia.

Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**A-Line:** Not needed

  
**Emergence:** Reverse non-depolarizing blockers if indicated. Either deep extubation, if you are confident of you ability to manage the airway, or wide awake and calm. IV lidocaine at 1 mg/kg may help to suppress coughing. ICP should be less of a concern post functioning shunt, but these children may still have neuro-pathology that merits avoiding any maneuvers that may increase ICP, or cause excessive CSF loss (deep sedation, coughing, agitation, head down, etc).

**More Notes**

**My advice: _This case may be urgent but is not an emergency_.** Do communicate with the surgeon so you can make your plan and share concerns. Don't lose site of the pathology and keep the child calm.  
  
I always start a pre-op IV, and it might only be a 22g. If that means delaying start till EMLA has effect I make them wait.  
  
I monitor these kids in preoperatively.  
  
The saphenous vein can be the best choice for IV. An awake child can't see what I am doing, and distraction works well if a colleague or parent engages them. The IV can be changed intra op if the patient is ambulatory or larger access is desired.  
  
For babies, I usually intubate with only propofol, 3mg/kg, but older kids get cisatracurium or rocuronium. I usually don't wait for muscle relaxant peak effect to intubate. My goal is to gain airway control as quickly as possible. Be sure you have given enough meds and the timing is right, to blunt coughing on the ETT.

During maintenance remember **_you generally get in the most trouble with_** _**light anesthesia in peds**_. Ask the surgeon to give you a 5-minute warning before tunneling so you can deepen the anesthetic. Generally there is little post-op pain with surgical local infiltration. IV acetaminophen (or acetaminophen suppository) is appropriate as the only analgesic.  
  
Small doses of narcotics may be used judiciously in PACU. I generally give ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg prophylactically.
