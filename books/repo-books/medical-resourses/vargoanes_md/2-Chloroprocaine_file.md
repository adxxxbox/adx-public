### 2-Chloroprocaine (Nesacaine) in Neuraxial OB

**_Class:_** _An Ester type Local Anesthetic, short-acting  
_Quick onset and short-acting.  
Do not use with plasma Pseudocholinesterase deficiency or hepatic disease.\- In OB, the only time we will ever use 2% or 3% Chloroprocaine is for an urgent C-section for patients who have a previously placed epidural.  
\- Obstetric Anesthesia textbooks will all mention that NaHCO3 can be added to it (or added to Lidocaine) to quicken the onset.  
  
\- Realistically, 2% Lidocaine is far more commonly administered per epidural for urgent C-sections than 3% Chloroprocaine.  
\- NaHCO3 is rarely added to quicken the onset.  
**Epidural Dose:  
**\- 10mL of 2% 2-Chloroprocaine provides adequate analgesia for 45-60 minutes.  
\- 2% 2-Chloroprocaine for analgesia (when muscle relaxation is not needed)  
\- 3% 2-Chloroprocaine for analgesia and muscle relaxation  
\- Redose every 30 minutes for surgical anesthesia  
  
Chloroprocaine usually needs rebolusing of epidural catheters every 30 minutes.

_With epidurals, we usually do not add epinephrine to a local anesthetic to increase duration because we can redose it.

**Difference between Procaine and Chloroprocaine:**  
\- A chlorine atom is added to the benzene ring of Procaine, and it becomes Chloroprocaine.  
\- Hydrolyzed four times faster than Procaine by plasma cholinesterase.  
**Drawbacks**  
Chloroprocaine may interfere with the action of epidurally administered opioids because it antagonizes μ- and κ-opioid receptors.

**The two ways you could tell that Chloroprocaine is an amide are:**  
\- Chloroprocaine only has one “I” in the drug name.  
\- It has a C=O bond connected to the aromatic ring.  
\- An Ester has an NH group connected to the aromatic ring.  
  
Chloroprocaine has a relative potency of 1 on an arbitrary scale of 1 - 6.  
Chloroprocaine is fast in onset despite its high pKa; probably because at 3%, it has far more molecules to diffuse the nerve than the other lower concentrated local anesthetics.  
  
**Epidural:** 2-3%  
**Onset:** 6 minutes  
**Duration:** 30-60 mins  
**Max Dose:** w/o Epi: 800mg (or 10mg/kg)  
**Max Dose:** with Epi: 1,000mg  
**Infiltration:** 1%  
**Onset:** Fast  
**Duration:** 30-60 mins  
**Max Dose:** w/o Epi: 800mg  
**Max Dose:** w/ Epi: 1,000mg  
**Peripheral Nerve Block:** 2%  
**Onset:** Fast  
**Duration:** 30-60 mins  
**Max Dose:** w/o Epi: 800mg  
**Max Dose:** with Epi: 1,000mg  
**Spinal:** 2-3% (Not used a spinal in OB)  
**Onset:** Fast  
**Duration:** 30-60 min  
  
**Mechanism of action:** Like other local anesthetics, it binds to the intracellular portion of sodium channels and blocks sodium influx into nerve cells, which prevents depolarization.  
**pKa:** 8.9  
  
**Metabolism:  
\-** Hydrolyzed rapidly by plasma Pseudocholinesterase to 2-chloro-4-aminobenzoic acid and 8-diethylaminoethanol (80% conjugated before elimination).  
\- Pregnant women have 30-40% less plasma Pseudocholinesterase activity.  
\- The para-aminobenzoic acid metabolite of chloroprocaine inhibits the action of sulfonamides.  
\- Therefore, chloroprocaine should not be used in any condition in which a sulfonamide drug is employed.  
  
**Metabolite:** PABA  
**Half-Life:** 22 seconds > than 1 minute in pregnant women.  
\- The para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) metabolite of chloroprocaine inhibits the action of sulfonamides.  
\- Therefore, chloroprocaine should not be used in any condition in which a sulfonamide drug is employed.  
  
**Excretion:  
**Urine - minimal as unchanged drug in urine.  
  
**Metabolites:** Metabolites excreted unchanged.  
  
**Manifestations to watch for:**  
Euphoria  
Dizziness  
Tinnitus  
Twitching  
Tremors  
Convulsions  
Hypotension  
Cardiac Arrest
