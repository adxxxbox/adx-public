### Cardiovascular Changes During Labor

**First stage of labor:** Increase CO by 34% during contractions and 11% between contractions. This is mainly from the uterus expelling as much as 500 mLs of blood into maternal circulation during contraction.  
  
**Second stage of labor:** Increase in CO by 50%  
  
**Immediately after delivery:** Increase by 60-80%  
  
**Postpartum**: Within 10 minutes of delivery, starts to decrease back to normal within 24 hours.
