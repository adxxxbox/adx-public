### A vasoconstrictor always right after CPB?

Vasodilatation following CPB is thought to be secondary to the inflammatory response associated with surgery and the CPB. The patient can still have a very contractile heart, but will be unable to maintain an adequate BP due the common vasodilatation. These patients are always treated with a vasoconstrictor. Phenylephrine is the starting vasoconstrictor of choice.
