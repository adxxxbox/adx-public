### Amicar

**Amicar for the treatment option of a bleeding anticoagulated patient  
**Amicar is a antifibrinolytic drug which prevents the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin – preventing clot breakdown.  
  
A newer antifibrinolytic drug - **tranexamic acid (TXA)** is 10 times stronger than Amicar _(Mannucci 1998)._  
  
**Amicar as a reversal to TPAs and Urokinase**  
Amicar may be considered as a reversal option for TPA and urokinase.  
Minimal literature is noted.  
Recommended dose is 5 gm IV over 1 hour, then 1 gram/hour infusion.  
The reference guideline also stated that efficacy has not been established.  
The guideline is from 2013, when TXA was not as popular as it is now.
