EGD removal of foreign body (rigid or flexible)   

### EGD removal of foreign body (rigid or flexible) for a Pediatric Patient

  
_By John Martin Kramer, CRNA, Novant Health, Charlotte, NC_

**Short summary of the surgical procedure**  
An esophageal foreign body or food impaction should be removed within 24 hours to increase the chance of successful removal and decrease the chances of perforation, transmural erosion, and fistula formation. For this procedure, either a rigid or flexible esophagoscopy is performed for the removal of a foreign body. A rigid esophagoscopy is normally performed by a pediatric general surgeon while a flexible bronchoscopy can be performed by either a pediatric general surgeon or a pediatric endoscopist.

**Short summary describing the anesthesia:**  
The anesthetic for this type of case is basically the same as the one used for a pediatric EGD except for the fact that the patient will probably not be NPO, so general endotracheal tube anesthetic is preferred over deep sedation, to decrease the chances of aspiration.  
  
For a flexible esophagoscopy, the patient will be transported to the operating room after receiving a preoperative sedative usually IV midazolam 0.5-2 mg IV. Once in the OR, monitors are placed and RSI is performed followed by placement of ETT.  
  
Once the ETT is secured, a bite block is place if a flexible esophagoscopy is being performed. If however a rigid esophagoscopy is the choice for removal of the foreign body then no bite block is necessary.

**Indications of the procedure:**  
Esophageal foreign body or food impaction

**Pre-op and what to prepare. What you need to find out? Ex.**  
In addition to preforming your normal preoperative assessment you want to determine, if possible, what the foreign body is and how long it has been lodged. Knowing this can prepare you for the length of the procedure as well as the possibility of esophageal erosion or fistula.

**Case preparation** includes preparing your normal emergency drugs for pediatric cases:  
Succinylcholine  
Atropine  
ETTs  
Suction  
Additionally, you will need to draw-up your premedication for the child.

**Anesthetic:** GETA  
  
**Airway issues:** Normal pediatric airway issues, large tongue, big head, possibility of gastric secretions as well.**Regional-Caudal:** N/A

**Induction:** RSI**Nitrous: +/-  
Muscle Relaxation:** Normally not needed, will need if perforation has occurred.**Position** : Supine  
**Duration:** 15 minutes - 1 hour  
**EBL:** < 10 ml**Blood Bolus dose:** 10-20cc/kg if needed.  
**IV Access:** 22 gauge is sufficient

**Hydration: 4:2:1** **(below is just a common reference)**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**A-line:** N/A**Age Range:** 6 months - 6 years**Foley Catheter:** N/A unless perforation

**Emergence:  
**Emergence is usually smooth as the patient has had very little anesthetic which can lead to emergence delirium. Additionally, the patient has been breathing spontaneously; however, since this is considered a general anesthetic you always need to be aware of phase two and the possibility of laryngospasm from saliva or lubrication jelly they may have fallen off the endoscope.**  
  
Possible Complications:  
**Possible complications include damage to teeth or gums if intubation is required as well as a sore throat. Aspiration is always a possible complication when giving a general anesthetic especially since the airway is not secured and propofol decreases muscle tone

in the lower esophageal sphincter. Esophageal perforation is possible during removal of object and increases secondary to the length of time the object has been lodged.

**More Notes**  
Do not attempt to dislodge a foreign body from a spontaneously breathing patient by giving abdominal thrusts or syrup of ipecac.

Bronchodilators and corticosteroids should not be used to remove the foreign body, and chest physical therapy with postural drainage may dislodge the material to an area where it may cause more harm, such as at the level of the vocal cords.

The majority of ingested foreign bodies will pass spontaneously.

More than 80% of foreign objects will likely pass without the need for intervention

For intentional ingestions, the rate of endoscopic intervention may be much higher (63%- 76%) and the need for surgical intervention ranges from 12% to 16%

The majority of foreign body ingestions occur in the pediatric population, with a peak incidence between the ages of 6 months and 6 years.

In adults, true foreign body ingestion (nonfood objects) occurs more commonly in those with psychiatric disorders, develop- mental delay, alcohol intoxication, and in incarcerated individuals seeking secondary gain via release to a medical facility

Young children, mentally impaired adults, and those with psychiatric illness may thus present with choking, refusal to eat, vomiting, drooling, wheezing, blood-stained saliva, or respiratory distress.

Oropharyngeal or proximal esophageal perforation can cause neck swelling, erythema, tenderness, or crepitus. Clinicians must also evaluate for peritonitis or small-bowel obstruction.

Esophageal foreign objects and food impactions should be removed within 24 hours because delay decreases the likelihood of successful removal and increases the risk of complications including risk of perforation.

In children, the duration of the foreign body in the esophagus may be unknown. Some advocate urgent removal in this population because transmural erosion, fistula formation, and other complications can occur.

Once the foreign body has entered the stomach, most objects pass in 4 to 6 days.

**Retrieval devices.** Various retrieval devices have been used, including:  
Rat-tooth and alligator forceps  
Polypectomy snares,|  
Polyp graspers  
Dormier baskets,  
Retrieval nets,  
Magnetic probes  
Friction-fit adaptors or banding caps

Before endoscopy, practicing grasping a similar object to the ingested foreign body may help determine the most appropriate available retrieval device and in what fashion to grasp the object.

The most common esophageal foreign body in adults in the Western world is impacted meat or other food

However, caution is warranted after prolonged impaction or if eosinophilic esophagitis is suspected.

**Glucagon.** In the setting of an impacted esophageal food bolus, the administration of glucagon 1.0 mg intravenously has been advocated to induce relaxation of the distal esophagus, thereby allowing spontaneous bolus passage while endoscopic therapy is coordinated.

**Disk batteries.** Special considerations apply to small disk or button battery ingestion

Children younger than 5 years of age are the most likely to ingest a button battery, and most ingested batteries are from hearing aids, watches, games, toys, and calculators.

Liquefaction necrosis and perforation can occur rapidly when a disk battery is lodged in the esophagus, leading to severe and potentially fatal complications.

After radiographic documentation, batteries lodged in the esophagus should be emergently removed. Use of a stone retrieval basket or ~a~ retrieval net is most often successful

If the battery cannot be directly retrieved from the esophagus, it should be pushed into the stomach where it can often be successfully retrieved with a basket or net. However, once in the stomach, most disk batteries pass without complications. Batteries that have passed beyond the esophagus need not be retrieved unless the patient has signs of injury to the gastrointestinal tract.

Once past the duodenum, 85% pass out of the body within 72 hours.

**Coins.** Ingestion of coins occurs most commonly in young children. If coins become lodged within the esophagus, they can be observed for 12 to 24 hours if the patient is asymptomatic because they will commonly pass spontaneously.

Patients with marked symptoms including drooling, chest pain, and stridor should have emergent intervention to remove the coin. Coins in the distal esophagus are more likely to pass spontaneously than those in the proximal esophagus.

Most coins will eventually leave the stomach and pass through the GI tract without obstruction. Serial radio- graphs should be obtained as with other objects undergoing conservative management. Zinc toxicity has been reported with massive ingestion of pennies minted after 1982.
