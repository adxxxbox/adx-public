Symptoms of Anaphylaxis    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Anaphylaxis Symptoms

Recognition of anaphylaxis during anesthesia is usually delayed because the **_hypotension and bronchospasm_** more commonly have a different cause.

Initial management of anaphylaxis should follow the ABC approach. Adrenaline (epinephrine) is the most effective drug in anaphylaxis and should be given as early as possible.

Can range from mild reactions to severe anaphylactic shock and death.

**Skin**  
Flushing  
Urticarial (hives)  
Diaphorisis

**Cardiac (Cardiac Collapse)  
**Severe HypotensionTachycardia (and/or other dysrhythmias)  
MI  
Cardiac arrest  
**  
Kounis Syndrome:** (Allergic Angina or allergic myocardial infarction):  
Triggered by the release of inflammatory mediators following an allergic reaction. An acute coronary syndrome may lead to “Allergic Angina and MI.

**Airway**  
Wheezing (bronchospasm)  
Laryngeal edema  
Dropping oxygen saturations  
  
**Other**  
Decreased renal output with acute tubular necrosis  
DIC

**Urticarial (hives) from Histamine Release with Induction  
**If your patient’s skin becomes flush or develops urticaria with induction, do NOT panic. Almost all the occurrences are from a non-immunological histamine release. It is caused by the direct action of a drug on mast cells.  
Anesthetic drugs that release histamine directly include atracurium, mivacurium, morphine and meperidine.  
Cutaneous histamine release occurs in up to 30% of patients during anesthesia. The reaction may occur seconds to 2 hours after the exposure. (Average is 20 minutes).  
If the Urticaria is not transient, a small dose of Benadryl is commonly administered.
