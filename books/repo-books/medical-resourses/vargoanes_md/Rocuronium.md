**Introduced in 1994:** Roc was developed in the early 1990s as a safer and more manageable alternative to older paralytics like pancuronium.

An alternative to Sux for RSI:

-   Due to Sux problematic side effects and multiple contraindications, roc has increasingly replaced Sux as the paralytic of choice for rapid sequence induction.
-   With the availability of sugammadex for rapid reversal, the duration difference is less of a concern than it once was.
-   A vial of sugammadex should always be readily available in case there is a “can’t intubate, can’t ventilate” situation when a quick reversal is needed.
-   The RSI dose of roc is 1.2 mg/kg with an onset of 90 seconds.

**The priming technique,**in which a small dose of nondepolarizing muscle relaxant is administered 3–6 minutes before giving the intubation dose, can speed up the onset of muscle relaxation in patients with paralysis during intubation.

Realistically, anesthesia providers do not wait 3-6 minutes before giving the intubation dose.

Precurarization:

-   An anesthetic technique involving the administration of a small, non-paralyzing dose (priming dose) with a NDMB prior to administering the intended muscle relaxant dose.
-   10% of the normal induction dose of the NDMB for muscle relaxion is the common precurarization dose.

Example:

**Priming (precurarization: dose)** of rocuronium is 0.06 mg/kg.

**Induction dose** of rocuronium for muscle relaxation is 0.6 mg/kg

Possible goals/results of precurarization:

Preventing fasciculations:

-   SCh is known to cause involuntary muscle contractions, or fasciculations, right before muscle paralysis sets in.
-   Precurarization works by occupying some of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction.
-   This partial blockade prevents the widespread, simultaneous muscle contractions that cause fasciculations.

Reducing post-operative myalgia (muscle pain):

-   The violent, involuntary fasciculations can lead to myalgia after surgery.
-   By blocking the fasciculations, precurarization also reduces the incidence and severity of this muscle soreness.

Reduction of succinylcholine-induced hyperkalemia:

-   In normal individuals, the increase in serum K+ is approximately 0.5–1.0 mEq/L, occurs within 3–5 minutes after the IV administration of Sux, and lasts less than 10–15 minutes.
-   Some studies have shown that the administration of 0.6 mg/kg (10% of induction dose) of rocuronium prior to the administration of SUX has resulted in LESS elevation of serum potassium.
-   This is not a common practice and is still controversial, requiring more research.

Cross-reaction between Roc and repeated exposure to hair products by hairdressers.

Can a patient have an allergic reaction with their first exposure to Roc?

**Answer:** Yes

-   An allergic reaction from the first exposure to Roc would suggest a prior sensitization to a compound within rocuronium.
-   Hairdressers are routinely exposed to a wide range of hair products containing the quaternary ammonium compound.
-   This repeated exposure to quaternary ammonium compounds can lead to the development of IgE antibodies specific.
-   Roc contains a quaternary ammonium group.
-   After the administration of rocuronium, the quaternary ammonium can act as an antigenic epitope, triggering an immune response in sensitized individuals and possibly an anaphylactic reaction.
-   One study showed that 7.4% of hairdressers had IgE antibodies to quaternary ammonium, compared to only 1.6% of non-hairdressing apprentices

Drug Admixture Incompatibility:

Roc should not be mixed with alkaline solutions.

Roc is physically incompatible when mixed with the following drugs:

-   dexamethasone
-   ketorolac
-   cefazolin
-   lorazepam
-   diazepam
-   methylprednisolone
-   thiopental
-   amphotericin
-   hydrocortisone
-   sodium succinate
-   amoxicillin
-   insulin
-   azathioprine intralipid
-   cloxacillin
-   methohexital
-   erythromycin
-   famotidine
-   trimethoprim

Factors that increase the duration of Roc and other NDMBs:

-   Cardiac antidysrhythmic drugs
-   Diuretics
-   Local anesthetics-amides
-   HYPOkalemia
-   Respiratory acidosis
-   Hypothermia
-   Ca channel blockers
-   Ketamine
-   Lithium
-   Immunosuppressants
-   Hepatic disease
-   Neuromuscular diseases

Factors that can decrease the duration of Roc and other NDMBs:

-   Increased plasma levels of pseudocholinesterase (butyrylcholinesterase)
-   Obesity (increased volume of distribution)
-   HYPERkalemia
-   Alkalosis
-   Inflammation
-   Cancer and its treatments
-   Burns > 30%- from upregulation of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs)
-   Prolonged immobility, from upregulation of AChRs
-   Aminophylline
-   Steroids
-   Dilantin (phenytoin)
-   CVA- from upregulation of AChRs
