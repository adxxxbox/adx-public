### Phaco with IOL

**(Phacoemulsification and Intraocular Lens Implantation)**

**Phacoemulsification:** The eye's internal lens is emulsified with an ultrasonic hand piece and aspirated from the lens sac. 

**Intraocular Lens Implantation:** After the old cloudy lens is emulsified and removed, an artificial intraocular lens (IOL) is inserted into the lens sac. Most IOLs are made of a flexible, foldable material and are about one-fifth of the size of a dime.  Like the lenses of prescription eyeglasses, the IOL will contain the appropriate prescription for the patient.   
**Anesthetic:** Usually a MAC (MD will use topical drops or a subconjunctival injection).  
2mg of versed and 100mcgs of Fentanyl is common. Consider 15-30mg of Toradol. Since the anterior chamber is avascular, Toradol is entirely acceptable here as opposed to a posterior chamber procedure like a vitrectomy. The posterior chamber is highly vascular.

Some old school eye docs still use the retrobulbar block.  
**Position:** Supine with arms tucked and the patient remains on the same stretcher. Make sure the ETCO2 NC is looped away from the surgical eye. The stretcher is parked 90-180 degrees away from you (unless you are starting out as a general).  
**IV Access**: 22G is acceptable. A 500mL NS bag with micro drip tubing is popular.  
**EBL**: Minimal  
**Duration:** 15-40 minutes. Depends on the surgeon.  
**Diagnosis:** Cataract

Many of these patients are very old.  Avoid Versed with Alzheimer’s patients.
