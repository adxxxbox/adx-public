### CSE - Intro and Review

_By Lisa Stiel Moreno_

**A Combined Spinal-Epidural (CSE) is exactly what the title says.**  
_You are combining a spinal with an epidural_ .  
  
CSE is the best technique for labor analgesia and other uses such as anticipated difficult  
C- section, for multiple reasons which extend well beyond quick onset. It is well supported to use the technique in practically all laboring patients, in early or late labor, except in the few cases where a spinal should be avoided. For such a relatively simple technique, the benefits of CSE are tremendous.  
  
The combination of CSE and PCEA is the best approach to labor analgesia and decreased anesthesia manpower requirements.  
  
In the past, CSE were only reserved for parturients very late in labor or who were very uncomfortable.  
Now CSEs are now more commonly used, even in early labor.  
  
**Brief Step by Step  
**One first inserts an epidural needle in the epidural space  
then inserts a spinal needle through the epidural needle  
then advances the spinal needle a tiny bit to enter the subarachnoid space  
then injects a spinal dose (narcotic or LA or both) for immediate pain relief  
then removes the spinal needle  
then threads an epidural catheter through the epidural needle into the epidural space  
then secures the epidural catheter.  
  
The patient now has immediate pain relief from the spinal and an epidural catheter is in place for continuous infusion and supplemental doses when needed.  
  
**Onset of complete analgesia:  
CSE:** 2-5 minutes (from the spinal dose)  
**Epidural:** 10-15 minutes  
  
The onset of sacral analgesia (S2-S4) seen in the 2 nd phase of labor may take hours with an epidural, but minutes with a spinal.  
  
There are many techniques to perform a CSE. The “needle-through-needle” or coaxial technique is the most common.  
  
In OB, the epidural is the mainstay and usually the best choice for pain control in our laboring patients.  
Spinals are the anesthetic of choice for most C-Sections.  
  
**Indications:  
**A precipitous delivery (labor and delivery < 3 hours) with possible tubal ligation.Possible prolonged C-section with or without potential complications such as: Accretas or  
multiple previous abdominal surgeries with suspected adhesions or a  
very slow surgeon.Possible post-delivery pain-chronic pain patient: when you suspect difficulties in controlling post- operative pain.  
Most OB anesthesia providers perform their spinals with hyperbaric bupivacaine and a narcotic.  
  
**CSE and C-Sections  
**Additionally, the CSE may be used for a C-section, where the CSE surgical spinal dose administered alone should cover most C-sections via a dense block. Sometimes a C-section will last longer than the duration of the spinal dose administered and the patient will start to experience sharp surgical pain. The epidural catheter is still in place can be dosed appropriately to cover the pain.  
Even with long acting agents and vasoconstrictors, a complicated case can outlast the spinal.  
  
What about a straight lumbar epidural?  
  
**Factors that may prolong the duration of a C-section**  
Patient with a history of multiple repeat sections-having excess scar tissue  
Added bilateral Tubal Ligation procedure  
A very slow surgeon or resident  
  
**CSE Spinal Dose For C-section  
**Some anesthesia providers administer 10-12mg of 0.75% bupivacaine with either Duramorph preservative-free morphine, hydromorphone or fentanyl.  
  
**CSE Spinal Dose for Labor Analgesia**  
1 ml (2.5 mg) of 0.25% bupivacaine and fentanyl 10mcg (0.2 ml) is common.  
  
**The CSE spinal dose above is an excellent choice for**  
(1) the very uncomfortable parturient with an advanced dilatation (>7 cm)  
(2) the multiparous parturient at 4-5 cm with an anticipated delivery within a couple of hours or  
(3) almost any parturient, even very early in labor, for reasons explained below.  
  
**Ephedrine for hypotension:** Have ephedrine readily available after CSE placement, as parturients can experience a significant drop in blood pressure.  
  
**Common Narcotic Spinal Doses for CSE** Duramorph (PF morphine): 0.15mg-0.3mg **(spinal onset** : 30-60 minutes, **Duration:** 6-24 hours)  
Fentanyl: 25 mcg: **(Spinal onset:** 5-15 minutes, **Duration** : 2-4 hours)  
  
Dilaudid : 20-100 mcg **Spinal Onset:** quicker than Morphine, **Duration:** Longer than Fentanyl)If the spinal will be used for labor analgesia, then dosages decrease significantly. If using for labor, I give only fentanyl, usually 12.5-25mcg depending on my mood.  
**  
Spinal Doses for rapidly progressing labor  
**For patients who are progressing rapidly through labor can be plain local anesthetic, plain narcotic or a combination.  
  
A narcotic administered alone is usually not enough, but a local anesthetic can be used alone.  
I usually administer 3.75-4.5mg of 0.75% Marcaine.  
I use 2.5mg of Marcaine for delivery  
  
**_Remember_** _: For the patients who will be delivering soon, they will need to maintain the ability to push the baby out. No OB MD will thank you for prolonging their deliveries. It is a fine line, and sometimes it’s best to err on the side of some discomfort rather than risk patient immobility.  
  
_**You can redose with the epidural catheter in place** Having the epidural allows for redosing if the C-section or procedure goes longer than the duration of the spinal dose coverage.  
  
**Be careful with the epidural dosing - you may get a higher block  
**Redosing an epidural that was placed during a CSE must be done judiciously.  
A normal epidural dose with a CSE may give you a higher dermatome level as compared to a basic epidural dose without a previous spinal dose with an CSE.  
  
**Example:** With a regular epidural (not CSE) we normally administer 5ml of Lidocaine 2%. This would give a predictable slight raise in the epidural block. With the same epidural dose with a CSE, you may get more of an elevation in the level than you intended.  
Remember there is still a small puncture in the dura from your spinal, and that may permit the epidural local anesthetic to migrate into the subarachnoid space.  
  
**PCEA can be used for post op pain control** Unfortunately, substance abuse is a real problem in the obstetric population.  
In my experience, substance abusers have a higher incidence of C-sections. This means that you now have to manage post-operative pain on a non-opiate naive individual. Performing a CSE will provide a non-opiate method of pain control for this population.  
  
**Spinal vs Epidural - why we perform the spinal  
**A surgical-level block is established more quickly, and a spinal block tends to be denser and more evenly distributed than a straight epidural block. Furthermore, the time required for placement of a CSE is not significantly increased over a straight epidural. In fact, perhaps the only reasons it wouldn’t be better would be if the risks/side effects were greater for CSE, or it were a case where a spinal anesthetic is best avoided. Let us explore these considerations.
