Pyloromyotomy vs Pyloroplasty   

### Pyloromyotomy vs Pyloroplasty

**Pyloromyotomy** suppresses the state of abnormal excitation of the pylorus, resulting in a decrease of contraction pressure when the incision is made long enough. It reduces the contractile force of the circular muscle at the pyloric region while maintaining the sphincter function and widening the lumen. The procedure is preferred when preservation of the sphincter function of the pylorus is desirable and decreased drainage is sufficient.

**Pyeloroplasty** (after Heineke-Mikulics) is more effective as a drainage operation. It sacrifices the sphincter muscle of the pylorus and widens its lumen to result in a greater drainage effect. It is indicated when severe excitation of the remaining pyloric portion is present and a powerful drainage effect is desired, but sacrifices the sphincter muscle function of the pylorus.
