### Convergent (or convergence) Procedure Anesthesia

(Subxiphoid minimally invasive epicardial ablation)Also, refer to “Convergent Procedure” for more details.\- The convergent procedure is a minimally invasive heart surgery to perform an epicardial left atrial ablation to treat persistent atrial fibrillation.  
\- This procedure is performed by both a cardiothoracic surgeon and an electrophysiologist.  
  
**\- A Thoracoscopic** **Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Ligation or Clipping** is sometimes performed with the convergent procedure.  
\- The **Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Ligation or Clipping** is challenging for anesthesia providers due to occasional severe drops in BP with chest insufflation.  
  
\- All patients received a regimen consisting of steroids, colchicine, and NSAID medications to combat the expected pericarditis.  
\- It is good to have these medications accessible when needed.  
  
\- There is no standard anesthesia plan for this procedure as it is based on the information forwarded by experienced anesthesia providers who have managed this procedure at various institutions.  
\- Always collaborate with the surgeon.  
  
**Fluids:**  
\- Keep the patient on the dry side.  
\- Overhydration may over-distend the right atrium, thus limiting pericardial access.  
  
**Note:** The anesthesia management for the convergence procedure alone (without LAA Ligation or Clipping) is similar to the traditional left atrial ablation procedure performed in the EP lab, except heparin is not needed.  
**Anesthesia management (without LAA Ligation or Clipping):  
General anesthesia:** ETT  
**\- 2 IVs**  
**\- Aline  
\- Pacer pads** on and ready  
**\- Position:** Supine, arms tucked  
**\- Esophageal temp probe:** Inform the surgeon of temperature increases with ablation.  
\- The pericardial and pleural drains were removed when the output fell below 75 mL for 24 hours.  
**\- Foley:** Yes  
**\- Duration:** around 5 hours  
**\- EBL:** Minimal  
  
**Possible complications/side effects:  
**\- Pericarditis  
\- Pericardial effusion  
\- Cardiac tamponade  
\- Phrenic nerve palsy  
\- Stroke  
\- Chest discomfort  
\- Shortness of breath  
\- Fluid retention  
  
**Post-op:  
**\- Pericardial Blake and/or pleural drains will be removed when the output  
falls below 75 mL for a 24-hour period.  
\- All preoperative antiarrhythmic medications and anticoagulants may be resumed prior to discharge.
