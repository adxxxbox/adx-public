### Impella Left Ventricular Assist Device Insertion

Refer to “Impella Left Ventricular Assist Device” for more information.

**2 possible operating room settings for this procedure**

1) Returning to the cardiac operating room post bypass in severe heart failure on maximum cardiac support and still intubated.

Fluoroscopy via C-arm.

2) Inserted in the Cath lab, not intubated.

\-These are the chest pain patients who arrived by ambulance for a STEMI for a PTCA and need left ventricular support.

\-Not necessarily intubated, but already on cardiac drips.

\-The Cath lab setting is ideal for its fluoroscopy and very experienced interventional cardiologist.

\-**Note:** Most Cath labs do not always have an anesthesia machine.

**Simplified synopsis of procedure**

_Requires minimal to no anesthesia as it is not a painful procedure._

The Impella can be inserted percutaneously via the femoral or axilla after a local injection.

A fluoroscopy device is required for guidance.

**Anesthesia management depends on:**

Patient’s present condition

Urgency of the procedure

Surgeon's preference

Location

**Anesthesia:**

\- General anesthesia

\- Local anesthesia

\- Monitored anesthesia care (MAC)

\- Regional anesthesia-rare

\- These patients are in some form of heart failure and will already be on continuous infusions for cardiac support.

\- If intubated, the patient will be on some form of continuous sedation.

\- Connect the patient to the anesthesia machine and maintain ventilatory support and sedation.

\- Titrate cardiac drips as needed.

\- Inhalation agents and further sedation should NOT be required.

\- Carefully transport the patient back to the ICU connected to the Impella Controller.

**Insertion:**

\- The doctor numbs the access area (usually the femoral artery).

\- The doctor obtains access to the femoral artery and inserts a 5–8 Fr introducer over a guidewire to pre-dilate the vessel.

\- The 5–8 Fr introducer is removed over the guidewire.

\- A 12 Fr dilator is inserted.

\- Heparin, bivalirudin, or argatroban is administered to acquire an ACT > 250 seconds.

\- A guidewire is threaded (advanced) into the apex of the left ventricle.

\- The Impella is threaded over the guidewire into the LV for proper placement.

\- The placement guidewire is removed.

\- The placement is confirmed with fluoroscopy, and an aortic waveform is displayed on the Automated Impella Controller.

\- The device is turned on for left ventricular support.

\- Transfer the patient to ICU.
