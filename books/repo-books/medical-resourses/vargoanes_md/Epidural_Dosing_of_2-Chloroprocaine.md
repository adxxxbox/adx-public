### Epidural Dosing of 2-Chloroprocaine (Nesacaine)

_(rarely used in OB, except perhaps for urgent C-section)_  
  
10 ml of 2% 2-Chloroprocaine provides effective analgesia for 40 minutes.  
2% 2-Chloroprocaine is useful for analgesia (when muscle relaxation not needed)  
3% 2-Chloroprocaine is useful for analgesia and muscle relaxation  
  
Is used in labor, is limited due to its short duration.  
Sometimes it can be used for the extension of epidural labor analgesia for instrumental vaginal delivery or emergency C-section.  
  
**More Notes  
**2-chloroprocaine is an ester local anesthetic  
It was initially associated with adhesive arachnoiditis after inadvertent subarachnoid administration. This was attributed to the presence of bisulfate preservative. By 1996, 2-Chloroprocaine was preservative- and bisulfate-free. Since then, there have been no more reports of neurotoxicity.  
  
2-chloroprocaine may adversely affect the efficacy of the prior epidural administration of bupivacaine and opioids, especially morphine; the mechanism of this is unknown.
