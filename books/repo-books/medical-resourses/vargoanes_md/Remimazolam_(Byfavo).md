### Remimazolam (Byfavo)

**Generic name:** Remimazolam  
**Brand name:** Byfavo  
**Chemical formula:** C21H19BrN4O2  
  
Remimazolam is a benzodiazepine similar to midazolam but shorter-acting.  
It also has less influence on hemodynamics than propofol.  
**Midazolam vs Remimazolam:  
Onset:** Both similar**Duration:** Remimazolam has a shorter duration of action.  
**Advantage:** Can be used for induction and maintenance of sedation during short (< 30 minute) procedures.  
**Remimazolam** was developed as an ultra–short-acting agent for procedural sedation and general anesthesia induction and maintenance.  
**Indications:** Induction and maintenance of sedation and procedures lasting 30 minutes or less.  
To date, the clinical use of remimazolam has been confined to a few volunteer studies and a limited number of clinical investigations.  
  
**Possible clinical uses for anesthesia:**Single-dose for premedication  
Bolus followed by supplemental doses for procedural sedation.  
IV anesthetic along with an opioid (as part of total intravenous anesthesia)  
Intensive care unit (ICU) sedation  
  
**Mechanism of action:** Like other benzodiazepines, it potentiates the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on GABA(A) receptors.

|  |   |
| --- | --- |
| Induction of Procedural Sedation | 5 mg IV over 1 minute  
  
**For ASA III and IV patients**  
2.5 to 5 mg IV over 1 minute based on patient's condition |
| Maintenance of Procedural Sedation  
(titrate to effect after initial dose) | 2.5 mg IV over 15 seconds  
Allow 2 minutes between doses  
  
**For ASA III and IV patients:**  
1.25 to 2.5 mg over 14 seconds  
Allow 2 minutes between doses |
| For use in general anesthesia | An initial dose of 6 or 12 mg/kg/hour for induction,  
followed by 1 mg/kg/hour (2 mg/kg/hour of maximal  
infusion rate) for maintenance. |

  
**For use in general anesthesia:**  
An initial dose of 6 or 12 mg/kg/hour for induction, followed by 1 mg/kg/hour (2 mg/kg/hour of maximal infusion rate) for maintenance. _(Journal of Anesthesia 2020;34:962)_  
  
**Documented cocktail for TAVR:  
Induction:** Remifentanil 0.3 mcg/kg/minute and 2 mg/kg/hour until loss of consciousness for approximately 1 minute.  
The trachea was intubated with the aid of rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg).  
Anesthesia was maintained with 1.1–1.2 mg/kg/hour of remimazolam and 0.1 mcg/kg/min of remifentanil. _(JA Clinical Reports Article number: 38; 2022)_  
  
**Infusion mixture:**  
It should be prepared as a 1 mg/mL solution (50 mg remimazolam per 50 mL normal saline), and the manufacturer recommends using a syringe pump for administration.  
  
**Pediatric dosing:**  
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.  
  
**Compatible with the following fluids:  
**0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection  
Lactated Ringer’s  
5% Dextrose Injection,  
20% Dextrose Injection  
5% Dextrose  
0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection  
  
**Single-patient-use vial:**  
Each glass vial contains 20 mg remimazolam white to off-white lyophilized powder, equivalent to 27.2 mg remimazolam besylate.  
The vial also contains 82 mg dextran 40 and 55 mg lactose monohydrate as bulking agents/stabilizers.  
  
**Possible adverse reactions:**  
Hypoxia  
Bradycardia  
Hypotension  
Involuntary movements  
Cough  
Hiccup  
Sneezing  
Transient apnea  
  
Adverse effects can be treated with flumazenil to reverse the effects of remimazolam (antidote).  
  
**Contraindications:  
**Hypersensitivity to remimazolam  
Hypersensitivity dextran 40 and lactose monohydrate  
  
**Opioid Analgesics and Other Sedative-Hypnotics:**  
The sedative effect of intravenous BYFAVO can be accentuated by concomitantly administered CNS depressant medications, including opioid analgesics, other benzodiazepines and propofol.  
  
**Metabolism of **remimazolam:  
****Just like remifentanil, remimazolam is rapidly metabolized by ester hydrolysis.  
Hydrolyzed via hepatic carboxylesterase-1 (CES1) yields the inactive CNS7054 metabolite.  
CNS7054 then undergoes glucuronidation and hydroxylation prior to elimination.  
**Note:** Midazolam is metabolized by hepatic and small intestine cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4).  
The metabolite of remimazolam is inactive.  
Midazolam metabolite is active, which may prolong the sedation time.  
  
**Pharmacokinetics:  
Peak sedation post IV administration:** 3 to 3.5 minutes (similar to midazolam)  
**Protein binding:** \> 91% protein-bound in plasma, primarily to serum albumin  
**Volume of distribution:** 0.76 - 0.98 L/kg  
**IV Distribution half-life:** 0.5 - 2 minutes  
**IV terminal elimination half-life:** 37 - 53 minutes  
**Hepatic impairment:** Half-life is increased.  
  
**Route of elimination:  
Unchanged in urine:** Less than 1%  
**Excreted in the urine:** 50-60% as the metabolite CNS7054  
After twenty-four hours, > 80% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine as the metabolite.  
Half-life is increased in patients with hepatic impairment, necessitating careful dose titration in this population.  
  
**Benzodiazepine antidote flumazenil (Romazicon):  
**0.2 mg flumazenil is recommended as an initial dose; it should be slowly injected over a 15-second period to avoid possible adverse events (hypertension, tachycardia, and anxiety).  
If the desired level of consciousness is not achieved after 60 seconds of the initial dose, the second dose of 0.2 mg can be injected and repeated at 60-second intervals up to a maximum of four additional times and a maximum total dose of 1 mg.  
Subsequently, the dosage should be administered according to the patient's response.  
No more than 1 mg should be administered at any one time, and no more than 3 mg should be injected during any one hour.  
  
**In summary, remimazolam has the following advantages:  
**High clearance  
Small volumes of distribution  
Short half-lives  
Fast onset and recovery of sedation  
Less hemodynamics than propofol.
