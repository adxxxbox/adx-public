### Mastectomy

There are many different kinds of mastectomies- (see “Types of Mastectomies”) for the surgeon to perform. Today, most mastectomies are BILATERAL despite only having cancer to one breast. This is for reconstructive purposes.

**The biggest question: Is there an Axillary Node involved?**  
If the answer is NO, the IV and BP cuff can go on either arm.  
If the answer is YES, no IV or BP cuff should be placed on the affected arm.

**  
Anesthetic**: General with ETT or LMA  
LMAs are now becoming more popular. However, we traditionally almost always intubate.  
**Remember:** If the Axillary Node is involved, don’t relax the patient. The surgeon wants to see the muscles twitch so he/she knows to stay away from the nerves close to the nodes.  
**Position:** Supine with arms out.  
**BP Cuff:** On the opposite arm of Axillary node involvement. It’s OK to place the BP cuff on one of the legs.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable. In the opposite arm of the involved Axillary node. It’s OK to place an IV in the foot if the bilateral axillary nodes were previously removed.  
**Duration:** 1-2.5 hours  
**EBL:** < 100mLs  
**Antibiotics:** Ancef, if not contraindicated. 1 gm for <80kg; 2 gms for >80 kgs.

**Note**: If it is not going to be a long case, there is no reason an LMA cannot be utilized, unless there is a contraindication.
