### Blood Pressure Decrease During Transport and Transfer to Bed

Ensure sufficient slack on r lines, especially the central line and arterial line.  
  
Connect the patient to the portable monitor. Zero the arterial line.  
  
Sometime blood pressure decreases after sliding the patient onto the bed. Have volume and phenylephrine available.  
  
Do not transfer the patient until stable.  
  
Continue with mechanical ventilation until the adequacy of manual ventilation is ensured, including sufficient supplemental oxygen supply for the transfer.  
  
Bring monitoring equipment (e.g. cardiac output thermodilution solution) to the post-op area.  
  
Consider bringing vasoactive medications, suitably diluted and including a syringe of volume adequate to flush this medication into the circulation if it is needed.
