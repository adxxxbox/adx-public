Venous Air Embolism    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Venous Air Embolism (VAE)

_The incidence of air embolism in the sitting position has been described in up to 45% of the cases. Most are minor, asymptomatic and may just mimic cardiac disease._**Possible Symptoms:**  
↓ ETC02 and Hypotension together is very suggestive.  
↓ SaO2 (may be delayed)  
Tachypnea  
Tachyarrhythmias (sometimes bradycardia)  
↑ Right Ventricular Strain  
EKG: Possible ST-T changes (depression) and/or low sensitivity  
Peaking of P waves in earlier stages  
Rales and wheezing  
Hemoptysis  
Pulmonary Edema

**Possible Symptoms - Awake Surgical Procedure**  
Coughing episode  
↓ ETC02  
↓ SaO2 (may be delayed)  
Chest pain  
Nausea  
Acute Dyspnea  
Mental status change  
Focal neurologic deficits

**Possible Symptoms-Post op**  
Neurological impairment ranging from focal neurological lesions to coma

Cardiovascular:  
Acute right heart failure  
Pulmonary hypertension  
Myocardial ischemia and associated pulmonary edema

Cardiovascular collapse

Coagulopathy and reduced platelet count have also been reported following a VAE.

**Treatment**  
Call for anesthesia help and a code cart stat  
↑ Oxygen to 100%  
Turn Off Nitrous Oxide

Inform the surgeon: He/she should flood/pack the surgical field (fill the wound with irrigation).  
If there a central line, attempt to aspirate air  
Jugular compression-now controversial  
Request for Durant Maneuver (not always possible)  
**Durant Maneuver:** Left lateral position and Trendelenburg (so that the air bubbles move toward the right atrium)

The head of the patient (or suspected port of air entry) should be repositioned at the level or below the right atrium.

Inform the surgeon: He/she will Flood/pack the surgical field (fill the wound with irrigation).  
Search for the point of air entry

**Vasopressors to Consider**  
Ephedrine 10-20mg IV as needed  
Dobutamine 5mcg/kg/min IV, ↑ 5mcg/kg/min as needed Q 10 minutes

**Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) or Precordial Doppler can confirm diagnosis**

**TEE**  
TEE is most sensitive and allows for the diagnosis of small air volumes in the heart between 0.01 and 0.19 mL/kg.  
It can also detect paradoxical arterial embolization that may result in cerebral ischemia.

**Precordial Doppler**  

Positive Murmur: Mill wheel. The greater the air entrainment, a more ominous “mill wheel” murmur develops, signaling cardiovascular decompensation.

The precordial Doppler is the **most sensitive of the noninvasive monitors**, capable of detecting as little as **0.25 ml of air (0.05 ml/kg).**

**ETCO2**  
The ETCO2 should be closely watched during a high risk case. A decrease of just 2 mmHg ETCO2 can be a possible indicator of VAE. The “low” ETCO2 alarm should be narrowly set as possible.

**Precordial Doppler placement**:  
Right or left side of sternum 2nd to 4th intercostal space or between the right scapula and to spine.

**Risk Factors of VAE  
**_The incidence of air embolism in the sitting position has been described in up to 45% of the cases. Most are minor and asymptomatic._**  
  
Always be alert with:**

Craniotomy in the sitting position  
Surgery of the posterior fossa  
Craniosynostosis repair  
  
**High Risk:

Central venous access–placement/removal  
Craniosynostosis repair  
  
**Medium Risk  
**Spinal fusion  
Cervical laminectomy  
Prostatectomy  
Gastrointestinal endoscopy  
Contrast radiography  
Blood cell infusion  
Coronary surgery  
Penetrating and blunt chest trauma  
Aggressive positive pressure ventilation  
Thoracocentesis  
Hemodialysis and several other invasive vascular procedures

**Low Risk  
**Peripheral nerve procedures  
Anterior neck surgery  
Burr hole neurosurgery  
Vaginal procedures  
Hepatic surgery

More Notes:  

**Review - Pathophysiology  
**When a venous sinus (usually cranial) is located above the right atrium (sitting or high fowlers position), negative pressure or sub-atmospheric gradient between the two will develop.

When a venous system is opened and exposed to environmental pressure and there is a difference of at least 5 cm of H2O between the two sites, there will be air inflow.

In humans, the lethal dose of air embolism is 3 - 4 mL/kg  
around 100 mL for the adult will trigger clinical manifestations.

Once the air gets into the circulation it lodges inside the superior vena Some of that air volume may pass through the tricuspid valve and reach the pulmonary artery.

When the amount of air is small the pulmonary capillaries have the ability to filtrate it, but when the air volume is larger, the air passes into the pulmonary capillaries causing vasoconstriction and impairment of the ventilation and pulmonary perfusion ratio cava and the right atrium.

This air may obstruct the pulmonary artery flow resulting in a drop in cardiac output, either due to acute right heart failure (obstruction of the right ventricle outflow tract) or due to a reduced left ventricular filling (decreased pulmonary veins flood flow.

**Management Goals When VAE is Strongly Suspected:**  
Prevention of further air entry  
Reduce the volume of air entrained  
Hemodynamic support

**Key factors determining the degree of morbidity and mortality:**  
Volume of gas entrainment  
Rate of accumulation  
Patient’s position at the time of the event

VAE is usually iatrogenic  
Mostly neurosurgical procedures in the sitting position

As little as 20 mL of entrained air can be fatal

200 and 300 mLs or 3-5mL/kg is usually lethal  
5mL/kg of entrained air is critical  
2 or 3 mL of air into the cerebral circulation can be fatal

**PEEP to help Prevent VAE**

Some of our literature states that adding 5cmH20 may help prevent VAE.

This is now controversial; there is no evidence of improving the VAE in neurosurgery and it may further deteriorate the patient's cardiovascular condition.

**Pathophysiology - Tissue Changes with VAE**

Right ventricular strain increases PA pressures and then decreases pulmonary venous return and CO.  
This may cause a circulatory collapse and tachyarrhythmia (sometimes bradycardia) leading to a cardiac arrest.

Also, there is an inflammatory change in pulmonary vessels resulting in direct endothelial damage. The accumulation of platelets, fibrin, activation of the complimentary system and the release of free radicals contribute to pulmonary capillary damage and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.

**Other Surgical Procedures Associated with VAE**  
Radical neck dissection  
Thyroidectomy  
Eye surgery  
Cardiac surgery - Coronary air embolism  
Total hip arthroplasty  
Arthroscopy  
Thoracocentesis  
Blast injuries, excessive positive pressure, open chest wounds  
Cesarean delivery  
Laparoscopic procedures  
Rubin insufflation procedures  
Vacuum abortions  
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy  
GI endoscopy  
Liver transplantation

**Hyperbaric Chamber and VAE**  
The use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for the treatment of VAE has increased recently. Hyperbaric oxygen reduces the size of the bubbles by promoting nitrogen reabsorption and the passage of dissolved oxygen into the blood. It has been more common for arterial air embolisms in the brain.

**PEEP to help Prevent VAE**

Some of our literature states that adding 5cmH20 may help prevent VAE.

This is now controversial; there is no evidence of improving the VAE in neurosurgery and it may further deteriorate the patient's cardiovascular condition.
