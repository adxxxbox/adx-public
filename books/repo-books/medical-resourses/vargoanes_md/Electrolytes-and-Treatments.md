### Electrolytes and Treatments during CABG

**Serum potassium  
3.5 - 5.0** mEq/l.  
Many practices tend to allow serum potassium in the high end of normal.  
  
**Hyperkalemia possible causes:**  
Cardioplegia  
Metabolic acidosis/hypoventilation  
PRBC administration  
  
**Hypokalemia Possible Causes:**  
Furosemide (Lasix).  
Beta-adrenergic stimulation enhances potassium entry into cells.  
Alkalosis/hyperventilation.  
The serum potassium level is difficult to replenish if the serum magnesium level is also low. It may be necessary to replace both.  
  
**Hypokalemia treatment**  
Infuse 10-20 mEq of Kcl slowly through the central live (do not bolus).  
  
**Hyperkalemia treatment**  
Treat if serum K > 6 or in the presence of EKG changes.  
1 gram CaCl.  
  
Or  
  
Furosemide (Lasix) 10-20 mg.  
  
Or  
  
10 units Humulin R insulin with 1 ampule of D50W.  
One study showed that a glucose-potassium insulin infusion may improve cardiac function both for diabetic and non-diabetic patients by providing an energy substrate.  
  
The perfusionist can draw excess K from the hemoconcentrator.  
  
**Normal ionized calcium level (levels are measured in 2 different units)**  
1.1-1.4 mmol/L (most common).  
  
Or  
  
4.5-5.6 mg/dl.  
  
If ionized Ca >1mmol/L NO replacement.  
If ionized Ca <1mmol/L 1 gram CaCl2.  
  
Use caution when administering a bolus of CaCl2. In rare instances, it can cause a temporary hypertensive crisis.  
  
Calcium and HCO3 are not compatible IV admixtures.  
  
In patients taking digoxin, the ECG should be monitored as hypocalcemia potentiates digitalis toxicity.  
  
For each 5 units of packed RBCs transfused, administer 1-2 grams (1-2 amps) of calcium gluconate or 1 gram of CaCl2.  
  
**Serum Magnesium**  
1.8-2.5 mg/dl  
Hypomagnesemia, if present, must be treated to correct.  
Hypocalcemia Note: Not clear why this appears in this section concerning hypomagnesemia.  
Bolus 1-2 grams of magnesium.
