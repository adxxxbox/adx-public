### Myocardial O2 Consumption/Protection - MV02

**Myocardial 02 Consumption**  
At 37C consumption is 8-10 ml/100g/min.  
At 22C reduced to 0.3ml/100g/min.  
  
**Myocardial Protection:**  
Myocardial protection must be adequate. This requires the balance between the myocardial oxygen supply and demand, especially during cardioplegic arrest or hypothermic fibrillation.  
  
Normal myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) is around 8-10ml/100g/minute.  
When the bypass machine unloads the ventricles, MVO2 drops 20%.  
When heart temperature drops from 37C to 22C, MVO2 drops another 50% (70% total).  
  
However, cardioplegic arrest drops the MVO2 by 80%. MVO2 is lower at an arrested normothermic heart at 37C than a hypothermic heart (22C).
