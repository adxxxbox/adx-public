### Ascending Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm Repair

**For a Type A and Type I and II Aneurysm**  
**(**Review “Thoracic Aneurysms Simplified” and “Aneurysm Room Set Up”)

Ascending aneurysms may cause aortic insufficiency and also require an AVR.  
The coronary arteries could also be affected with a dissection and require bypass or reimplantation.  
Median Sternotomy  
Single lumen ETT, does NOT require one lung ventilation.  
Cardio Pulmonary Bypass (CPB)  
Deep Hypothermic Cardiac Arrest (DHCA) for cerebral protection.  
When that area of aorta is clamped for repair, the blood flow to the brain is interrupted. DHCA is the cerebral protection method that we use.  
Standard anesthetic principals for Cardiac Surgery.  
Usual monitors for cardiac surgery.  
  
**A-line debate:** Verify with the surgeon concerning aortic clamp location. The innominate artery (that leads to the right subclavian) or the left subclavian may be involved. You will usually have a femoral line as a back up.

If or when the innominate artery is clamped or interrupted, the right radial waveform will dampen or go flat as your indicator. A femoral A-line is sometimes inserted if there isn’t already one in.

Some literature states to place a left A-line for the opposite reason above. However, I have also seen a right or left A-line with no femoral line.  
Sometimes the patient’s arms get so cold during a circulatory arrest that we have to use an ear clip pulse ox sensor.

**If the patient is stable:**  
Keep the patient warm  
Keep HR slow (avoid tachycardia)  
Avoid anemia (keep HCT >25-30)  
Prevent HTN (avoid challenging the aneurysm)

**Pre-op**  
Cardiac workup. If the patient does not have one, treat them like a CAD patient. Many of these patients have CAD.

Check CXR or CT results for left mainstem bronchus compression by the aneurysm.

A hoarse voice may indicative of aneurysm induced recurrent laryngeal nerve dysfunction

**Type and Crossed:** Yes

**Blood Products**  
Around 10 units PRBC’s available, maintain an HCT > 25-30  
Around 10 units of FFP  
Cryoprecipitate  
2-4 Platelets (5 packs)  
Remember, PRBC’s do not have clotting factors so you need to also give FFP and Platelets.  
0 negative Blood if its emergency.

**Cell Saver:** Yes  
DDAVP: sometimes-and the dose is 0.3mcg/kg.  
  
**If stable:** Sedate and avoid hypertension.  
Largest bore peripheral IVs as possible (16 or 14G if possible).

One or more introducers, Left or Right IJ, or femoral access.

Some institutions use a TEE instead of a swan. You can use one more introducer without a swan.  
CCO SVO2

A TEE provides information on volume status, cardiac and aortic valve function. Sometimes an AVR requirement is not determined until the TEE is done.

**A-line:** Usually right radial A-line and pulse ox on the left. Check with the surgeon. The innominate or left subclavian arteries can be involved affecting both sides. A femoral A-line can be inserted.   
Connect fluids up to the warmer ASAP 

Keep patient as covered as possible.  
Bair Hugger after central line in.  
**BISS Monitor:** Yes, to monitor cerebral electrical silence during DHCA.

**Induction:  
If Stable (Avoid Hypertension)**  
**Methods to avoid hypertension with direct laryngoscopy:**

Consider administering Esmolol with induction.    
Consider Remifentanil, start at 0.5-1mcg/kg/min 8 minutes prior to intubating.  
Consider high narcotic induction dose-like a heart.  
Consider using a Glide Scope. It is less stimulating.

**If Unstable:** RSI, ketamine, scopolamine-5-10mcg/kg instead of versed.  
**LTA Kit:** Yes, if stable  
**Inhalation Agent:** Isoflurane, and turn it up high for DHCA.  
**ETT:** Single lumen  
**NG Tube:** Yes, after TEE  
**Duration:** 3-5 hours  
**Position:** Supine, arms tucked  
**EBL:** 500-1,000mLs  
**Have your conventional heart case meds**  
Heparin, Amicar Protamine etc.  
**Intra-op labs:** ABGs, BMP, CBC, Coags

**CPB Cannulation Sites**  
If the aneurysm ends in the proximal or midportion of the ascending aorta, the arterial cannula can be placed in the upper ascending aorta or arch.

The usual site of cannulation is the femoral artery if the entire ascending aorta is involved. The aortic cannula cannot be placed distal to the pathology without jeopardizing perfusion to the great vessels.

**EEG Burst Suppression:** Rare, we usually don’t give Propofol or Thiopental. Just turn up your Isoflurane.  
**EEG:** Some books say yes, but we rarely use one.  
**Brain Protection**: Yes, pack the head with bags of ice.

**Nasal Pharyngeal Temp Probe**: Books say yes for DHCA and brain protection. However, most places just use a bladder and core temp.

**Brain Protection and DHCA**  
Cover the BIS monitor so the ice bags don’t get it wet.  
**Note:** Some places prefer to use cerebral oximetry instead of the BISS. With **cerebral oximetry,** you can see if one side of the brain drops decreases perfusion. The BISS only alerts us of possible awareness.  
Pack head with bags of Ice  
Core temperature will decrease down to 15-20C  
Isoflurane 1.5 – 2 MAC –increase it  (>0.5 MAC vasodilates the brain).  
  
**EEG Burst Suppression**  
We usually do not use Burst Suppression, but the doses are below:  
**Thiopental** 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg/min.    
**Propofol:** 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg/min   
**Isoflurane:** 1.5-2 MAC  per perfusionist.

**Anterograde and retrograde perfusion:** Yes  
Brachiocephalic or carotid cannulation has been used successfully for intermittent perfusion.  
Retrograde cerebral perfusion through the SVC cannula can also be used.

**Deep Hypothermic Cardiac Arrest (DHCA)**  
Many times these aneurysms extend to the origin of the innominate artery; a brief period of circulatory arrest to resect the aneurysm and perform a distal anastomosis is needed.  
This means the surgeon needs to temporarily cut the flow of blood to the brain to repair the aneurysm. In the mean time, we apply techniques to protect the brain from cerebral ischemia.

**Unclamping and Rewarming**  
The rewarming may be prolonged

**Extubation in the OR:** NO

**More Notes**  
The ascending aorta is the segment between the sinotubular junction of the aortic root and the innominate artery.  
Ascending aortic aneurysms tend to increase in size and eventually rupture or cause an aortic dissection.  
Aneurysm <5cm is low risk.  
Average size during a rupture or dissection was 5.9cm.  
Most are asymptomatic and found with a CXR.  
Ascending aneurysms may cause aortic insufficiency and also require an AVR.  
Coronary arteries could also be affected with a dissection.

If the aortic valve and annulus both are normal, the diseased section of aorta is replaced with graft material.

If the annulus is normal and the valve is incompetent, the valve may be repaired or replaced.  
  
If both valve incompetence and annular dilation are present, either a composite graft (i.e., a tube graft with an integral artificial valve) or an aortic valve replacement with a graft sewn to the native annulus can be used.

The coronary arteries must be reimplanted into the wall of the composite graft.

Sometimes the coronary arteries and may not require reimplantation when a separate aortic valve replacement and grafts are used, depending on whether enough of the native sinus of Valsalva remains.

The posterior wall of the old aneurysm can be wrapped around the graft material and sewn in place to maximize hemostasis.

**Complications** **if CPB and an open ventricle is utilized:**  
Air emboli  
Atheromatous or clot emboli  
LV dysfunction secondary to ischemia  
Myocardial infarction or myocardial ischemia secondary to technical problems with reimplantation of the coronaries  
Renal or respiratory failure  
Clotting abnormalities-from induced hypothermia.  
Surgical hemostasis; bleeding from suture lines can be especially difficult to control.
