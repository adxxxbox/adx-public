## Double Lumen Tube - Determining Tube Size

**Robert-Shaw DLT**  
Most commonly used DLT  
Available in sizes 35, 37, 39, and 41F.

**Choose the largest DLT that will fit**  
Some studies recommend choosing the largest tube that will fit in order to decrease the chance of migration and obstruction, which can result in hypoxemia, lung isolation failure, increased airway resistance, difficulty passing a fiberoptic scope, or tracheal obstruction.  
  
However, others propose inserting a smaller than conventional size to decrease trauma with insertion.

**Common DLT Sizes per Gender**  
Most male adults take a size 37F or 39F  
Most female adults take a size 35F or 37F

**Patient Height**                                **Tube Size**       **Depth of Insertion**

53.5-64.5 inches (4’5” – 5’4” ft)             37F                    27 cm  
64.5-70.5 inches (5’4” – 5’9” ft)             39F                    29 cm  
70.5-76.4 inches (5’9” – 6’4” ft)             41F                    31 cm

  
**Left DLT vs Right:**  
When retrieving a DLT for your procedure, always choose a left DLT unless contraindicated.  
Left-sided DLTs are used more frequently as they are significantly easier to place without obstructing the upper lobe bronchus.  
A right DLT includes an orifice along the bronchial tube to align with and ventilate the RUL.
