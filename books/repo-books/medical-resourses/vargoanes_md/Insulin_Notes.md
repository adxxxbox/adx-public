### Standard Insulin Protocol for CABG

Insulin protocol: check level pre-op and Q1 hour during surgery. The goal of management is to maintain blood glucose below 150 mg/dl.

| Blood glucose, mg/dl | Action |
| --- | --- |
| < 110 | None |
| 110-150 | 3 units per hour, no bolus |
| 150-200 | 6 units per hour, 5-unit bolus |
| 200-250 | 10 units per hour, 10-unit bolus |
| \> 250 | 15 units per hour, 20-unit bolus |

To decrease the incidence of adverse events, including deep sternal wound infection, after CABG, the blood glucose concentration should be monitored and adjusted. Use of continuous insulin, avoiding hypoglycemia, is indicated.  
  
Studies show that maintaining blood glucose level <140mg/dl has uncertain effectiveness.  
  
Measuring preoperative hemoglobin A1c concentrations may be helpful in assessing the adequacy of preoperative glycemic control and identifying patients at risk for postoperative hyperglycemia.
