Pacemaker and AICDs and Pre-op     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Pacemaker and AICDs and Pre-op

There was a study done at a large Midwestern hospital. There was a 3% operative mortality rate associated with pacemaker function.  
Then they started interrogating all pacemakers prior to surgery and found that 10% were not functioning properly. Interrogating all the pacemakers prior to surgery completely eliminated perioperative pacemaker-associated mortality.

This is a liability issue and you could be sued! It only takes about five minutes to find out everything there is to know about your patient’s pacemaker or AICD.  
  
**Identify the device implant and status**  
In advance of the surgical procedure, the patient’s pacemaker/AICD manufacturer’s follow-up clinic and cardiologist group should have been contacted to confirm these:  
 

Patient’s cardiac condition.  
Original indication for device implant.  
Extent of any heart failure.  
Degree of pacemaker dependency.  
Implant complexity (bradycardia support, arrhythmia control,  
cardiac resynchronization therapy).  
If the device is at or approaching replacement phase.  
If the device is subject to a manufacturer or regulatory agency safety advisory notice.  
If the device is part of a clinical investigation where restrictions may apply.

**Patients usually carry a Pacer or AICD card**  
This card should give you details of the device and its manufacturer, model number, serial number, implanting hospital, follow-up hospital, date of/reason for the implant.  
If the patient can’t find the card, you can ask a family member, or get an X-ray of the device and see the make on the circuit board. Moreover, you can see the leads and tell what the device is.  
  
The easiest way to find out what the device is to call Medtronic  @1-800-633-8766. They are open 24/7/365. If you call and identify the patient, they will tell you if the device is a Medtronic device. If there is a question with a pacemaker or defibrillator, they will send a rep.  
**Other Phone Numbers:**  
**Biotronik:** 1-800-547-0394  
**Boston Scientific:** 1-800-CARDIAC  
**Medtronic:** 1-800-633-8766  
**St. Jude:** 1-800-PACEICD  
  
**What you need to know:**  
What is the device?  
What brand and model?  
Who controls or manages it?  
Does your hospital have a programmer for this make and model? What is the magnet mode?  
Why does the patient have a pacemaker? 

This is important because if the patient has it for third degree block, you should treat the device as if the patient’s life depends on the device, because it does.  

What rhythm does the patient have when the pacemaker is shut off?   
If the rhythm is asystole, you might consider placing external pacing pads during surgery if the surgeon is using a bovie electrocautery device.

**The Rep may reprogram the Pacemaker**  
the following changes may be made at the time of the evaluation or on the day of surgery:  
Pacer will likely be turned to DOO or VOO during surgery, if there is no competition from intrinsic or ectopic beats. If pacer is rate-response activated, it will likely be turned off for surgery, particularly with thoracic surgery when chest wall movement occurs - this will prevent inappropriate rapid pacing.

**Reprogramming the pacemaker is probably needed for:**  
A pacer-dependent patient  
Major chest or abdomen case  
Patient who has pacer for obstructive or dilated cardiomyopathy

Most if not all AICDs should be programmed off just before surgery, then back on postoperatively.  

**Special Situations:**  
**Lithotripsy**: keep generator out of shockwave path.  
**ECT**: requires asynchronous (non-sensing) mode.  
**Nerve Stimulator, TENS**: potential problems. We have put in bladder stimulators that required lots of planning between the cardiology group, the surgeon, and Anesthesia. One of our local surgeons is now putting in gastric stimulators for diabetic gastro paresis; his cases require thorough preparation as well.  
**MRI**: Absolute contraindication!
