# Anticholinergic Review

**Anticholinergic Review**  
Atropine and Scopolamine are natural occurring alkaloids of Belladonna plants-tertiary amines-small enough to cross the BBB. Glycopyrrolate (Robinul)- is semisynthetic quaternary ammonium derivative, too large to cross the BBB. (lacks CNS effects)  
Atropine and Scopolamine are esters. They structurally resemble cocaine and Atropine, has weak analgesic effects.  
**MOA**  
Anticholinergic drugs competitively antagonize the effects of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptors.  
Muscarinic Receptors  
M1-in CNS and stomach  
M2- lungs and heart  
M3-CNS, airway smooth muscle and glandular tissues  
M4 and M5-principle site for the CNS receptors  
**These Muscarinic receptors in combination effect:**  
CNS  
Stomach-H+ secretion  
Airway smooth muscle-bronchodilation  
Salivary glands-salivation  
Heart-Bradycardia  
When these Muscarinic Receptors are ANTAGONIZED (as with anticholinergics), you will see the opposite effect.  
Ex. Instead of bradycardia, you may see tachycardia.  
Usual doses of anticholinergic drugs have no effect on nicotinic cholinergic receptors. This is a good thing.  
Cardiac Muscarinic 3 receptors densely populate the cardiac conduction tissues- SA and AV node, and Perkenje Fibers. Very little are located in the ventricular myocardium.  
**Sedation** Scopolamine is 100x more potent than atropine in decreasing the reticular activating system (decreasing the cerebral cortex).  
Enhances sedative effects of narcotics and benzos.  
Scopolamine also causes amnesia.  
CNS Side Effects: Restlessness to somnolence.  
Physostigmine is effective in reversing post op restlessness or somnolence.  
Sedation Doses of Scopolamine:  
IM 0.3-0.5mg  
**Treatment for Reflex Bradycardia**  
Atropine 15-70mcg/kg best for increasing HR.  
Scopolamine and Robinul are NOT your first drugs of choice.  
They increase HR by blocking the effects of Ach on the SA Node.  
In young adults, the vagal tone is enhanced and effects of atropine are evident.  
Infants and elderly-not so much.  
**Bronchodilation**  
Due to the antagonism of ACh, the M2 and M3 receptors of the smooth airway muscles are inhibited. This indirectly causes bronchodilation, depending on the preexisting bronchomotor tone.  
Scopolamine decreases airway resistance and increases dead space by 1/3.  
Robinul effects are similar to scopolamine w/o CNS effects.  
Aerosol (breathing) treatments are more efficacious than IV.  
  
Atrovent (Ipratropium) is the main anticholinergic aerosol drug used for bonchodilation. Atrovent is not as potent or quick acting as the Beta 2 agonist Albuterol. But the 2 can be mixed.  
**Combivent**\-is the combination of Albuterol and Atrovent in the inhaler form.  
**Biliary and Ureteral Smooth Muscle**  
Atropine decreases the tone of the smooth muscles of the biliary tract and ureter, however it is not usually strong enough to overcome the opioid induced spasm of the Sphincter of Oddi.  
**Mydriasis and Cycoplegia** Mydriasis = pupil dilation  
Circular muscles of the iris that constrict the pupil are innervated by cholinergic fibers from the 3rd cranial nerve, whereas fibers from the same nerve cause contraction of the ciliary muscles, allowing the lens to become more convex.  
Anti-cholinergic drugs placed topically on the cornea block the action of acetylcholine at both these sites, resulting in mydriasis and cycloplegia. Complete recovery of mydriasis and cycloplegia produced by topical atropine requires 7 to 14 days.  
Patients with glaucoma, relaxation of the ciliary muscles produced by an anti-cholinergic drug, may occlude the angular space, whereas mydriasis obstructs passage of intraocular fluid into the venous circulation, resulting in potentially hazardous increases in intraocular pressure.  
The mydriasis caused by an anticholinergic drug, can be offset by an anticholinesterase drug (topically).  
**GI System** Robinul was originally used to control peptic ulcer disease. However, the high doses required to inhibit hydrogen ion secretion by gastric parietal cells is often related to unacceptable secretory, ocular, and cardiac side effects.  
Remember: the PNS provides the motor innervation to the GI system.  
It takes a large dose of an anticholinergic to alter GI motility (prevent peristalsis) from the increased peristalsis caused from an anticholinesterase drug (neostigmine) with reversal.  
**Bowel Movement with Reversal**\- when there is more of an anticholinesterase drug given compared to the anticholinergic known ratio-increasing peristalsis resulting to a bowel movement on the operating room table. So with reversal, too much Neostigmine vs Robinul can = BM on the OR table.  
**Prevention of Motion Sickness**  
Scopolamine Patch-place behind an ear (postauricular)-protects against motion induced nausea without side effects of sedation, cycloplegia or drying secretion.  
Should be given at least 4 hours before exposed to a noxious stimulus. Less effective if given during nausea.  
Motion sickness is caused by the stimulation of the vestibular apparatus. It's believed that scopolamine blocks the transmission to the vestibular apparatus of the inner ear.  
**(Anisocoria) One Dilated Pupil** -a unilateral dilated pupil can be present when one rubs their eye after applying a scopolamine patch. More than 90% occurs to pupils on the same side as the patch.  
**Central Anticholinergic Syndrome**  
IV Scopolamine, Scopolamine Patch and to a lesser extent Atropine can enter the CNS and produce anticholinergic syndrome.  
**Possible Symptoms:**  
Restlessness  
Hallucinations  
Somnolence  
Unconsciousness  
**Treatment:** Physostigmine (Antilirium)  
(a tertiary amine anticholinesterase)  
Dose: 15-60mcg/kg. Most just give 1-2 mg. This may require redosing Q1-2 hours.  
In short, if your patient wakes up crazy in recovery room and you know your inhalation agent is out of their system, and they had Atropine or Scopolamine, you may consider giving Physostigmine.  
**The required IM doses for Antisialagogue and Ocular effects**  
Atropine 10-20mcg/kg  
Robinul 5-8mcg/kg  
Scopolamine 5mcg/kg  
Robinul is by far the strongest Antisialagogue.  
Scopolamine is a more potent drying agent than atropine by a factor of about 3 times.  
Atropine has a greater anticholinergic effects then Scopolamine on the heart, bronchial smooth muscles and GI tract.  
Metabolic O2 Consumption  
Robinul increases it  
Atropine has no effect  
Scoplolamine decreases it.  
  
**Low dose Anticholinergics can DECREASE HR rather than increase.**  
**Theory of slowing HR:** Results from blockade of the presynaptic inhibitory M1 receptors on the vagus nerve endings, which usually provide negative feedback on Ach release.  
This inhibition results in an increased Ach release, which initially overcomes the M2 receptors over on the heart.  
Atropine has no effect on a denervated transplant heart.  
**Duration**  
Atropine IV, onset 1 minute and duration 30-60 mins.  
Robunul IV, onset 2-3 minutes and duration 30-60 mins.
