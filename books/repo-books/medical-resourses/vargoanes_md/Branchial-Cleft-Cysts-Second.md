Branchial Cleft Cysts or Sinus –Second Type   

## Branchial Cleft Cysts or Sinus –Second Type

(Second Branchial Cleft Cysts or Sinus)

_Anesthesia wise, this is a basic neck procedure with the head positioned for optimal neck exposure: done with General Endotracheal Anesthesia (GETA)._

The Second Branchial Cleft Cyst is the most common type.

**Location:** Second branchial cysts can occur anywhere along the course of the second branchial apparatus, from the pharyngeal wall to the skin, as it passes laterally and inferiorly between the internal and external carotid arteries. The angle of the mandible is a frequent location. They are usually found along the anterior border of the upper third of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) and adjacent to the muscle.

Second arch anomalies may take several forms. There may be only a simple sinus opening that extends up the neck for a variable distance.

**Second branchial cleft anomalies are the most common by far: 90-95%.**  
**Second branchial cleft cyst** (~30%) These may occur independently, or in association with a branchial pouch sinus or fistula.  
**Second branchial cleft fistula** (~ 22%) Here there is a complete connection between the skin and pharynx.  
**Second branchial cleft sinus (blind pouch)** (~ 42%) This type is a blind pouch that is attached to either the skin or pharynx.

**Symptoms:  
**Intermittent or continuous discharge and infection of neck sinus since birth.  
Recurrent attacks of inflammation.  
Neck cellulitis or abscess formation that occur requiring an incision and drainage.

**Indications for Treatment:**  
Infection  
Mass effect (dysphagia, dyspnea, pain)  
Cosmetic

**Surgery for Second Bronchial Cleft Cyst:**  
During surgery, great care is taken not to rupture the cyst. A full cyst wall is easier to identify than a collapsed one. The jugular vein and carotid arteries need to be identified and isolated. The pedicle of a second branchial cyst is usually just posterior to the jugular vein and courses between the carotid artery bifurcation.

**Treatment** - Complete surgical excision.

**Age Range:** Neonate – Adult

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT for a cyst. Use a Nasal or Oral ETT; ask for surgeon preference.  
**Airway:** The neck may be swollen and inflamed from infection, but usually not enough to impede the airway. Always assess.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Check with the surgeon; facial nerve stimulation may be desired.  
**Position:** Supine, with arms to the side. Shoulder roll with donut beneath the cranium so that the neck is extended. Head of bed is raised slightly to decrease venous blood pressure in the head and neck. The chin is turned away from the operative side.  
**Duration:** 1-4 hours.  
**A-line:** Not needed.  
**IV Access:** One good flowing IV that is age appropriate. Large bore not required.  
Use NS or LR and have albumin ready.

**Hydration: 4:2:1** (below is just a common reference)Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg  
  

**Contraindications:**  
Acute infection (treat prior to excision).  
Medical contraindication to elective surgery.

**Possible Complications:**  
Wound infection.  
Cyst recurrence.  
Hemorrhage from Carotid or other vessels.  
Injury to facial, hypoglossal, glossopharyngeal and spinal accessory nerves.  
Injury to internal jugular vein, or hematoma formation.
