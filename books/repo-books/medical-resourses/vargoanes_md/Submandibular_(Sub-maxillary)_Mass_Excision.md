### Submandibular (Sub-maxillary) Mass Excision

The anesthesia management is usually similar to a submandibular gland excision.  
It may vary depending on the location and type of mass.  
  
**Facial nerve monitoring:  
**Ask the surgeon pre-op if they desire facial nerve monitoring.  
For facial nerve monitoring, use minimal muscle relaxation for induction.  
Imaging studies, such as a CT scan or MRI of the neck, will provide information regarding the extent and relationship of the swelling with the structures around it.  
This information is critical in planning surgical excision should it be necessary.  
An incision is created just beneath the lower jaw.  
The mass is dissected away from the surrounding muscles, vessels, and nerves.  
**Anesthesia:** General/ETT, tape the ETT to the opposite surgical side.  
**Duration:** 45- 90 minutes.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.**Position:** Supine; the bed may be rotated 90 degrees (surgeon preference).  
The patient’s head will be rotated laterally with the surgical side up.  
Shoulder roll.  
**Paralysis:** Usually optional. Sometimes, the surgeon may want facial nerve monitoring.  
**EBL:** <50mLs.  
**MAP:** Avoid hypertension to decrease bleeding.  
  
**Possible complications:  
Nerve Damage:** Facial and Lingual nerve.  
  
**Facial Nerve Damage:**  
The facial nerve, which passes under the chin and near the submandibular gland, makes the lower lip move.  
If damaged, it can weaken the lower lip, resulting in a slightly crooked smile. Weakness of the lower lip may occasionally occur, particularly when the gland is badly inflamed. This weakness is usually temporary and can last for 6-12 weeks.  
  
The **marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve** supplies that part of the angle of the mouth.  
Though great precautions are taken to protect this nerve, sometimes trauma to the nerve caused by instrumentation may result in temporary or permanent weakness of the angle of the mouth.  
  
**Lingual Nerve Damage:  
**Numbness of the tongue often occurs when the lingual nerve gets damaged.  
The nerve that gives sensation and taste to one-half of the tongue runs close to the gland's duct.  
Although rarely injured, the tongue may feel numb immediately after the operation if the lingual nerve is damaged during surgery.  
This usually goes away, and permanent numbness of the tongue is rare.

Other possible complications:
