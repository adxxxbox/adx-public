### Eptifibatide (Integrilin) Reversal

_Currently, there is a lack of specific antidotes for the growing number of new (novel) anticoagulants that are slowly replacing warfarin and heparin. For this reason, there is NO universal standard of care for the treatment of the anticoagulated bleeding patient when there is no specific antidote._

**Consult cardiology for ALL patients with coronary stents.**

**Quick Notes  
**4 hours after termination of an eptifibatide infusion, platelet aggregation recovers to approximately 70% of normal with the return of normal hemostasis.Reversible GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor.  
Usually given concomitantly with heparin. Rarely associated with thrombocytopenia.  
**T1/2:** 2.5 hours; prolonged in renal insufficiency.  
May be removed by dialysis.  
  
**Specific antidote:** None.  
  
**Other two** **GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors:**  
Abciximab (Reopro): irreversible.  
Tirofiban (Aggrastat): reversible.**  
  
Initial Treatment: Non-urgent.**  
Discontinue. Has a short half-life. Should be cleared in around 2-4 hours.Wait 2.5- 5 hours for elimination of drug.  
If platelet count < 20,000/µl, consider transfusion of 1 unit of platelets. However, Eptifibatide is rarely associated with thrombocytopenia.  
Recommend hematology and/or cardiology consult.  
  
**Minor bleed**  
Apply mechanical pressure.  
Desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg x 1.  
Tranexamic acid: little evidence.  
  
**Emergent (Bleeding or surgery within 6 hours)**  
Hematology and/or cardiac consult.  
Platelet transfusion (1 unit) if intervention is truly emergent or if bleeding is serious.  
  
**Major bleeding:** platelet transfusions plus infusion of 10 units of cryoprecipitate  
Hemodialysis.  
Tranexamic acid.  
  
**Life-threatening bleed  
**Transfuse more platelets.  
Initiate massive transfusion protocols.  
FEIBA 8 to 25 units/kg or Kcentra can be considered.  
  
**Monitor:** Evaluate platelet function with assays.  
Thrombin receptor activating peptide-based tests (VerifyNow IIb/IIIa test).  
  
**PT/PTT:** no measurable effect when administered alone.
