### Burr Hole for Chronic Subdural Hematoma

**Note:** Acute subdural or epidural hematomas are much worse and are often emergency cases.  
**Subdural**: A venous bleed.  
**Epidural:** An arterial bleed. Keep the patient in full fluid status and maintain a slightly increased BP.  
These patients are usually the elderly who experience a fall and developed a slow bleed.

The CHRONIC subdural hematoma (over 2 weeks old) is located right beneath the dura between the dura and arachnoid mater. It may be drained through a small hole (Burr Hole) in the skull to avoid a large craniotomy flap. 

The surgeon makes a small scalp incision to expose the cranium over the area of the hematoma. Then, a drill is used to make a hole in the skull. Once the burr hole is completed, an additional incision must be made in the dura. The dura is the tough covering over the brain. While it appears to be a thin layer, it is actually quite strong and must be moved aside. The hematoma (blood clot) is now seen, and the surgeon will irrigate and aspirate it out. Sometimes a drain is inserted. The scalp is then closed.

This is one of our easier cranial type cases because the procedure is external to the brain. The patient is usually stable, EBL is minimal, usually don’t require maximum ICP protection and the procedures are not long in duration.

**Anesthetic**: General/ETT  
(However, there is literature and even YouTube videos showing these cases as deep MAC or simple local injections cases).  
Make sure you secure the ETT on the opposite operative side. Some of us tape the ventilator tubing over the patient’s chest to keep it out of the way. I’ve seen some CRNAs use an Oral Rae.

**Nitrous Oxide:** NO: it may accumulate in the residual subdural cavities and can cause a tension pneumocephalus.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Yes.  
**IV Fluids:** LR or NS is OK because they are equiosmolar. Avoid hyperosmolar fluids and dextrose-containing fluids.    
**Position:** Usually supine, depends on the location of hematoma.  Arms to the side but usually not tightly tucked. Some CRNAs will papoose the patient’s limbs with a sheet.  
The bed is usually rotated 90 degrees. Make sure all your tubing and cords are coordinated together with enough slack before the bed is rotated.   
**Head stability:** Either on towels, a cerebellar head rest or Mayfield Head Pins.  
**Mayfield Pins and Propofol:** The application of Mayfield Pins is very stimulating.  Most of us bolus with 50-100mg of Propofol just prior to prevent the BP from skyrocketing. So have some extra Propofol available.  
**A-Line:** Not needed.  
**BP regulation:** Ask the surgeon where he wants the BP.  
**Hyperventilation:** Usually not needed. We usually keep the ETCO2 around 30. It never hurts to ask the surgeon.  
**EBL**: Minimal  
**IV Access:** 20G is really only needed, but we usually insert 2 in case a rare hemorrhage occurs.  
**Foley:** Usually; it is never a bad idea.  
**When procedure is complete:** Protect your ETT when they are peeling off the sterile facial protective coverings. It may be inadvertently attached to the ETT.  
**Emergence:** Make sure the bed is rotated towards you for optimal access to the airway. You still want to avoid an elevated BP with emergence. HOB should be up with emergence.

Consider labetalol 1-3 minutes prior to and/or a deep extubation. Consider a nasal airway since they are less stimulating.  
  
**Possible Complications:**  
Injury to or tearing of the scalp from the pins on the Mayfield clamp.  
Brain insult  
Infection

**More Notes**  
A subdural hematoma develops when the tiny bridging veins that run between the dura and surface of the brain tear and leak blood. This is usually the result of a mild head injury. A collection of blood then forms over the surface of the brain. In a chronic subdural collection, blood leaks from the veins slowly over time.

A subdural hematoma is more common in the elderly because of normal brain shrinkage that occurs with aging. This shrinkage stretches and weakens the bridging veins. These veins are more likely to break in the elderly, even after a minor head injury.
