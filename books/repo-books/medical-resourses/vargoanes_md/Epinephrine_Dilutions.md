**Quick Epinephrine mix:** 1mg vial mixed with 250 ml bag = 4mcg/ml  
1mg vial mixed with 100 ml bag = 10 mcg/ml

Epinephrine is commonly added to local anesthetics for spinals and epidurals in order to:  
**Increase duration of the local anesthetic  
Reduce peak plasma levels by decreasing vascular uptake (reduces risk of toxicity)Improve block reliabilityIntensify analgesia/anesthesiaThe effect of epinephrine mixed with lidocaine is far greater than when mixed with bupivacaine.  
During epidural administration, the concentration of 5mcg/ml (1:200,000) will nearly double the duration of lidocaine action.  
When used in regional anesthesia, epinephrine in doses of 5-20 mcg per ml can generally be used to decrease vascular absorption.  
Does not work equally for all local anesthetics in all spaces.  
**  
Epidural Doses for Epinephrine  
**Common doses of epinephrine for epidural = 5 mcg/ml (1:200,000) with lidocaine.It nearly doubles the duration of epidural lidocaine anesthesia.**  
  
Epinephrine in Test Doses is Already Premixed to Verify Catheter Placement**  
The epinephrine is usually premixed with 1.5% Lidocaine (15mg/mL) in a 5 mL test dose vial as part of the epidural kit.  
Drawing up 3 ml in a syringe gives you 15mcg of epinephrine and 45mg of lidocaine. This simplifies use as no dilution is required.  
**  
Spinal Doses of Epinephrine  
**Commonly accepted practice is to add 0.1-0.2mg of epinephrine to the local anesthetic for spinals.This equates to 0.1-0.2 ml drawn up in a Tb syringe from a 1:1000 epinephrine vial, then added to the syringe with the local anesthetic.  
1:1000 epinephrine =1mg/ml  
Realistically, most anesthesia providers just perform an “epi–wash” for convenience, unless maximum duration is desired. The “epi-wash” yields less than 0.1ml (0.1mg) of epinephrine.**  
  
What is an Epi wash?  
**An Epi-wash (Epinephrine “wash” technique) technique used by many anesthesia providers to prepare local anesthetic/epinephrine mixtures for regional anesthesia.The Epi-wash method is a faster and more convenient way to mix epinephrine and a local anesthetic by just using one syringe.  
Using the syringe and needle to be used for drawing up the local anesthetic, draw up around 0.1mL of 1:1000 Epinephrine.  
Pull the plunger back all the way then expel the epinephrine from the syringe completely.  
There will still be small amount of epinephrine in the dead space of the plunger, hub and needle. Then you use The same syringe and needle are then used to draw up local anesthetic.  
Epi-wash technique has been proven to be less precise than drawing up the epinephrine and measuring it with TB syringe, but still effective.  
Epinephrine mixed with lidocaine or chloroprocaine for use in the epidural space has been shown to decrease systemic absorption by approximately 30%.  
Epinephrine is the most commonly used vasoconstrictor adjunct for local anesthetics.  
Formerly, 0.5-2 mg of phenylephrine was used, but epinephrine was found to be superior.  
**  
Mechanism of Action**  
Epinephrine (and other vasoconstrictors) act as agonists on G-protein coupled receptors located in vascular smooth muscle of blood vessels.  
It stimulates phospholipase C, resulting in calcium influx and vasoconstriction of blood vessels.  
This reduces vascular absorption of a local anesthetic and maintains a higher concentration of that local anesthetic at the area of the nerve roots, thus INCREASING duration of action. The decreased vascular absorption of local anesthetic also means less LOCAL ANESTHETIC TOXICITY.  
**  
Epinephrine has analgesic (antinociceptive) effects  
**Epinephrine has an antinociceptive effect when injected into the subarachnoid space by exerting its analgesic effect through the stimulation of α2 adrenergic receptors.These presynaptic adrenergic receptors are found at the terminals of primary afferent neurons. They can also be found in the spinal cord via substantia gelatinosa within the dorsal horn.**  
  
Efficacy of Neuraxial Epinephrine**  
Reducing vascular absorption of local anesthetics improves the quality of block and prolongs duration of blockade.  
This not only reduces toxicity, it permits a larger dose of local anesthetic when mixed with epinephrine.  
This is why you see MAX doses of local anesthetics for regional anesthesia is written as “with and without epi.”  
**Example:** Max dose of lidocaine is 4.5mg/kg (without epinephrine)  
7 mg/kg with (epinephrine)  
**  
Epinephrine does not work as well with some local anesthetics  
**Local anesthetics that have a high lipid solubility, such as bupivacaine, bind more avidly to tissues and have less systemic absorption compared to less lipid soluble agents. The mixing of epinephrine with bupivacaine is less effective at prolonging the duration of blockade when compared to lidocaine. There is some evidence that epinephrine helps little with prolonging the duration of bupivacaine. However, anesthesia providers still mix it with bupivacaine, especially in spinals.**  
  
Side effects of Neuraxial Epinephrine  
**An increase in plasma levels of epinephrine can be seen after neuraxial administration of local anesthetic solutions containing epinephrine.Epinephrine is an agonist at both alpha and beta adrenoceptors and may cause tachycardia and hypertension in a dose dependent manner.Epinephrine used in neuraxial anesthesia must be preservative-free.Care should be taken in women suffering from pre-eclampsia as systemic absorption of adrenaline may cause further elevations in blood pressure.

More Notes and Facts of Neuraxial Epinephrine  
**Don’t mix Epinephrine with RopivacaineEpinephrine is not added to ropivacaine due to ropivacaine’s inherent vasoconstrictive effects.There is also no change in duration.**  
  
Local anesthetics with greatest duration increases from Epinephrine**  
Lidocaine  
Mepivacaine  
2-chloroprocaine  
**  
Local Anesthetics with LEAST effect from Epinephrine**  
Bupivacaine  
Levobupivacaine  
Etidocaine  
One study showed that adding 3.3 mc/ml of epinephrine with 0.5% bupivacaine had NO effect on maternal venous plasma concentrations in laboring women.  
Evidence regarding mixing epinephrine with bupivacaine is inconclusive.  
**  
Epinephrine with Bupivacaine  
**The addition of epinephrine to bupivacaine for use in the epidural space decreases systemic absorption by around 10-20%, and is less effective at prolonging the duration of blockade when compared to lidocaine.  
**  
Epinephrine is better than Neosynephrine**  
Epinephrine is more effective in reducing peak blood levels of local anesthetics when compared to neosynephrine.  
Norepinephrine and phenylephrine have been used as vasoconstrictors for regional anesthesia but do not exhibit any properties that make them superior to epinephrine.
