Hypospadias   

## Hypospadias

Hypospadias is a birth defect in boys in which the opening of the urethra is not located at the tip of the penis, and is usually located, instead, on the underside of the penis.

In boys with hypospadias, the urethra forms abnormally during weeks 8–14 of gestation. The abnormal opening can form anywhere from just below the end of the penis to the scrotum. There are different degrees of hypospadias; some can be minor and some more severe.

**The type of hypospadias a boy has depends on the location of the opening of the urethra:**  
**Subcoronal** : The opening of the urethra is located somewhere near the head of the penis.  
**Midshaft** : The opening of the urethra is located along the shaft of the penis.  
**Penoscrotal** : The opening of the urethra is located where the penis and scrotum meet.

5 boys out of every 1,000 born in the United States have hypospadias.  
  
Treatment for hypospadias depends on the type of defect.  
Most cases of hypospadias will need surgery to correct the defect.

If surgery is needed, it is usually done when the boy is between the ages of 3–18 months old.

Most of the time, the surgery is done in stages.

No matter what the stage of the surgical procedure, the anesthesia is usually the same.

Ask the surgeon how long the procedure will be. If it is a long procedure, you may want to consider an ETT. Otherwise, an LMA is usually acceptable.

**Pre-op and what to prepare. What you need to find out?  
**Is there cardiac issues or other defects?  
Does the patient already have an IV?  
Any URI or recent cold/cough?

**Anesthetic:** General Anesthesia with caudal is the most popular.

**Airway issues:** LMA vs ETT for GA, dependent upon size of patient.  
LMA not generally used for patients < 7 Kg due to complications with the LMA seating and being unable to generate positive pressure ventilation should the need arise.**Regional: Caudal dose-** 1 ml/kg of 0.25% Bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.

**Spinal:** optional but very rare.

**Induction:** Inhalation**Nitrous:** Optional, not needed after a caudal.

**MAC:** 0.5-0.8 after a caudal

**Muscle Relaxation:** Not required.**Position** : Supine and typically moved towards the foot of the OR table for better surgical positioning.  
**Duration:** 60-120 minutes  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** Urology patients often are difficult to obtain IV access, can access the saphenous vein.

**Hydration: 4:2:1** **(below is just a common reference)**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**A-line:** Not needed**Age Range:** 3 months to 2 years.**Foley Catheter:** Not necessary for this procedure. However, a urethral stent will normally be placed by the surgeon during the procedure.**Emergence:** +/- Ketorolac, if ok with surgeon.  
+/- Fentanyl, can sometimes be used before the caudal/penile block set up.  
LMA can be removed deep.  
**Possible Complications:** As with any young pediatric population, laryngospasm is always a possibility either during induction or emergence and can happen if the patient is too light with LMA in place. Patient can have some bleeding issues which is generally decreased with the use of regional anesthesia (no ketorolac if patient having problems with bleeding).
