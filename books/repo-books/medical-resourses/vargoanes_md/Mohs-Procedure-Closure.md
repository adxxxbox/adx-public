### Mohs Procedure – Closure

Mohs surgery is a precise surgical technique used to treat skin cancer. During Mohs surgery, layers of cancer-containing skin are progressively removed and examined until only cancer-free tissue remains. Mohs surgery is also known as Mohs micrographic surgery. These procedures are sometimes done by eye docs when the cancer is just preciously removed too close to the eye for the original surgeon to close. The patient shows up with a deep looking round hole in their skin and a skin graft is done to cover it.

**Anesthetic**: MAC with a field block.  
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 22G is acceptable. A 500mL NS bag with micro drip tubing is popular.  
**Position**: Supine with arms tucked and the patient remains on the same stretcher. Make sure the ETCO2 NC is looped away from the surgical eye. The stretcher is parked 90-180 degrees away from you (unless you are starting out as a general).
