### Redo Heart Sternotomy

A second or subsequent sternotomy for heart procedures carries with it the risk for catastrophic hemorrhage. Blood must be in the operating room and ready to infuse prior to beginning the procedure.  
  
Adhesions may have developed since the prior procedure; these may place the heart itself in danger. It likely that the sternotomy saw may cut through one of the grafts, usually the LIMA, or through the wall of the right ventricle itself. Thus the risk of catastrophic hemorrhage.  
  
To minimize this risk, a different instrument may be used for “re-do” sternotomy. Instead of the usual pneumatic sternal saw, a safer, more aggressive oscillating saw may be used. Using the oscillating saw, it may not be necessary to deflate the lungs as is the case with conventional sternotomy.  
  
**Risks of second and subsequent procedures:**  
More advanced cardiac pathology.  
Increased operative and postoperative morbidity.  
Increased mortality.  
Longer ICU stay.  
Higher risk of mediastinitis.  
More complications.
