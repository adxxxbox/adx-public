### Hysterectomy - Robotic

**There are two types of robotic hysterectomy procedures:**  
**Simple hysterectomy**: Involving removal of just the uterus and cervix.  
**Radical hysterectomy**: Used as a primary treatment for early-stage cervical cancer in which the parametria (bands of connective tissue in the pelvis), uterosacral ligaments and upper vagina are also removed.  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
**Duration:** 1-4 hours (depends on experience of the surgeon).  
**Position:** Lithotomy, bed all the way down, maximum Trendelenburg with both arms tucked.  
You should closely observe the patient status on the bed when going to maximum Trendelenburg. These patients will move due to gravity. Lower the legs in lithotomy pose before moving the patient into a maximum Trendelenburg.  
**IV Access:** 1-2 20 or 18G. If you just use 1 IV, make sure it runs well as soon as that particular arm is tucked. Correct any IV issues at this time before surgery begins.  
**IV Fluid:** 1-2 liters of crystalloids is common.  
**Neo Drip:** Usually prophylactically in case the patient needs it. Make sure you connect your Neosynephrine tubing before the arms are tucked.    
**OGT:** Consider it, especially if the patient has gastroparesis. I’ve seen bile drip down over the patient’s faces during these cases.  
**Face Protection:** Yes, a foam donut pillow or cradle placed over the face. Some of the robotic equipment is placed on the drapes and ends up very near the patient’s face.  
**Eye protection:** Always use goggles. Eye goggles are standard in most facilities. At our facility, we have adhesive eye protectors that are a fairly flat vinyl clear shield secured with a foam covering. The device looks like the Lone Ranger’s mask. Very good idea.  
There seems to be a higher incidence of cornea abrasions with robotic cases. The theory is that scleral edema irritates the patient’s eyes post-operatively, which leads to rubbing and scratching their cornea. Some facilities leave the goggles on the patient until they are fully awake in the recovery room.  
**Indigo Carmine:** Usually, this drug is administered intravenously at the end of the case to assure the ureters were not damaged. The surgeon verifies with a cystoscopy.  
**Scleral Edema:** Yes, being in steep Trendelenburg for hours can cause this.    
**Ventilation Issues:** Yes, you may need to change to Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV).

Once in steep Trendelenburg, the abdominal contents will drop against the diaphragm, decreasing FRC, compliance and lung volumes. It will immediately become difficult to volume ventilate due to the elevated peak pressures. The clue will be the alarming of your high peak pressure alarms once the patient is in steep Trendelenburg. This is especially exaggerated with patients with large abdomens.   
  
**Possible Complications**  
Bleeding  
Vaginal Cuff dehiscence  
Bladder injuries  
Scleral Edema from steep Trendelenburg.  
Corneal Abrasions may happen post op from the patient rubbing their irritated eyes.  
  
**Protect Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP)**  
MAP-ICP (or CVP) = CPP  
Normal CPP = 70-110mmHg  
In steep Trendelenburg, the CVP or ICP is drastically elevated, so it is obvious here not to permit a low MAP. A low Map will increase the risk of stroke.  
CPP < 50mmHg   = slowing of the EEG.  
CPP 25-40mmHg = flat EEG  
CPP  < 25 mmHg = irreversible brain damage.

**More Notes**  
Robot-assisted surgery is now coming more popular in hysterectomies. It allows for excellent visualization of the blood vessels, ureters and surrounding tissue as well as improved ability to suture the vagina after removal of the uterus and cervix.

**Advantages of Robotic Hysterectomy**  
Less blood loss during surgery.  
Better visualization of the operating site.  It uses a magnified 3-D, high-definition image.  
Less scarring.  
Less post-operative pain  
A faster recovery and shorter hospital stay.  
Fewer post-op complications**.** Compared to open surgery, minimally invasive hysterectomy procedures including robotic hysterectomy are associated with reduced risk of complications, including infection of the incision sites.

Robotic hysterectomies add at least $2,000 to the hospital cost.
