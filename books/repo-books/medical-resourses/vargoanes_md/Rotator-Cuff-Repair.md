Rotator Cuff Repair     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Rotator Cuff Repair

The rotator cuff is a series of FOUR separate muscles in the shoulder joint that form tendons and insert onto the bone. One muscle is in the front of the shoulder as well as two muscles on top and one in the back. It’s really a combination of four separate muscles inside the shoulder joint. It is responsible for lifting the arm overhead and rotating the arm to the side. These muscles and tendons hold the arm in its ‘ball and socket’ joint and help the shoulder to rotate and move.

**The muscles in the rotator cuff include:**   
Teres minor  
Infraspinatus  
Supraspinatus  
Subscapularis

The procedure is either open, arthroscopically or a mini-Open Repair. It may include shaving off any bone spurs that are pinching the shoulder, or repairing torn tendons or muscles in the shoulder. A complete tear may require a larger incision.  
A partial tear may only need a trimming or smoothing procedure called a debridement.   
No matter what method is used, the goal is to attach the tendon back to the bone where it originally tore off. The tendon is attached with sutures. Small rivets called suture anchors are often used to help attach the tendon to the bone. The suture anchors can be made of metal or material that dissolves over time, and do not need to be removed. Sutures are attached to the anchors which tie the tendon back to the bone.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT is combined with a regional Interscalene Block. A supraclavicular block is possible but it sometimes does not cover the proximal upper arm.

The Interscalene Block is almost always done pre-operatively for post op pain management. If the patient can not lift their arm just prior to surgery, you have a pretty good idea you will not need much narcotics during the case. Some surgeons request relaxation.    
**LMA instead of ETT:**  Some anesthesia providers prefer an LMA over the use of ETTs for shoulders. But to warn you, your entire case can be miserable if you acquire ventilation issues once the patient is prepped and draped.  Airway access is very limited when the patient is sitting up with drapes over their head. Most CRNAs still prefer to intubate.    
**Positioning:** Beach-chair or lateral decubitus. Lateral is rare. The Bed is rotated 45-90 degrees. Tape the ETT securely since your access to the airway will soon be limited.  
Keep the MAP within 20 percent of the baseline. Your biggest two concerns for this position are Venous Air Embolism and a CVA. Have your Neosynephrine drip ready when you sit the patient up.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
**Neo Drip:** Yes, you must avoid hypotension. The BP naturally drops when you sit the patient up. The IV and the BP cuff are both on the non-operative arm. Try to avoid the antecubital site for the IV insertion.   
**Duration:** 1.5-3 hours  
**EBL:** 10-50 mLs.  
**BP:** Avoid Hypotension.  
  
**NOTE**: The patient’s BP at their HEAD level could be around 25% below the cuff pressure at the arm level.     
Arterial pressure is reduced 0.77mmHg for every cm gradient above the heart. The vertical distance between the heart and head can be 22-90cm depending on the patient’s height. So there can be a relative difference in perfusion pressure between the brain and level of the heart. The surgeon may request the SBP to be less than 100mmHg if there is bleeding that blurs their arthroscopic view. You still need to keep the MAP within the 20% of the baseline to protect the cerebral perfusion.  
  
**Possible Complications:**  
Infection  
Hypotension and stroke.  
Axillary nerve damage.  
Musculocutaneous nerve damage.  
Brachial Plexus nerve damage which is position dependent.

Axillary nerve damage.  
Musculocutaneous nerve damage.  
 

**More Notes:**

**Rotator Cuff -Mini Open Repair (combined)**  
The mini-open repair uses newer technology and instruments to perform a repair through a small incision. The incision is typically 3 to 5 cm long. This technique uses arthroscopy to assess and treat damage to other structures within the joint. Bone spurs, for example, are often removed arthroscopically. This avoids the need to detach the deltoid muscle.

Once the arthroscopic portion of the procedure is completed, the surgeon repairs the rotator cuff through the mini-open incision. During the tendon repair, the surgeon views the shoulder structures directly, rather than through the video monitor.
