Factor IV    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Factor IV (Calcium: Ionized calcium)

Required for coagulation factors to bind to phospholipids (formally known as factor IV)  
It is both intrinsic and extrinsic (common pathway).  
  
**Source:** Bone, GI tract from food consumption.  
Clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X require calcium ion to work enzymatically.  
Only small amounts of Ca are need for coagulation.  
A calcium deficiency would NOT be expressed as a coagulation dysfunction, except in cases of massive transfusion.
