**SURGERY TO REPAIR OR OPEN THE CHOANA**  
The choanal atresia can be repaired or opened with a surgical procedure. 70 to 90% of choanal atresia involves bone and the soft tissue covering the bone. Only in a small portion of cases is the narrowing composed of only soft tissue and no bone. There are multiple techniques that can be used during surgery, but most often an endoscopic approach is used nasally. With an endoscopic approach there are no incisions on the face or the palate. The procedure is done through the nostrils. The bone and soft tissue that is obstructing the opening is taken down until it is open to the nasopharynx.  
  
An “open” approach can be used in which an incision is made into the palate from the oral cavity to access the narrowing in the nose. After the atresia is opened, the palate is then closed. In either case, endoscopic or open, a temporary stent may or may not be placed to keep the newly created choana open. It is possible that the opening may begin to close, with or without a stent. More than one surgery is often necessary to try to keep the nasal airway open. Mitomycin may be used during surgery to reduce postoperative scarring. However, a suitable airway is attainable in the vast majority of patients.

Once the atresia is repaired and well-healed, patients who required a tracheotomy, can usually have the tracheotomy removed as long as there are no other problems for which the tracheotomy would be necessary. The timing of removal of the tracheotomy will vary by patient.

**Short summary of the surgical procedure** :  
Transnasal endoscopic approach is the procedure of choice for managing choanal atresia. Using a combination of dilators,sinus instruments, ear currettes and drills the posterior nasal airway is opened. A piece of endotracheal tube may be placed as a stent to keep the nares patent until healed.

The transpalatal approach is used in rare circumstances where there is a skull base or craniofacial deformity.  
**This is a general case that usually takes 1-3 hours without much blood loss and muscle relaxation is optional, but recommended.**

**Pre-op:  
**Have difficult airway equipment available incase there is associated anomalies.Is it unilateral or bilateral?  
Make sure you have appropriate size oral airways and McGovern nipple (airway).

**Does the patient have any other anomalies like :**  
CHARGE  
Treacher Collins syndrome  
Tesseir syndrome  
  
**Look for associated airway anomalies:**  
Cleft Lip  
Laryngo-tracheo-bronchomalacia?Reflux

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT**Airway issues:** Yes, leave oral airway in place during induction.

Have smaller ETTs available and depending on other associated anomalies prepare for a difficult airway.**Regional-Caudal:** No

**Induction: IV or mask****Nitrous:** optional**Muscle Relaxation:** Highly recommend as dilators and drills are being used in close proximity to the base of the skull.**Position** : Supine  
**Duration:** 1-3 hours  
**EBL:** minimal**Blood Bolus dose:** 10-20cc/kg if needed.  
**IV Access:** 1 well functioning IV  
**Hydration: 4:2:1** (below is just a common reference)Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**A-line:** No**Age Range:** Bilateral are repaired in the first few weeks of life if no other problems cause a need for delay. Unilateral are usually repaired between age 2-5 years.**Foley Catheter** : Not needed**Hydration:** May be an issue in newborns.**Emergence:** You will most likely have a better airway than you started with as the nasal airway will be patent and have stents in place.

**Post op** : Observation in the PICU or a monitored bed with the focus on airway obstruction.**Possible Complications:  
**Injury to the brain and brainstem during the initial puncture of the atretic plate.  
Children with CHARGE syndrome and mid face abnormalities have a higher incidence of post op respiratory distress after general anesthesia.
