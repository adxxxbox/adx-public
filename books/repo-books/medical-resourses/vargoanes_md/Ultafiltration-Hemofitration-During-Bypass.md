### Ultrafiltration - Hemofitration During CPB Perfusionist’s Job

Cardiopulmonary bypass can negatively affect the lungs, heart and all other organs.  
  
Hemofiltration is a rapid and efficient method for managing fluid overload in patients, especially those with renal failure.  
  
CPB causes an increase pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines that cause a generalized inflammatory and immunologic response. Ultrafiltration eliminates most of these and improves post-op pulmonary, cardiac and neurologic function.  
Ultrafiltration decreases the myocardial inflammatory response and myocardial edema, improving left ventricular compliance.  
  
**Ultrafiltration during CPB**

-   Preserves platelets and coagulation factors.
-   Allows removal of: free water solutes (electrolytes, urea, creatinine, and glucose).
-   Increases HCT by removing excess plasma water.
-   Is efficacious in patients with both abnormal and normal renal function.
-   Improves coagulation function and decrease the inflammatory response after CPB.
-   Has been shown to benefit pulmonary, renal, cardiac, and brain function after CPB.

Can simplify management of volume and electrolytes.
