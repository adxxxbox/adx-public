Tonsillectomy Removal Methods   

### Tonsillectomy - Removal Methods

In current literature, no single technique can be recommended as an ideal method for a tonsillectomy. _New tonsillectomy devices are always being introduced with less trauma and low fire risks, but most ENT surgeons still stick with the bovie for comfort and speed._

_I have questioned ENT docs who prefer electrocautery and they will tell you that patients all hurt after a tonsillectomy despite what method is utilized._

**Hot Methods:  
**Electrocautery is a high fire risk.  
Laser tonsillectomy is a high fire risk.  
Coblation tonsillectomy.  
Radiofrequency.  
**  
Cold Methods:  
**Dissection and snare: this old cold method not used much anymore.  
Guillotine: rarely used anymore.  
Intracapsular tonsillectomy with debridement.  
Harmonic scalpel.  
Plasma-mediated ablation technique-same as coblation.  
Cryosurgical technique.  
  
**For extracapsular techniques:**  
“Cold Methods” tonsillectomy: This method has less post-op pain compared to an electrocautery or “hot” tonsillectomy; however, the electrocautery is faster and with less intraoperative blood loss.  
  
**Electrocautery (bovie)–the most common of all methods.**  
_This is a Hot method and a greater fire hazard than other methods._Electrocautery is commonly used for extracapsular tonsillectomies. An experienced ENT surgeon can use an electrocautery with a fine needle-tip applicator at low power setting to make incisions with less bleeding. With this conservative technique and frequent cold irrigation during surgery, thermal injury and resulting postoperative discomfort is minimized. An additional suturing and sometimes the application of thrombus or packing is used to minimize bleeding. This method also reduces exposed raw tissue areas and is commonly utilized to minimize pain and improve swallowing after surgery.

However, the bovie is still considered a “Hot method” and does create a spark fire hazard. You need to decrease the oxygen to <30% immediately after the airway is secured if the patient can tolerate it. Electrocautery produces temperatures between 400 to 600 degrees Centigrade which both cuts and stops bleeding.  
**Advantages:** Faster, inexpensive and surgeons are comfortable with it.  
**Disadvantage:** More post-op pain, more post-op bleeding and a fire hazard.

**Coblation (** bipolar radiofrequency ablation) 2nd most common:_This is a Hot method and very low fire hazard._

Can be used for intacapsular or extracapsular tonsillectomies, but more recently it has been used for intracapsular tonsillectomies. It provides simultaneous tissue ablation and hemostasis.  
This method involves an electric probe, which has a suction channel and drips out NSS. The electric current excites the molecules in the saline fluid, and then the energy from these excited molecules causes the proteins in the tonsil tissue to break down, like blanching an egg white. This all occurs at 40-50°C, with very little heating effect to the surrounding tissues compared to other traditional electrical techniques: the tissues aren't burned or cauterized at all. Coblation can also be used for enlarged tonsils and chronic or recurrent infections.

**Advantages:** Less painful, faster healing and low fire hazard.  
**Disadvantages:** Tonsils may grow back; more expensive.

**Harmonic Scalpel :**  
_This is a Cold Method and very low fire risk_ .  
It uses a blade that vibrates at 55,000 cycles per second using ultrasound, allowing precise cutting and coagulation.  
The Harmonic scalpel uses ultrasonic technology to cut and coagulate tissues at lower temperatures than those associated with electrocautery and lasers. This technique produces less tissue destruction than the traditional cold knife and cautery technique. Several studies have also reported that patients experience less post-operative pain used for tonsillectomy.  
The major disadvantage is the expense of the equipment and the increased duration of surgery.  
  
**Dissection and Snare method:  
**This method USED to be the most common method to perform tonsillectomy today.  
The tonsil is dissected along with its capsule and lifted out of its bed by use of a forceps and scissors and a tonsillar snare, which is also known as the Eve's snare. Snaring the tonsil has a distinct advantage. Since the tonsil is crushed before it is cut, bleeding is minimized. At this juncture it must also be pointed that blood supply to the tonsil reaches it through its lower pole. The advantage of this method is that the procedure is safe, bleeding is less and the tonsil can be removed without any remnants. It is now being replaced by newer methods.

**Radiofrequency ablation: quite** rare.Monopolar radiofrequency thermal ablation transfers radiofrequency energy to the tonsil tissue through probes inserted in the tonsil. The procedure can be performed in an office setting under light sedation or local anesthesia.  
  
**Microdebrider** : very rare  
This is a powered rotary shaving device with continuous suction often used during sinus surgery. It is used in performing a partial tonsillectomy, by partially shaving the tonsils. This procedure entails eliminating the obstructive portion of the tonsil while preserving the tonsillar capsule. A natural biologic dressing is left in place over the pharyngeal muscles, preventing injury, inflammation, and infection. The procedure results in less post-operative pain, a more rapid recovery, and perhaps fewer delayed complications. However, the partial tonsillectomy is suggested for enlarged tonsils – not those that incur repeated infections.  
  
**Laser:** more rare now.  
_This is a Hot method and fire hazard._  
**Advantages of using a laser:**  
Minimal operative bleeding due to coagulation of blood vessels <2mm.  
There is reduced post-op pain due to minimal thermal effect.  
Increased accuracy of the surgical wound.  
Quick post-op healing.  
Minimal scarring.  
Preserves the tonsillar pillars.  
Airway fire is another reason why laser tonsillectomy is rarely performed, as the risk is the same if not greater than electrocautery.  
  
**Cold knife techniques (steel) dissection:**  
Removal of the tonsils by use of a basic scalpel. The tonsils are completely removed with minimal post-operative bleeding. However, monopolar cautery or Electrocautery is the preferred method of choice because it causes less bleeding than the scalpel method.  
  
**Guillotine method:  
**The tonsils were removed during olden days using this method. This method has been abandoned because of the risks of bleeding. In this method a guillotine is used to simply chop off the tonsil.  
  
**Carbon dioxide laser:  
**With laser tonsil ablation (LTA), the surgeon uses a hand-held CO2 or KTP laser to vaporize and remove tonsil tissue. Can actually be used under local anesthesia in a doctor’s office. However, due to extensive scarring noted, many surgeons do not use it.  
  
**Radiofrequency ablation** : Monopolar radiofrequency thermal ablation transfers radiofrequency energy to the tonsil tissue through probes inserted in the tonsil.
