Tenckhoff Catheter Placement   

### Tenckhoff Catheter Placement

  
_Edited by Brian Del Grosso MS CRNA_

**General Review:  
**This procedure is similar to the adult version of simply inserting a peritoneal dialysis catheter. The main function of a peritoneal dialysis catheter is to permit consistent bidirectional flow of dialysate without much effort or discomfort. The catheter's function depends upon its design, implantation site, and the configuration of the system used to perform dialysis exchanges.

**The Tenckhoff Catheter can be inserted by 1 of 3 techniques:**  
Open surgical technique  
Percutaneous technique  
Laparoscopic technique  
  
Laparoscopic is the only method that allows for the direct visualization of the intra-peritoneal structures. Laparoscopic insertion has the major advantage of correct catheter positioning in the lower abdomen, with the possibility of adhesiolysis. The minimal invasive percutaneous insertion bears the risk of bowel perforation and catheter malpositioning, and the outcome of this technique is strongly related to the experience of the surgeon.

**Indications:**  
End Stage Renal Disease  
Acute Renal Failure  
Chronic Renal Failure  
Intolerance to Hemodialysis  
Chronic Infections  
Congestive Heart Failure

**Preoperative Considerations:  
**The preoperative preparation of the pediatric renal patient is dependent upon the type of renal disease the patient is presenting with.  
  
**These patients commonly present with:  
**Hypertension  
Anemia  
Edema  
Failure to thrive  
  
**A careful work up:**  
Patient’s medications (diuretics and antihypertensives)  
Prior anesthetic history  
NPO status (higher risk of dehydration depending on length of status)  
Recent infections  
Lab results: electrolytes, calcium, and CBC  
Echocardiogram  
Renal ultrasound  
Renal biopsy  
History of prior dialysis.  
  
It is important to know the patient’s renal diagnosis, for example a patient with chronic renal failure may tolerate a higher serum potassium level versus an acute renal failure patient.  
  
Additionally, in chronic renal failure patients, a platelet count may present normal even though their function may not be (a prolonged bleeding time is the best evaluation of function if you suspect anything such as seeing petechiae).  
  
**Pre-op Versed**  
Practitioner preference with a discussion with the surgical team as well as the parents will aide in making that decision.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
**Chronic renal Failure:** Consider RSI. These patients have an increased risk of aspiration secondary to delayed gastric emptying.

**Induction:** Inhalation or IV  
Studies have shown there is no difference with desflurane and isoflurane, however, keeping low flow sevoflurane in renal patients has led to increased circuit concentrations of compound A.  
  
**If patient has an IV:** Make the patient euvolemic prior to induction.  
These patients are at an increased risk of severe hypotension post induction so caution must be exercised during induction.  
  
Keep in mind anesthetic agents may be affected if the patient is presenting with hypovolemia, anemia, acidosis, and hypoproteinemia.

**Muscle Relaxation:**  
**Cisatracurium (0.1-0.2 mg/kg) and atracurium (0.5 mg/kg)** are the primary agents of choice since they primarily rely on Hoffman elimination.

**Rocuronium (0.6 to 1.2mg/kg)** does not have prolonged duration in children with chronic renal failure, however, there have been studies to demonstrate a prolonged onset of action.

If used it has been recommended by clinicians to use the minimal dose.  
  
**Succinylcholine:** In a cirucumstance in which succinylcholine is needed for emergency airway management or in a child who does not have existing hyperkalemia, a single dose is NOT absolutely contraindicated.

**Positioning:** Supine with slight reverse Trendelenburg and one or two arms tucked.

**Duration:** 45 to 160 minutes

**IV Access:** This case is fairly quick and there is minimal risk of blood loss, however, establishing a decent PIV will help in post surgical fluid management. If the patient doesn’t come with an IV it may be prudent to ask the parents where the patient has had PIV in the past. These patients are very difficult to obtain IV access at baseline and now will present most likely in some form of hypovolemic state.

**Hydration:** Intravenous fluid management is very complex in these patients. Patients have an increased risk of presenting with labile blood pressures, which will require fluid resuscitation however, because of the presence of hypoalbuminemia, and low oncotic pressures they are at an increased risk of pulmonary edema.  
  
**Normal Saline** Just as adults, NS is preferred and avoid LR.  
4:2:1 rule is well tolerated.  
If the patient does present with hypovolemia and is severely labile in blood pressures, giving NS 20ml/kg over 30mins has been effective.  
  
**Albumin 20ml/kg:** Is another common option in these patients.  
In severe cases of labile blood pressure, the use of Dopamine may be the best choice.

**(below is just a common reference)  
**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin - more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**A-Line:** Not needed

**Age Range:** Newborn to Adult

**EBL:** Minimal. However, remember these patients are naturally anemic and may not tolerate much loss.

**Avoid Hypercapnea:** These patients are prone to acidosis which can lead to hyperkalemia and even arrests upon emergence.  
**Note:** Proper communication with the surgeon on timing of the extubation is essential. Some surgeons will fully close and then test the catheter, which they will want the patient to remain under anesthesia.

**Emergence:** All patients should be fully reversed prior to extubation. Keep in mind the elimination of neostigmine may be delayed beyond glycopyrrolate or atropine which may cause increased muscarinic effects such as bradycardia, increased secretions, or bronchospasm.  
  
Stomachs should be emptied as well.  
  
**Extubation:** Extubating the patient with the head slightly elevated is also helpful in order to avoid any aspiration risks. Additionally these patients are at an increased risk of delayed emergence, hypertension, respiratory depression, and pulmonary edema.  
  
**Post Operative Considerations:**  
Bowel Perforation  
Catheter Malposition  
Bleeding  
Dialysate leakage  
Post operative peritonitis

**More Notes:  
**Most catheters are flexible tubes with multiple ports in the distal (intraabdominal) segment which is ideally positioned freely in the intraabdominal pelvic area. The catheter's midportion is normally implanted within the wall of the abdomen via one to two Dacron velour cuffs. With double-cuffed catheters, the deep cuff is imbedded in the abdominal rectus muscle; the superficial cuff in both double cuff and single cuff catheters is placed subcutaneously approximately 2 cm from the catheter exit site on the abdominal wall.

Peritoneal dialysis has several advantages over hemodialysis including quality of life due to its ability to provide better patient mobility and independence, the simplicity of use, as well as the clinical advantages of maintaining residual renal function and lower mortality in the first years after starting peritoneal dialysis. A disadvantage of peritoneal dialysis is the poor blood pressure control due to fluid overload as well as the risk of peritonitis.
