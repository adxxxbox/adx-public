### Beta Blockers and CABG

Perioperative beta blockers are recommended by the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines.  
  
To reduce the incidence and severity of postoperative atrial fibrillation (“A-fib”) in CABG patients who receive beta blockers preoperatively, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons and the American Heart Association recommend that beta blockers be continued postoperatively if no contraindications exist.  
  
One study showed a prophylactic metoprolol reduces the risk of AF after heart surgery. It did not reduce hospital length of stay. Although it is cost effective for the reduction of AF, it did not reduce the overall cost of care.  
  
100-150 mg of Metoprol PO Q day is most commonly prescribed.
