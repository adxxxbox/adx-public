### Cross Clamp Off, Give MgSO4 IV

**Give 2 grams MgSO4 IV** as soon as the aortic cross clamp is off.  
  
Removal of the aortic cross clamp may be followed by ventricular fibrillation. MgSO4 serves as a membrane stabilizer and helps prevent fibrillation. CPB decreases MgSO4 levels.  
  
Once the cross clamp is removed, the coronary arteries are now being re-perfused.
