### Aspirin Reversal

_Currently, there is a lack of specific antidotes for the growing number of new (novel) anticoagulants that are slowly replacing warfarin and heparin. For this reason, there is NO universal standard of care for the treatment of the anticoagulated bleeding patient when there is no specific antidote._

**Consult cardiology for ALL patients with coronary stents.**

**Quick Notes  
**Aspirin is an antiplatelet medication.**T1/2:** 20 min (may reach 15-30 hours when higher doses are ingested).  
Antiplatelet effects begin within one hour of dose and persist 96 hours after stopping therapy.  
Commonly administered with Clopidogrel for patients with cardiac stents.  
  
**Specific antidote:** none.  
  
**Lab Monitoring:** Platelet Function Assay.  
**VerifyNow “Aspirin Test”:** A specific platelet function assay for aspirin.  
**Expected values of VerifyNow Aspirin.  
**Range of 350-700 ARU (Aspirin Reaction Units).

| Results | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| 350-549 ARU | Therapeutic range for platelet function (aspirin is effective) |
| ≤ 549 ARU | Evidence of platelet inhibition due to aspirin |
| 550-700 ARU | No evidence of aspirin-induced platelet inhibition aspirin  
resistance or effects of aspirin have dissipated |

**_Substances known to interfere with the VerifyNow aspirin assay include:_**  
**GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors:** dipyridamole, clopidogrel.  
**NSAIDs:** Ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, indomethacin and piroxicam.  
  
**Initial Treatment  
**Discontinue aspirin or time of last dose.  
Is the patient also taking clopidogrel?  
Mechanical pressure if bleeding exists.  
**Order labs:** Platelet Function Assay.  
**Optional labs:** CBC, BMP and LFT.**  
  
Minor bleeding:**  
**Desmopressin** 0.3mcg/kg x 1 IV (can also be given nasally, both equally effective).  
Desmopressin has been known to increase platelet reactivity in patients treated with aspirin by releasing a greater number of von Willebrand multimers.  
  
**Tranexamic Acid:** Optional x 1.  
**Urgent Surgery  
Order labs:** Platelet Function Assay.**Major bleeding:** Platelet transfusionIf urgent surgery, transfuse platelets at least 90 minutes after the last dose of aspirin to allow it to clear from the circulation.  
  
**Severe Bleed****Order labs:** Platelet Function Assay  
Consult Hematologist Platelet transfusion  
Blood products as needed  
  
**Life-threatening bleed**  
Platelet Function Assay  
Transfuse more platelets.  
Initiate massive transfusion protocols.  
FEIBA 8 to 25 units/kg or Kcentra can be considered.  
  
**Recombinant factor VIIIa** has also been showing promise in reversing aspirin.  
Insufficient evidence exists.  
  
**Optional Treatments**  
Platelets  
DDAVP (Desmopressin): may normalize aspirin-induced coagulopathy.  
  
**Administering Platelets**  
New platelets present will not be affected by the already-metabolized aspirin. They will join ranks with the newest platelets to constitute an improved clotting ability.  
  
_Reiter et al (2007)_ showed that DDAVP improved platelet aggregation from GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors plus aspirin at 1.5 - 2.0 hours after transfusion was stopped.  
  
_(Weingart, 2013):_ Any patient who took anti-platelets agents in last 24 hours (including aspirin and clopidogrel) should receive:  
6 units of platelets (or single-donor packed platelets).  
ddAVP 0.3 mcg/kg x 1 (20 mcg in 50 cc NS over 15-30 mins).  
  
_Campbell et al._ produced a 2010 clinical review of literature regarding emergency reversal of anti-platelet agents and proposed the following algorithm for the management in intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) (whether traumatic or spontaneous in etiology):  
**If patient takes aspirin alone:** give 5 units of platelets.  
**If patient takes any thienopyridine:**  
**Small ICH:** give 10 units of platelets.  
**Large ICH:** give DDAVP and 10 units of platelets; followed by 10 units of platelets q12h x 48 hours.  
  
**Another Regiment Noted**  
Desmopressin: 0.3 mcg/kg every 12 hours for 48 hours IV or intranasally.  
Aspirin: 1 single donor or 5 pooled concentrates of platelets.  
Plavix: 2 single donor or 10 pooled concentrates of platelets.  
  
**Recombinant factor VIIIa** has also been showing promise in reversing aspirin.  
Not enough data.  
  
**More Notes  
**Anti-platelet agents are commonly used by patients, particularly those with history of **CAD or CVA.**  
  
Aspirin is an irreversible COX-1 inhibitor with ineffective metabolites, leading to **short** duration of effect. Clopidogrel has active metabolites, leading to a **longer** duration of effect.  
  
**Thienopyridines** (clopidogrel, ticlopidine, prasugrel): class of drugs that acts as an **ADP-receptor inhibitor.** These drugs have active metabolites leading to a longer duration of effect of up to 5-7 days (Beshay, 2010).  
  
DDAVP (desmopressin): thought to contribute to platelet activation pathway by promoting vWF production. Side effects may include hyponatremia, seizures, and elevated ICP (Campbell, 2010).
