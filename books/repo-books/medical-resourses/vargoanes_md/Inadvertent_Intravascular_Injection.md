**Unintentional intravascular injection:  
**Early detection is paramount.  
Blood is often seen immediately in the epidural needle hub or the catheter once threaded.  
Always aspirate before injecting your test dose. (If intravenous, blood is often, but not always, detected prior to injecting the test dose.)  
If intravenous, an increase in heart rate (20-30bpm) will be seen within the first minute.  
Remove the catheter and attempt replacement at another interspace.  
Pt may also describe tinnitus, metallic taste, circumoral numbness or altered hearing.  
  
The risk of serious complications related to an intravascular injection when performing a spinal anesthetic is almost non-existent due to the small amount of local anesthetic required to induce anesthesia.  
The risk of serious complications lies with the administration of epidural or caudal anesthesia. This is due to the relatively large amounts of local anesthetic administered. Toxicity affects the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. Several factors affect the potential response to large doses of local anesthetics and include type of local anesthetic, rate of injection, and acid-base balance. The first factor is the type of local anesthetic. Local anesthetics vary in their potential to cause toxicity.  
**The least to most toxic local anesthetic from top to bottom** Chloroprocaine - least  
Lidocaine  
Levobupivacaine  
Ropivacaine  
Bupivacaine - most**  
  
Rate of injection is a second factor  
**The faster the injection rate, the smaller amount of local anesthetic medication required to cause signs and symptoms of toxicity.  
**Acid base balance is a third factor**  
**Respiratory acidosis:** Patients that are experiencing respiratory acidosis (decreased pH and increased CO2) will have a lower threshold for convulsions. Hypercarbia will increase cerebral blood flow which allows the brain to have a greater uptake of local anesthetic molecules.  
  
**Metabolic acidosis** : On the other hand, metabolic acidosis (increased pH and increased CO2) does not lower the threshold as significantly. Ion trapping occurs due to a decrease in pH and an increase in the cationic form of the local anesthetic which keeps the molecules from diffusing across nerve membranes.  
  
**Combined metabolic and respiratory acidosis (** hypercarbia/acidosis) decreases the ability of local anesthetics to bind with proteins which increases the amount of local anesthetic available for diffusion into the CNS.  
  
**Cardiovascular effects with intravascular injection**  
**Cardiovascular effects include  
**Alteration of electrical and mechanical activity  
Directly affects the cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle.  
  
Local anesthetics that are very lipid soluble, extensively protein bound, and potent are more likely to cause cardiotoxic reactions (Bupivacaine, Tetracaine, and Etidocaine) than agents that are less lipid soluble, protein bound, and potent (Lidocaine, Mepivacaine, and Prilocaine).  
  
**Electrical conduction** \- inhibition of NA channels will depress electrical conduction, rate of depolarization of Purkinje’s fibers, action potential duration, and refractory period. Bupivacaine has the greatest depressant effect on the electrical conduction system.  
  
**Cardiac dysrhythmias** \- caused primarily by bupivacaine, followed by etidocaine and ropivacaine. The result includes ventricular fibrillation. Lidocaine, mepivacaine, and tetracaine rarely cause ventricular fibrillation.  
  
**Myocardial contractility** \- there is a dose dependent negative effect on the inotropic actions of the heart. The greatest degree of depression occurs with bupivacaine, tetracaine, and etidocaine.  
  
**Moderate depression occurs** with lidocaine, mepivacaine, and prilocaine.  
  
**The least potent local anesthetics** include procaine and chloroprocaine.  
  
**Signs and symptoms associated with high blood concentrations of local anesthetics include the following:  
**Hypotension  
Arrhythmias  
Cardiovascular collapse  
Seizures  
Unconsciousness  
  
**How to Prevent Inadvertent Intravascular Injection**  
Use of a test dose prior to the injection of local anesthetic  
Careful aspiration prior to injection  
Incremental dosing  
Vigilant monitoring for early signs and symptoms  
  
**Early symptoms  
**Increase in heart rate (if using an epinephrine containing solution)  
Tinnitus  
Funny or metallic taste  
Changes in mental status  
  
If the patient experiences early symptoms, stop the administration of local anesthetics. Anticipate impending complications such as seizures, hypotension, and cardiac arrest.  
  
The use of lipids in the treatment of local anesthetic toxicity has shown promise.

Prepare the appropriate medications and equipment. Next, re-evaluate the placement. If there is any doubt about proper placement, simply remove the epidural catheter and once symptoms have abated, replace the catheter.
