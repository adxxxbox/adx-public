### Low Molecular Weight Heparins (LMWH) Review

Do NOT confuse unfractionated heparin (UFH) with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)!  
  
**Facts of LMWH and why it is preferred over UFH**  
Can be administered at home (heparin is usually restricted to the hospital setting).More predictable and reliable than heparin.  
LMWH have a greater bioavailability.  
Do not need routine monitoring; there is no therapeutic range.  
Dosing adjustments to reach a target is not recommended.  
LMWH is too small to inactivate Thrombin and only has anti-factor Xa activity.  
More expensive.  
Only partially reversed with Protamine.  
Have reduced anti-factor IIa activity relative to anti-factor Xa activity, more favorable benefit-risk ratios.  
Have a lesser effect on the aPTT as they are reduced in molecular size, while still inhibiting activated factor X (factor Xa).  
  
**Lower incidence of HIT:** Less binding to macrophages and endothelial cells increases the plasma half-life of LMWH compared with UFH, whereas reduced binding to platelets and PF4 may explain the lower incidence of HIT.  
  
**Three LMWHs are currently available in the US: (More coming soon)**  
Enoxaparin (Lovenox).  
Dalteparin (Fragmin).  
Tinzaparin (Innohep).  
  
**Other LMWHs**  
Certoparin (Embolex).  
Nadroparin (Fraxiparin).  
Reviparin (Clivarin).  
Parnaparin Sodium (Barnaparin Sodium).  
Bemiparin Sodium (Ardeparin Sodium) 2 nd generation of LMWH.  
  
**2 nd Generation LMWH:  
**Have the lowest molecular weight, the longest half-life and the highest anti-Factor Xa/anti-Factor IIa activity ratio.  
  
**How LMWHs are Produced**  
LMWHs are derived from unfractionated heparin (UFH) by various chemical or physical depolymerization techniques to yield fragments approximately 1/3 the size of heparin.  
Chain reduction results in 5 main changes in its properties; all are due to reduced binding of LMWH to proteins or cells.  
  
LMWH produces less microvascular bleeding than heparin in experimental models.  
The effects of natural, or unfractionated heparin are more unpredictable than LMWH.  
  
**Indications of LMWHs**  
Prevention blood clots and treatment of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) and in the treatment of myocardial infarction.  
  
Heparin and LMWHs are both administered in lower doses for primary prophylaxis than for treatment of venous thrombosis or acute myocardial ischemia.  
  
**Mechanisms of Action**  
LMWH binds to anti-thrombin III and creates a conformational change. This change accelerates INHIBITION of activated factor Xa.  
  
Factor Xa catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.  
  
LMWH’s inhibition of this process results in decreased thrombin and ultimately the prevention of fibrin clot formation.  
  
**LMWH Heparin and HIT**  
Platelet activation/aggregation can occur from LMWHs in the presence of most pre-existing HIT antibodies that had been generated from previous UFH exposure, although the response is less than that caused by UFH plus HIT antibody.  
  
With the expanded use of LMWH, the frequency of clinical HIT may naturally decline, given that LMWHs are less likely to generate HIT antibody.  
  
**LMWH and Aspirin**  
The rate of acute MI, recurrent angina, and urgent coronary revascularization was significantly lower with the LMWH and aspirin combination than with UFH and aspirin or aspirin alone.  
  
LMWH preparations are at least as effective and safe as UFH and more convenient, although they have the disadvantage of expense. The higher cost of the drug itself cannot be considered in isolation, however, because savings from SC administration and reduced hospital stay offset this.  
  
The efficacy and safety of LMWH might be improved by monitoring anti-factor Xa levels, but the anticipated improvement in clinical outcome would likely be marginal and balanced by inconvenience and added expense.  
**Lab monitoring:** No routinely monitored.  
**Optional labs:** anti-factor Xa assay and platelet monitoring.  
  
**AntiXa Activity (LMWXA) and aPTT monitoring with LMWH (when needed)**  
If measuring is desired, check peak antiXa level 3-4 hours after dose.  
Observed peak AntiXa levels for Q12h dosing of LMWHs = 0.5-1 units/mL.  
Observed peak antiXa levels for Q24h dosing of LMWHs = 1-2 units per mL.  
You can also check trough antiXa levels prior to the next dose = <0.5 units/mL.  
Elevated troughs suggest impaired clearance.  
aPTT displays a linear dose-respone to LMWH but, there is still variations.  
  
**Reference Range(s)**  
UFH Therapeutic Range: 0.30-0.70.  
  
**LMWH Therapeutic Ranges (target anti-Xa levels measured 4 hours after dosing):**  
**Enoxaparin (Lovenox)**  
Therapeutic bid dosing 0.6-1.0.  
Therapeutic qd dosing >1.0.  
  
**Tinzaparin (Innohep):**  
Therapeutic qd dosing 0.85.  
  
**Dalteparin (Fragmin):**  
Therapeutic qd dosing 1.05.  
  
**Heparin (UFH) has longer chains than LMWHs**  
Heparin is a naturally occurring polysaccharide.  
Heparin molecular chains vary in lengths, or molecular weights.  
Heparin chains of varying from 5000 to over 40,000 daltons  
LMWHs, in contrast, consist of only short chains of polysaccharide.  
LMWH have an average molecular weight < 8000 daltons.  
LMWHs have a mean molecular weight of 4000 to 5000 daltons, with a molecular weight distribution of 1000 to 10 000 daltons.  
  
Compared with UFH, LMWHs have higher anti-Xa/anti-IIa ratios, which are typically between 2.0 and 4.0, depending on the mix of chain lengths and the molecular weight of individual preparations.  
  
Each LMWH product has a specific molecular weight distribution that determines its anticoagulant activity and duration of action, so one product cannot always be substituted for another.

| Anticoagulant | Mean Molecular Mass | Anti FXa/FIIa(anti-FXa IU/mg) | Anti FXa/FIIa ratiio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UFH | 15 kDa | 193/193 | 1 |
| Tinzaprin (Innohep) | 6.8 kDa | 90/45 | 2.0 |
| Dalteparin (Fragmin) | 6.0 kDa | 130/52 | 2.5 |

| Fondaparinux (Arixtra)  
See note below. | 1.7 kDa | 930/0 |  |

**Note-fondaparinux (Arixtra)** is an anticoagulant that shares the same pentasaccharide sequence as UFH and LMWH for the binding to antithrombin, however it has no extra chain and thus, is not considered a heparin product. It is also known to not cause HIT, as seen with UFH and LMWH.  
  
**Low Molecular Weight Heparin Reversal of Bleeding  
**Some literature states that protamine sulfate only binds to long heparin chains and is thus ineffective against LMWH. Actually, protamine may be of use in reversing bleeding associated with LMWH but not in all patients. protamine only partially affects anti-Xa levels.  
  
**If a LMWH has been administered within 4 hours:** 1 mg of protamine for each 1 mg of enoxaparin or 100 units of dalteparin and tinzaparin.  
  
Repeat one half dose of protamine in 4 hours.  
  
**If LMWH has been administered within 4-8 hours after dose:** 0.5 mg for each 1 mg of enoxaparin or 100 units of dalteparin and tinzaparin.
