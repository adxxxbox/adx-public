### Epidural Dosing of Mepivacaine (Carbocaine)

Mepivacaine is not used in OB since it was reported to have a long half-life in neonates (9 hours vs lidocaine of 3 hours)  
  
**Duration:** 15-30 minutes longer than lidocaine  
Epinephrine prolongs its action by 50%  
Mepivacaine is an intermediate acting, amide local anesthetic.
