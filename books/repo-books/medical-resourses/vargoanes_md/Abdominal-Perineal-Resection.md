### Abdominal-Perineal Resection (APR)  
Also known as Pelvic Exenteration

**This is a BIG LONG CASE**  
The APR is the most extensive pelvic surgery. Usually done when cancer of the cervix (or other cancers) has recurred after surgery or radiation therapy. The bladder, urethra, rectum, and anus are removed. In women, the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and in some cases the vulva are also removed.  
In men, the prostate is also removed.  
A urinary diversion and colostomy are also performed. These procedures are also commonly performed with regional flaps from the thigh or abdomen by a plastic surgeon.  
**Anesthesia:** General/ETT  
**Position:** Supine, lithotomy followed by prone Jack-knife.  
**A-line:** Yes, due to the prolonged duration of the case.  
**Epidural:** Sometimes, for post op pain.  
**Duration:** 6-10 hours  
**EBL:** Depends on the surgeon. 250-750mLs is common.  
**Type and Cross:** Yes, with 2 units on stand-by.  
**A-line:** Yes  
**Labs:** Check coags and CBC.  
**NG Tube:** Yes  
**IV Access:** 2 18G; 16G would be better.  
**CVP:** Rarely anymore.  
**Warming Blankets:** Yes  
**Fluid Warmer:** Yes  
  
**Possible Complications**  
Some of these cases are now being done laparoscopically which means less EBL, etc. They make a larger incision to remove the uterus.  

Currently, operative mortality rates are 3-5%. The major perioperative complication rate is 30-44%, and the overall 5-year survival rate in patients who successfully undergo the procedure is 20-50%.
