### Glossectomy (Partial or Total)

A **Glossectomy** is the surgical removal of all or part of the tongue.  
**Hemiglossectomy**: One side of the tongue is removed.  
**Partial Glossectomy**: Removal of part of the tongue.  
**Total Glossectomy:** Removal of the whole tongue.  
**Indication:** For tongue cancer. 95% of these cases are for a Squamous Cell carcinoma.   
   
**Anesthetic:** General, usually nasally intubated. Sometimes an oral ETT if the tumor is in a convenient location for the surgeon.  
**Intubation:** If there is a large tumor, consider the Glide Scope or traditional fiberoptic.  
**Muscle relaxation:** Yes.   
**Position:** Supine with arms to the side. The bed usually rotated 90-180 degrees.  
**Antisialogogue:** Yes; use Robinul.  
**Throat pack:** Yes.  
**NGT for later feedings:** Only if it’s a complete glossectomy or large excision. Remember, the tongue is also used for swallowing.   
**Antiemetics:** Yes.  
**Decadron:** Yes.  
**Slight Hypotension:** Yes, the tongue is vascular. Keep MAP 60-70 mmHg or within 20% of the base MAP.  
**Type and Cross:** Depends on the surgeon. With an experienced surgeon using the CO2 laser or electrocautery, there is only a little blood loss. However, the procedure may be combined with a radical neck.  
**Tracheostomy:** Sometimes, but rare.  
**EBL:** 10-50 ccs. Minimal with the CO2 laser.  
**Notes and Facts  
Robotic:** Some surgeons are now trying to do these procedures with the robot. The bed will be rotated.  
Squamous Cell Cancer (SCC) of the tongue generally presents in the fifth and sixth decade of life and is more common in males.  
  
Smoking tobacco and ethanol abuse are strongly associated with the development of SCC of the tongue, and patients who abuse both tobacco and ethanol have a 6-fold to 15-fold increased risk of developing cancer. Many of these are done with a neck resection.

If they can’t close the resection, they can use a skin graft form the wrist, forearm or thigh.

Speech and swallowing abilities are usually maintained if at least one-third of the tongue remains. A complete Glossectomy is rare. Most are partial.

Omni Guide CO2 Laser offers a lesser degree of collateral tissue damage. Transoral Robotic Surgery (TORS) is another method. The patient is usually nasally intubated, or an oral Rae is possible if the case is a partial Glossectomy.  

If the entire tongue needs to be removed, this is a more complicated surgery. Sometimes the lymph nodes in the neck will also need to be removed. It is common for the patient’s post-op to include nutrition through an NGT until they can swallow. The patient works with a speech therapist to learn to speak and swallow after surgery.

**Anatomy:** From anterior to posterior, the tongue has 3 surfaces: tip, body, and base. The 8 muscles of the human tongue are classified as either intrinsic or extrinsic.  
The 4 intrinsic muscles act to change the shape of the tongue and are not attached to any bone. The 4 extrinsic muscles act to change the position the tongue and are anchored to bone. They are the genioglossus, hyoglossus, styloglossus, and palatoglossus.

**Vascular supply**  
The tongue receives its blood supply primarily from the lingual artery, a branch of the external carotid artery. The secondary blood supply to the tongue is from the tonsillar branch of the facial artery and the ascending pharyngeal artery.

MRI is sufficiently accurate to determine tumor thickness of the oral cavity SCC, although histologic evaluation remains the standard.
