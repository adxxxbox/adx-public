### Cystoplasty (Bladder Augmentation)

Open Belly Procedure or Laparoscopic

Cystoplasty is a reconstructive surgery to increase the bladder reservoir capacity and lower the increased intra-bladder pressure. A tissue graft is anastomosed to the bladder.  
**3 types of anastomosis**  
Ilium: ileocystoplasty  
Stomach:gastrocystoplasty  
Ureter: ureterocystoplasty

Usually done with kids and adults who have inadequate or abnormal bladder capacity or poor detrusor muscle compliance.  

**Anesthesia:** General/ETT  
**Epidural**: Sometimes for post op pain.  
**Pediatric:** Caudal block for post op pain  
**Duration:** 3-8 hours  
**Position:** Supine  
**Foley catheter:** Yes  
**IV Access:** 1-2 18G  
**A-line:** Optional, mostly because it can be a really long case and possible blood loss.  
**EBL:** Minimal   
**Hypothermia Risk**: Yes, so consider a fluid warmer and warming blanket.  
**NGT or OGT:** Yes, when the small or large intestines are used.  
  
**Possible Complications**  
Around 6% of patients who undergo augmentation cystoplasty experience perforation.  
Ilium perforation  
Sigmoid colon perforation  
Sepsis and death from perforation  
Decreased abdominal sensation  
Stone formation, both of the kidney and of the bladder, occurs in up to 50% of patients after augmentation.  
Hypercontractility and hypocontractility of urinary bladder  
Incontinence  
Hematuria/dysuria syndrome
