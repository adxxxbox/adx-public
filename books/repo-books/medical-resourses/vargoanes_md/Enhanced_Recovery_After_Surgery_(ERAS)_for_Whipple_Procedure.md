### Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) for Whipple Procedure

**Note:** ERAS protocols vary among institutions  
Confirm case posting for ERAS  
  
**Room set-up and preparation**  
**Equipment:**  
Non-invasive CO monitor and patient attachments.  
Braun IV infusion pump and pump tubing  
Epidural kit  
Epidural placement: Targeted T9 – 0.0625% bupivacaine  
Know patient’s HCT and have RBCs on standby.  
  
**Meds to draw up**  
Ketamine 50 mg  
Magnesium 2gm (mixed in 100 mL bag) over 10 minutes  
Antibiotic prophylaxis (per protocol)  
Dexamethasone 10 mg  
Midazolam (Versed®) 2mg IV  
Fentanyl 100 mcg  
IV acetaminophen (Ofirmev®) (if patient has not received oral acetaminophen pre-op)  
  
**Ambulatory care unit (ACU) hand-off  
**Review chart to determine if the patient has taken celocoxib (Celebrex®) or acetaminophen (Tylenol®). Avoid acetaminophen (Ofirmev®) and ketorolac (Toradol®) if already taken.  
Standard pre-procedure check-off  
Confirm pump tubing and fluids on pump at 25 ml/hr in ACU  
Confirm patient received 1,000 mL IV fluid bolus  
Limit pre-op sedation: < 2mg midazolam IV  
ERAS post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) prophylaxis (scopolamine)  
ERAS multimodal analgesics (gabapentin)  
Confirm deep venous thrombosis (VTE) /deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis (sequential compression device /subcutaneous heparin if indicated (if epidural placed, >1 hr after placement)  
Confirm that perioperative glycemic control order set has been activated  
Epidural placement  
Fluid warmer and blood tubing for possible blood transfusion  
  
**Intra-op, prior to incision**  
60 ml syringe of normal saline for flush  
Ketamine 40mg IV at induction (no fentanyl)  
Magnesium 2gm IV (over 10 min)  
Antibiotic prophylaxis (per protocol)  
Acetaminophen 1 g IV (15 mg/kg)  
Dexamethasone 10 mg IV  
Ketamine 0.5mg/kg IV Q1 hour to a maximum of 160 mg  
IV acetaminophen (Ofirmev®)1 gram if acetaminophen not administered pre-op  
Establish fluid administration as directed by institutional protocol  
Forced air warming blanket (after prep and drape)  
Epidural bolus  
**Note:** If not contraindicated, consider induction with rocuronium in preference to succinylcholine to avoid abdominal muscle activity during transverse abdominis plane (TAP) blocks.  
  
**Intra-op and maintenance  
**500 ml crystalloid bolus or 250 mL of 5% albumin if needed as directed by institutional protocol.   
**Note:** Many anesthesia providers start the 500 cc bolus using the pump (flow rate 999 ml/hr with 500ml volume to be infused–VTBI) prior to induction.  
**Ventilator:** Pressure controlled ventilation with tidal volume 6ml/kg  
Maintain normothermia.  
Limit fentanyl to 100 mcg if possible.  
  
**Blood Glucose Monitoring**  
**Diabetic patient**  
Baseline check 60 minutes post induction or 60 minutes after last check in ACU (diabetic patients).   
Check blood sugars Q 1 hour and follow institution sliding scale.   
  
**Non-diabetic patients** :  
Check blood sugar within 60 minutes after induction.   
Maintain blood glucose between 100-180 mg/dl.   
Check blood glucose Q2hr (“finger stick” or other sampling technique).   
  
**Closing and emergence**  
Ondansetron (Zofran®) 4mg IV  
Awake extubation in the OR  
Ketorolac is usually not administered due to surgical blood loss associated with this procedure.  
  
**Post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) hand-off  
**Inform PACU RN that ERAS protocol was followed.  
Report last blood glucose measurement, time and intervention.  
Report last antibiotic dose and time.  
Report acetaminophen /ketamine dose and time.  
SCDs from PACU arrival until discharge–while in bed or chair.  
  
**Postoperative epidural management:**  
Infusion 6-10 ml/hr 0.0625% bupivacaine.   
**  
Rescue analgesia:**  
1st: epidural dose per anesthesia provider.   
2nd: fentanyl per anesthesia provider order.  
3rd: ketamine 20 mg IV.
