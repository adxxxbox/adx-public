## Cardiovascular Notes

Cardiac output- is HR dominant not determined on SV

So a bradycardia causes profound reduction in cardiac output

Resting stroke volume in neonate is only 1ml/kg/min

Cardiac Output at birth-200ml/kg/min, this decreases to 100ml/kg/min by adolescence

Stroke volume is fairly constant due to the LV being noncompliant and poorly developed

Starling response is limited

After load compensation is limited

Contractility is reduced

Ventricular interdependence is high

Neonates are more prone to biventricular failure because of the poorly developed ventricles and sensitive to volume loading. Be careful. That’s why we use Buretrols.

Normal HR in neonate is 150bpm

Parasympathetic system fully developed and dominant

Sympathetic nervous system and baroreceptors-reflex not fully mature

More prone to bradycardia

Vasoconstrictor-response to bleeding and hypovolemia is less

Hb 19g/% at 8-12 weeks Initial HCT around 55%

10-11g/% at 2-3 months (physiologic anemia) HCT around 30
