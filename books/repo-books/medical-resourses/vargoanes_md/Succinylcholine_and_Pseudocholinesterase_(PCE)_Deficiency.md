### Succinylcholine (SCh) and Pseudocholinesterase (PCE) Deficiency

Pseudocholinesterase Deficiency is also known as:

-   Butyrylcholinesterase (BTHE) Deficiency
-   Plasma Cholinesterase Deficiency
-   Cholinesterase II Deficiency
-   Succinylcholine Sensitivity
-   Suxamethonium Sensitivity

PCE Deficiency:

A disorder caused by atypical or deficiency of PCE leading to prolonged paralysis after administration of succinylcholine or mivacurium.

PCE:

-   The enzyme that metabolizes 90 % of the succinylcholine in the plasma before the remaining 10% reaches the neuromuscular junction.
-   It is produced in the liver.
-   It has a plasma half-life of 8 to 12 days.

Besides the liver, PCE is located in:

-   Plasma
-   Erythrocytes
-   Glial tissue
-   Pancreas
-   Bowel

Clinical suspicion for PCE deficiency:

-   Any patient with prolonged paralysis (>10 minutes) after succinylcholine administration.
-   A nerve stimulator helps confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating the flaccidity of hand muscles.
-   The suspicion of homozygous deficiency of PCE occurs when it takes hours to return fully from muscle relaxation.

Note: Anticholinesterases (neostigmine, edrophonium) and sugammadex are ineffective in reversing muscle relaxation from a depolarizing agent (succinylcholine).

Management:

-   Keep the patient sedated with either propofol or dexmedetomidine until extubated.
-   Respiratory support with mechanical ventilation until the spontaneous resolution of neuromuscular blockade.
-   These patients have a full recovery and are extubated with the full return of muscle relaxation.

Genetics:

-   Inherited PCE deficiency is a genetic condition caused by mutations in the BCHE gene.
-   The BCHE gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 3, specifically at position 3q26.1-q26.2.

Other names for the BCHE gene:

-   acylcholine acylhydrolase
-   butyrylcholinesterase
-   CHE1
-   CHE2
-   cholinesterase (serum) 2
-   E1
-   pseudocholinesterase E1

Mutations:

More than 50 different mutations in the BCHE gene have been identified that may lead to a pseudocholinesterase deficiency.

Autosomal Recessive disorder:

-   PCE deficiency is an autosomal recessive enzyme disorder caused by a harmful genetic variants in the BCHE gene.
-   Because it is an autosomal recessive disorder, an individual must inherit a mutated copy of the gene from BOTH parents to have the deficiency.

**Carriers:** Heterozygous

-   Individuals with only one mutated copy are called heterozygotes.
-   They may process certain succinylcholine and mivacron more slowly than average, but typically, they do not experience the severe, prolonged effects seen in homozygous individuals with the full deficiency.

The inherited defect may result in either:

-   Presence of an atypical PCE (heterozygous)
-   Complete absence of the PCE (homozygous)

Heterozygous:

-   It involves only one gene coding for the abnormal enzyme
-   Dibucaine number 40-80
-   1:480 people
-   Succinylcholine or Mivacron will have an increased muscle relaxation duration for seconds to minutes if at all.
-   Literature varies on duration as it is patient-dependent.

Homozygous PCE deficiency:

-   Involves both genes coding for the defective pseudocholinesterase
-   Dibucaine number < 30:
-   1:3,500 people
-   Succinylcholin or Mivacron will cause muscle relaxation for several hours.
-   Literature varies on duration as it is patient dependent.

Acquired PCE deficiency:

In rare cases, PCE deficiency can be acquired due to factors such as liver disease, malnutrition, or other medications.

Frequency is higher among:

-   Caucasians from North America, Great Britain, Portugal, Yugoslavia, and Greece
-   Caucasians, males are affected almost twice as often as females.
-   Jews from Iran and Iraq (Persian people of the Jewish community)
-   A subset of Alaska Natives

The frequency of the deficiency is lower among:

-   Black people
-   Japanese and non-Japanese Orientals
-   South Americans
-   Australian aborigines
-   Arctic Inuits (in general).

Differential diagnosis for pseudocholinesterase deficiency includes, but is not limited to:

-   Narcotic overdose
-   Residual neuromuscular blockade
-   Cholinergic crisis
-   Myasthenia gravis
-   Myasthenic syndrome
-   Hypermagnesemia
-   Hypophosphatemia
-   Hypokalemia
