### Amicar (Aminocaproic Acid) Notes

In this context it is used to prevent bleeding after heart surgery.  
There are many different ways to infuse it. Protocols vary among institutions.  
  
**Two Common Methods of giving Amicar during a heart procedure**  
Anesthesia team boluses twice and perfusionist gives a bolus while on pump.  
  
15 grams total  
5 grams post induction bolus by anesthesia  
5 grams by perfusionist bolus by perfusionist  
5 grams post protamine bolus by anesthesia  
  
**_A simplified method uses slow IV push 5 grams drip at then infusion of 50cc/hr_**  
5 vials of Amicar to 150 ml bag = 100 mg/ml.  
Loading dose is 0.5 ml/kg over 30 min.  
followed by 0.25 ml/kg/hr until post op.  
Given to reduce fibrinolysis and bleeding after CPB.  
Do not infuse Amicar into the same line as blood.  
  
Amicar is given after induction during open heart surgery and finished at the end of the case or in cardiac recovery.  
Amicar’’s competitor aprotinin is no longer on the market in the US.  
  
**Method of Action**  
Inhibits activation of plasminogen, reducing conversion of plasminogen to plasmin (fibrinolysin). Prevents the breakdown of fibrin clots.  
  
It also directly inhibits plasmin activity, but higher doses are required than are needed to reduce plasmin formation.

In patients with upper urinary tract bleeding, administration of aminocaproic acid has been known to cause intra-renal obstruction in the form of glomerular capillary thrombosis, or clots in the renal pelvis and ureters. For this reason, aminocaproic acid should not be used in hematuria of upper urinary tract origin, unless the possible benefits outweigh the risk.  
  
Rapid intravenous injection of undiluted aminocaproic acid is not recommended.  
  
Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination. Sixty-five percent of the dose is recovered in the urine as unchanged drug and 11% of the dose appears as the metabolite adipic acid.  
  
Renal clearance (116 ml/min) approximates endogenous creatinine clearance.  
  
The total body clearance is 169 mL/min. The terminal elimination half-life for Amicar is approximately two hours.  
  
**Availability and Cost**  
Generic aminocaproic acid 20ml approximately $1.  
Aprotinin: approximately $600 per 200ml bottle.
