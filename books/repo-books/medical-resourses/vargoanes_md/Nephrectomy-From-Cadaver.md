### Nephrectomy- Cadaver Multi-Organ Donor

These are usually done in conjunction with multiple organ retrieval of the heart, lungs, liver and pancreas. Don’t worry about figuring out hemodynamics and/or vent settings. The Procurement Team has their protocols and will inform you.  
We are not present when the kidneys are removed. The kidneys are last. Our anesthesia is complete once the heart and lungs are cross clamped. The kidneys are already cold and flushed so there is no warm ischemia. You can turn off the ventilator and leave. Remember to open the pop-off valve when the ventilator is off. And turn the oxygen flow off as well.

Surgical techniques differ depending on what organs are being removed. Certain principals are the same.

Concerning the kidneys, the surgeon wants you to AVOID hypotension and high doses of vasopressors. They both can decrease renal blood flow and contribute to acute tubular necrosis and delayed graft function post-transplantation.  
  
**Anesthetic**: General: the patient is already intubated upon arrival from the ICU.  
**Position:** Supine, a small rolled towel may be placed between the shoulder blades, and the neck can then be hyperextended to facilitate median sternotomy. A long incision is made from the suprasternal notch to the symphysis pubis bone.  
**A-Line:** yes, already in.  
**CVP:** Yes, many patients already have a central line and transducer from the ICU. If the patient does not already have one, we usually don’t put one in.  
**Bair Hugger:** Yes, lower body; especially for multi organs.  
**IV Access:** Already in, and usually a central line.  
**Pre-Operative Fluid loading:** There should already be an ongoing protocol from the ICU.  
**Intra operative Crystalloids:** Anticipate 3-5 liters crystalloid for the entire case. Some literature states that you should give 4 units of blood to protect the organs. However, most of us replace blood loss with crystalloids. Adjust flow rates as needed to maintain urinary output of 50-100 ccs hourly. Almost everything is based on the transplant protocol.  
**OGT:** Yes, surgeons will want the stomach deflated.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Yes, Zemuron or Norcuron is OK.  
**Foley Catheter:** Yes  
**Urinary Output:** Check it Q15 minutes and inform the surgeon. It should be at least 2ml/minute until the ureter is transected. Some protocols are 100mL/hr. After the ureter is transected, the UO should fall to l ml/minute from the remaining kidney.  
**Mannitol:** give 12.5 grams prior to vascular dissection (clamping) and after volume administration (3-4 liters). The surgeon will tell you when to administer it.  
**Neo Drip:** Sometimes; use sparingly.  
**Lasix:** Sometimes you will be asked to administer it.  
**Dopamine 1-3mcg/kg/min:** Avoid high infusion rates of pressors that may cause renal vasoconstriction. The patient may already be on this drip. Recall that low dose Dopamine will help the kidneys.  
**Colloids:** 1 Liter is suggested. Some protocols say “NO.”  
**BIS indexing:** Not needed; the patient has no cerebral activity.  
Duration: 3-4 hours.

**Sympathetic Tone**:Some literature states that brain dead cadavers lose sympathetic tone and have no response to surgical stimuli. Other studies and personal experience show that the heart rate and blood pressure responses to surgical stimuli DO occur, especially with incision. Many could argue this.

**More Notes**  
In the event of a cardiovascular collapse, the aorta can be cannulated, the kidneys perfused, and the dissection quickly completed, thus avoiding injury to the kidneys.

The kidneys can be removed individually, but many routines remove both kidneys en bloc or all together with the aorta and vena cava. Separation and cleaning of the kidneys is done in a basin with ice slush.

After cross clamping, the organs are removed in the following order: heart, lungs, liver, pancreas and kidneys.

If the surgeons are retrieving the lungs, a lung surgeon at one point will invade your anesthesia space to perform a bronchoscopy.

Maintenance of CV and UOP stability is important.

Normal renal function is verified through UO, and stat labs: BUN, serum creatinine and urinalysis.

Removal of the pancreas, liver, or heart in addition to kidneys requires a meticulous dissection. Ischemia is not tolerated and the organs cannot be protected in case of cardiac arrest or cardiovascular collapse. Therefore, it is critical for careful fluid and electrolyte replacement and monitoring of the cardiovascular status. Blood loss early in the procedure must be replaced with blood. Keep the patient warm. Temperature monitoring and control is essential.

Cadaver donors of whom the kidneys alone are to be removed are sometimes managed without anesthesia support.

Once the abdominal viscera are flushed with a preservation solution, the kidney dissection is carried out in a bloodless field. The ureters are transected distally as close to the bladder as possible.
