### CT (CAT or Computed Tomography Scan) Anesthesia

**_Edited by Lauren Freedman, CRNA St Petersburg, FL_**  
  
CAT Scans are performed for many reasons ranging from the diagnosis of the head, abdomen and chest to procedures such as CT guided abscess drainage, drain placement or biopsies.

The most important preparation for a CT is to know the exact procedure.

**Ask the CT Technician:**  
\- Duration  
\- Position  
\- Any breath holding? ETT and muscle relaxation may be required  
\- Contrast needed? An antecubital IV may be required  
\- Urgency of procedure  
\- NPO status  
\- How many other cases are following and the ages of the patients

**Room Set-Up**  
**Airway Equipment: Always have the following immediately available  
**\-Appropriate sized ETTs for each case  
\-Appropriate LMAs and oral airways.

\-Appropriate sized masks for your patient.  
\-Suction  
\-Ambu bag or Baby Safe device**  
  
IV Equipment:**

\-22g IV catheters, ETOH swabs, tegaderm, tape, 4x4 gauze elastic coband  
\-Have available for the IV starter during mask induction  
\-Find out if contrast is needed and if a certain extremity is preferred.  
\-Primed IV tubing, usually 500cc bag with micro tubing, for each case  
  

**Emergency drugs:** Anectine and atropine

**Anesthetic options for a straight forward plain CT Scan:  
**\-Very short in duration  
\-Usually just wrapping the patient in a papoose like device or waiting for a little one to fall asleep.

\-There is no need to expose a patient to an unneeded anesthetic.  
  
**Ketamine Dart:**  
\-Mix a syringe of ketamine 5-10mg/kg with 0.2mg robunul and 1-2 mg midazolam

\-A 22g or 20g needle to the thigh or deltoid  
\-A nasal cannula with ECO2 capabilities and emergency equipment at bedside

  
**For longer CTs** :  
\-For CT guided drain placement and abscess drainage the anesthesia plan depends on the positioning and risk for aspiration.  
**  
Prone, lateral, or manipulation by the radiologist:**  
\-General with ETT  
  
**Supine Position:**  
\-LMA is appropriate as long as breath holding is not needed  
\-If breath holding is required, general/ETT with a muscle relaxant  
  
**Quick Biopsy:  
**ETCO2 NC, Versed and propofol. Administer propofol just prior to the local incision.
