Wilms Tumor and Anesthesia-Nephrectomy   

### Wilms' Tumor and Anesthesia - Nephrectomy

**(Also read “Wilms' Tumor – Notes and Facts”)**

The first thing you need to do is find out more about your patient. Most of these kids have NO other symptoms and your case is just a basic nephrectomy.

Age range is 1-5 years old.  
Average age is 3 years old.

You need to find out if your patient has associated anomalies? This can change your anesthetic game plan.  
  
**Example:** Some kids have Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome-meaning the child may have macroglossia (enlarged tongue) making a difficult intubation.

**Some associated issues that MAY be present you need to be aware of:**  
Chemotherapy issues-cardiac  
Hepatic and coagulopathy  
Difficult airway - Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome  
Associated hypertension? On antihypertensive meds? Captopril is popular.  
Overgrowth syndromes - may require larger airway equipment- then the predicted by age or weight.  
Polycythemia from excessive erythropoietin production from the tumor  
Immunocompromised - from Chemotherapy

Hopefully you won’t have to deal with any of the above, but just be aware of them. They are listed in detail further below.  
  
**Pre-op:**  
**Extensive lab work** - Coags, liver function, CBC and BMP will tell you a lot.  
**T & C with 2 units of PRBCs available.** Because of location of tumor, blood loss can be significant. Make sure the circulating checks for parental/directed donor blood.  
**Platelet Function:** Have it checked pre-operatively. 10% of these patients may have acquired von Willebrand’s disease. Consider cryoprecipitate if needed.

**Airway**: As mentioned above, may be difficult.  
**CXR:** Are the lungs involved? –(metastatic?-rare).  
Is the tumor pushing up against the diaphragm causing a mechanical restriction?

**Operating room temp:** Make sure the room is at least 75 degrees F before you bring the patient back.

Have antihypertensive meds available for your case

**Vascular access device (VAD):** Does your patient have a port-a-cath, PICC line or central venous catheter (CVC). Some patients do who are receiving chemotherapy. You can perform an IV induction with it.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT/Epidural

**Epidural:** Low thoracic level, - T9/10. Epidural is not advised if the patient will go on CPB due to heperanization. Modified RSI for patients with large tumors pressing up against the abdomen.

**Positioning:** Supine  
**A-line:** Usually, because of a potential for hemodynamic instability during tumor handling and associated hypertension.  
  
**Intermittent IVC compression:** Yes, inform the surgeon with large pressure drops. IVC compression may occur while the surgeon mobilizes the kidney.  
**Sudden hypertension:** From the surgeon handling the tumor. Phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine, and Nipride for sudden hypertension.

**CVP:** More rare now. Hopefully the patient already has an IV. Insert other IVs while the patient is asleep.  
**IV Access:** 1-2 large bore. Jaffe says an EJ or upper extremity IV is preferred due to potential obstruction of the IVC during surgery. Avoid lower extremity IVs.

**Blood tubing:** Have readily available  
**Ventilation:** Possible increased PIPs from raised intra-abdominal pressure pushing up against the diaphragm.  
**Duration:** 2-6 hours  
**EBL:** Depends on the surgeon and how extensive the tumor is. Blood loss can be significant. Expect 20-50mL/kg  
**Fluid warmer:** Yes  
**Underbody warming blanket:** Yes-if available **Foley:** Yes, we want 1mL/kg/h of UO. **CPB:** Only with severe venous extension

**Post op Extubation :** Most of the time we extubate. Depends on the extent and duration of the procedure. The patient may need to remain intubated (requiring post op ventilation) when there is excessive blood loss, suspicion of secondary hemorrhage, prolonged procedure and pulmonary atelectasis from abdominal retraction.

**Possible Complications:  
**Hemorrhage  
Hypertension Crisis  
Upstaging from tumor leakage  
Postoperative surgical complications occur in 20% of all resections. 40% when the tumor extends up the IVC to or beyond the hepatic veins.  
Pulmonary Embolus or CVA with intra-cardiac involvement.

**Other Notes and Facts**  
Review Other link “Wilms Tumor Notes and Facts”

Associated hypertension is believed to be from an access release of renin. Ace Inhibitors (Captopril) are effective. So be cautious with beta blockers and adrenergic blockers, they could do more harm. Renin levels fall to normal within hours of resection, however, the BP may take months to normalize. Various combinations of labetalol, hydralazine, diazoxide, diuretics and prazosin have not been effective in the controlling blood pressure preoperatively.

**Chemotherapeutic drugs and possible negative effects**

**Actinomycin D:** can impair the liver and Coags  
**Vincristine:** May cause syndrome of SIADH  
**Doxorubicin: (** An anthracycline), potential for cardiac damage, dysrhythmias and acute cardiomyopathy. Hopefully your patient has had a recent echocardiography to assess myocardial contractility.  
  
**Excising the Tumor  
**Surgeons goal is to excise the large tumor without rupturing the tumor capsule. Tumor spillage immediately up-stages stage I disease to stage II or III, which may require a more aggressive treatment.

**Hypovolemia  
**Remember, this is an open belly procedure. There is third space fluid loss combined with surgical bleeding.

Polycythemia may be present, but very rare.

**Other Anesthetic Concerns** Various combinations of labetalol, hydralazine, diazoxide, diuretics and prazosin have not been effective in the controlling blood pressure preoperatively.

Pulmonary Embolus-with extravascular extension

Coagulopathy from acquired von Willebrand’s disease

Other anomalies and over growth syndromes may be present.

If **intravascular extension is present:** Hepatic congestion, dysfunction and ascites may be present if hepatic venous drainage is impaired.

Pleural effusions may be present.

TEE is the IVC is being manipulated in non-CPB approaches-checking for embolus.

If intracardiac extension is present, partial or full CPB with or without deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) may be utilized.
