### De-airing the Heart

Anytime up the cardiac chambers are opened some air will be introduced.  
  
Air in the right-sided chambers is not so bad, providing there is not serious in the absence of a septal defect.  
  
Air in the left heart is very dangerous because it could lead to a cerebral and/or coronary air embolus.  
  
Cardiac message or aspiration the air with a syringe should be done with the patient in the head‑down position.  
  
It is customary to ventilate the lungs during the de-airing process in order to displace the air that accumulates in the pulmonary veins.  
  
**Causes of Air Emboli:**  
Aortic cannulation.  
Cross clamp placement.  
Cross clamp removal.  
Side-biter clamp.  
Side-biter removal.  
Weaning from bypass.  
Aortic cannula removal.  
  
95% of patients suffer temporary neuro-psychiatric changes consistent with multiple small emboli.
