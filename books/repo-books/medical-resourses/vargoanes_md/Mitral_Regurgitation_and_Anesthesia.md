### Mitral Regurgitation and Anesthesia

**Goal:** Improve left ventricular stroke volume  
  
**Good news:** Most patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) have normal left ventricular function and tolerate all forms of general, neuraxial and regional anesthesia.

**Avoid bradycardia:** Relative tachycardia (goal 80-100 bpm) means less time spent in diastole when the LV overfills and distends the mitral valve annulus.  
**Decrease afterload:** Acute increase in afterload will worsen MR and should be treated promptly.  
**Increase preload:** Adequate volume is necessary to maintain LVEDP and stroke volume.  
**Maintain normal or increased contractility:** The dilated LV may require inotropic support to promote forward ejection.  
**  
Perioperative anesthesia  
**Avoid hypoxia, hypercarbia, acidosis and lung hyper-expansion.  
  
**Premedication:** Reduce anxiety but do not over-sedate.  
  
**DO NOT Over-Premedicate:** Caution with hypercarbia and acidosis can worsen pulmonary hypertension.  
Anxiety may increase SVR.  
  
**Monitoring:** For severe MR, consider arterial line and TEE.  
  
**Induction:** Etomidate or propofol  
Maintain or decrease SVR because any INCREASE in SVR will decrease LV output into the aorta and increase the severity of MR.  
A prolonged abnormal decrease in SVR should also be avoided.  
  
**Avoid Ketamine:** It may stimulate the sympathetic nervous system and enhance left ventricular emptying, causing an increase in prolapse and regurgitation.  
  
**Muscle relaxation:** No contraindication  
Pancuronium would be optimal, but rarely stocked anymore.  
  
**Anesthesia maintenance  
**Maintain adequate or deep anesthesia to attenuate undesirable increases in SVR due to surgical stimulation.  
Volatile anesthetics combined with nitrous oxide and/or opioids are useful in attenuating sympathetic nervous system activity and decreasing SVR.  
  
**Avoid tachycardia:** because adverse effects of decreased diastolic time on LVEDV, which in turn decreases cardiac output. Keep HR 80-100 bpm.  
  
**Decreased SVR and adequate preload  
**Adequate hydration is important prior to an anticipated decrease in SVR.  
Volume administration may offset any changes in left ventricular volume that could affect the degree of prolapse and regurgitation.  
  
**Ventricular dysrhythmias in the sitting position  
**During anesthesia ventricular dysrhythmias in the head-up or sitting position have been reported.  
Lidocaine and beta-blockers can be utilized for treatment.  
It is presumed this position increases the left ventricular emptying and exacerbates MVP.  
  
**Treatment for Hypotension**  
Ephedrine is more appropriate for treating hypotension.  
Neosynephrine (low dose): Larger doses may exacerbate MR by increasing SVR and slowing heart rate.  
  
**Muscle relaxant reversal  
**Consider sugammadex since it does not cause bradycardia.  
  
**Emergence  
**Consider a deep extubation when not contraindicated.**  
  
More Notes**  
Minimize drug induced myocardial depression and reduce regurgitation fraction.  
  
Must determine if the patient has mild symptomatic chronic MR or acute regurgitation imposed on chronic MR (common with MVR procedures).  
Acute regurgitation usually occurs after an MI.  
  
Controlled hypotension would be unwise because the change in systemic vascular resistance would enhance the degree of MVP.  
  
Patients with severe MVP may not tolerate the dose-dependent myocardial depression of volatile anesthetics.
