### Buttock Implants (gluteal augmentation)

Buttock augmentation involves the surgical insertion of silicone implants into a patient’s buttocks.  
Butt implants allow for buttock augmentation in patients with little or no fat deposits available as donor sites.  
  
**Candidates for Gluteal Implant  
**Very thin patients with virtually no excess fatty deposits anywhere on the body and minimal gluteal sagging, wishing to increase the projection and volume of the buttocks.  
  
**Procedure**  
Shaped silicone implants are placed through an incision made either where the margin of the gluteal area meets the back of the thigh or in the natal cleft (where scars are not as noticeable). The surgeon then creates a pocket large enough to place the silicone gluteal implants. For both male and female patients, gluteal implants can be placed superficial or deep to the muscle. Once placed, the surgeon confirms that appearance is symmetrical and natural. The incisions are closed, and a compression garment is applied.  
  
The standard sized gluteal implants range from 200ml to 400ml per side. While this may seem small when compared to the average amount of fat injected per side during a “Brazilian butt lift” (i.e. 400ml to 600ml per side), because of its solid silicone shape, a gluteal implant provides more gluteal projection (i.e. increase in an anterior to posterior, or front to back dimension) than the same amount of injected fat.  
  
**Anesthesia:** General/ETT. LMA is rarely appropriate due to duration of procedure and prone position.  
**Regional:** Not indicated.  
**Duration:** 2-3 hours.  
**Position:** Prone.  
**EBL:** 25-50 ml.  
  
**Possible Complications:  
**Infection.  
Bleeding.  
Nerve and/or muscle damage.  
Implant displacement resulting in asymmetry.  
Infection.  
Movement of the implant.  
Capsular contracture.  
Fluid collection.  
  
There are no long-term studies evaluating the safety of this procedure.
