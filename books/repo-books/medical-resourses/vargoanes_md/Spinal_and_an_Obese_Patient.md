### Spinal and an Obese Patient

_A regular spinal need is 3.5 inches long.  
A 25g 5 inch Quinke spinal needed may be utilized when a 3.5 inch needle is not long enough._Obesity on the mid backside may require the 5 inch spinal needle.  
  
You cannot rely on a patient’s weight and assume you will need a longer spinal needle.  
  
A patient may have back flabs of adipose tissue, but a thin midline.  
  
Regardless of the patient’s weight, we usually start with the 3.5 spinal needle.  
Make sure you always have a 5 inch spinal needle available.
