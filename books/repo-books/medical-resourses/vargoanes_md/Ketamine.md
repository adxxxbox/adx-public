# Ketamine

**Ketamine (Ketalar)**  
**Class:** Phencyclidine derivative.  
Has potent amnestic and analgesic properties.  
Intraoperative ketamine reduced 48 hour morphine consumption by 52% with chronic pain patients.  
The only general anesthetic agent we use (IV) that does not cause hypotension and apnea (severe respiratory depression).  
**Doses**  
**Induction Dose:** 1-2mg/kg IV 6-13mg/kg IM **Peds IM:** 6-13mg/kg  
**Peds IV:** 1-2mg/kg  
**Analgesia:** 0.2-0.5mg/kg  
**Adjuncts to opioid analgesia** 5-10mg per dose.  
**Chronic Pain Patients to reduce perioperative opiates:**  
0.5mg/kg with induction followed with 10mcg/kg/min drip or  
10mg single doses/hr.  
**Trauma TIVA:** 200mg and 10mg Versed.  
**Drip:** 1-2mg/kg/hr  
**Adjunct to Propofol Drip:** 0.1-0.3mg/kg/hr.  
**Failed C-section:** 10mg IV per dose as needed.  
**Post op analgesia for Peds Cardiac Surgery:**1-2mg/kg/hr.  
**Onset:** 30secs  
**Peak:** 3-5 minutes  
**Duration:** 8-15 minutes  
**Amnesia:** Yes  
**Increases ICP/IOP and CMRO2:** Yes  
It produces "dissociative anesthesia." A disassociation between the thalamocortical and limbic system is verified via EEG.  
Dissociative anesthesia means it resembles a catalyptic or dissociative to which the eyes remain open with a slow nystagmic gaze. The patient appears awake, but not communicative.  
The patient may have hypertonous, and purposeful movement skeletal muscle movements that are often independently of surgical stimulation.  
**MOA:** Binds noncompetitively to N-methyl-D-aspertate (NMDA).  
**Also Exerts Effects On:**  
Opioid Receptors  
Muscarinic Receptors  
GABA Receptors (weak stimulation)  
Voltage - Sensitive Sodium Channels  
L-type Calcium Channels  
**About N-methyl-D-aspertate (NMDA) Receptor**  
Member of the Glutamate Receptor family .  
Glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and spinal cord, exerts its postsynaptic effects via a diverse set of membrane receptors.  
Ketamine inhibits activation of NMDA receptors by Glutamate, decreases presynaptic release of glutamate, and potentiates the release of GABA.  
Always give Robinul and Versed with Ketamine.  
Versed for decreasing emergence delirium if not contraindicated.  
Robinul to decrease the thick and tenacious secretions Ketamine induces. Copious secretions may cause laryngospasms. And increase in cough.  
Today, ketamine mostly used in small doses as an analgesic, especially with chronic pain patients.  
A small dose (50mg) during the case offers great post-op analgesia (like Toradol).  
Stimulates SNS, good for hypovolemic, trauma patients, and preserves airway reflexes.  
Avoid with patients who have compromised cardiac function and increased airway secretions.  
It's water soluble, Propofol and Etomidate are not.  
**Structure Activity Relationship of Ketamine**  
Structurally resembles phencyclidine  
Has 2 isomers. The Racemic form is the most popular.  
**Opioid Receptors**  
Ketamine interacts with mu, delta and kappa opioid receptors.  
Some literature suggests that ketamine is an agonist to mu and kappa receptors.  
Ketamine interacts with sigma receptors (not true opioid receptors) but the interaction is weak.  
**Monoaminergic Receptors**  
The antinociceptive action of ketamine may involve descending inhibitory monoaminergic pain pathways.  
**Muscarinic Receptors**  
Ketamine produces anticholinergic effects (emergence delirium, bronchodilitation and sympathomimetic actions). It is also not ruled out of having agonist effects.  
**Sodium Channels**  
Ketamine is consistent with local anesthetic-like properties and shares the same binding sites as local anesthetics.  
**Pharmokinetics of Ketamine**  
Rapid onset, short duration and high lipid solubility  
pH 7.5  
Peak plasma concentration IV is 1 minute, 5 minutes IM.  
Peak concentration to the brain 4-5 minutes.  
Not highly protein bound, distribution to other tissues.  
5-10 times more lipid soluble than Thiopental.  
Rapid transfer across the blood brain barrier.  
Increases cerebral blood flow.  
High hepatic clearance.  
Large Vd (3 liters/kg)  
Elimination half - time 2 to 3 hours  
**Metabolism of Ketamine**  
Hepatic microsomal enzymes cytochrome P-450 forming Norketamine.  
Metabolite Norketamine is 1/5 to 1/3 as potent as Ketamine.  
**Clinical Uses of Ketamine**  
Intense analgesia at subanesthetic doses.  
Induction agent at higher doses.  
An antisialagogue (Robinul) is recommended prior to administration to decrease coughing and possible laryngospasm due to ketamine induced salivation.  
Atropine and Scopolamine are not recommended because they easily cross the blood brain barrier and could contribute to emergence delirium.  
**Analgesia**  
0.2-0.5mg/kg for analgesia  
Small doses are also useful adjuncts to opioid analgesia **Somatosensory Evoked Potentials**  
Ketamine increases the cortical amplitude of somatosensory evoke potentials.  
**Cardiovascular Effects of Ketamine**  
A direct negative cardiac inotropic, but this is overshadowed by central sympathetic stimulation.  
**Hemodynamic Effects of Ketamine**  
**Increases:**  
SAB and PAB  
HR and CO  
MVO2  
Ketamine has been shown to decrease the need for inotropic support with septic patients.  
**Ventilation and Airway**  
Does not produce significant depression of ventilation.  
Decreases RR for only around the first 2-3 minutes.  
Response to CO2 is maintained.  
Upper airway reflexes remain intact.  
Mucus gland secretions are increased.  
Bronchodilator.  
Subanesthetic doses have been used to treat bronchospasms.  
**Emergence Delirium and Ketamine**  
With emergence-visual, auditory, proprioceptive, and confusing illusions which may progress to delirium.  
Cortical blindness may be transient.  
Dreams and hallucinations can occur up to 24 hours.  
Frequent morbid and colorful dreams-usually disappears within a few hours.  
Occurs 5-30%  
**Factors That Increase Emergence Delirium**  
\>15 years  
Female  
\>2mg/kg  
Hx of personality problems  
Emergence delirium occurs less frequently with repeated use.  
**Prevention of Emergence Delirium**  
Versed is more effective than Valium  
Give 5 minutes before induction  
Thiopental and inhaled anesthetics may decrease it  
Atropine or Droperidol pre-op may increase it
