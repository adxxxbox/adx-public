### Aspirin (ASA) - Acetylsalicylic Acid

**Brand names:** Ascriptin, Aspir 81, Aspir-Low, Bayer Childrens Aspirin, Bufferin Low Dose, Durlaza, Ecotrin, Ecpirin, Fasprin, Halfprin, Miniprin.  
  
Considered an Antiplatelet medication  
**COX Inhibitor**  
**Class:** Salicylate  
Aspirin has antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and platelet inhibiting effects.  
  
**Indications:**  
To decrease the risks of strokes and MI in selected patients.  
Aspirin is recommended for men age 45 to 79 years when the potential benefit due to a reduction in myocardial infarctions outweighs the potential harm due to an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage.  
Aspirin is recommended for women age 55 to 79 years when the potential benefit of a reduction in ischemic strokes outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage.  
  
**Onset/Duration:** ASA has an onset of action of 15-30 minutes, even at low doses of 81 mg. When a patient is at a therapeutic level of ASA, the effects can last for 4-7 days.  
Low-dose, long-term aspirin is an **irreversible platelet inhibitor.**  
  
**Mechanism of Action:** Irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenases (COXs), the enzymes that convert arachidonic acid to a variety of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. Blocking formation of thromboxane A 2 in **platelets,** produces an **inhibitory** effect on **platelet** aggregation.  
  
**Irreversible = life span of platelets**  
Because aspirin is an irreversible inhibitor of COX-1, platelets are affected for their lifetime  
while in the circulation and thus the platelet inhibitory effects of the drug diminish only with the synthesis of new platelets, taking roughly 7-10 days.  
  
**Platelet Life-span:** about 8-10 days. An average of 1011 platelets are produced daily in a healthy adult.  
  
COX-1 inhibition → blocks the release of thromboxane A2 (TXA2). The result of this is a “slippery” platelet that cannot aggregate for the life-span of the platelet; red blood cells do not stick to affected platelets.  
  
Aspirin acts differently from other NSAIDS, which are reversible inhibitors.  
  
**Metabolism:** Hepatic  
**Excretion:** Urine (80%–100%), sweat, saliva and feces  
**Elimination T1/2:** 20 min (may reach 15– 30 hours when higher doses are ingested).  
  
**Possible side effects:**  
GI irritation and bleeding, respiratory, and renal effects.  
Toxic doses can lead to ototoxicity and potentially fatal metabolic acidosis  
As described in platelet plugging, release of thromboxane A2 from an activated platelet promotes the activation of nearby platelets thus facilitating platelet aggregation.  
  
**Coagulation and monitoring  
****ASA and prolonged bleeding time:**  
If patient is otherwise normal, aspirin usually prolongs the bleeding time by 1.5 - 2 minutes.  
ASA can increase bleeding time > 30 minutes in patients with undiagnosed asymptomatic heterozygous von Willebrand disease.  
  
Coagulation is not affected: consequently, while bleeding time is increased due to reduced platelet function, the coagulation parameters of PT/PTT remain unchanged.  
  
**Lab Monitoring:** ASA is normally not monitored.**  
Optional Lab Monitoring Test consists of Platelet function tests.**  
Arachidonic acid-based tests (Verify Now Aspirin Test).  
Multiplate.  
Platelet function assay (PFA).  
PRP aggregation.  
  
**Noncardiac patients and aspirin before surgery**  
It has been standard practice to stop aspirin 5-10 days before elective surgery or invasive procedures for fear of excessive bleeding, OTHER THAN for patients who have recently had coronary artery stents placed.

**Surgery and ASA**  
Many surgical patients do not realize they have been taking aspirin in one form or another.  
As many as 50% of patients undergoing unexpected surgery have a history of recent aspirin ingestion.  
  
**ASA and prolonged bleeding time:**  
If patient is otherwise normal, aspirin usually prolongs the bleeding time by 1.5 - 2 minutes.  
  
ASA can increase bleeding time > 30 minutes in patients with undiagnosed asymptomatic heterozygous von Willebrand disease.  
  
It has been standard practice to stop aspirin 5-10 days before elective surgery or invasive procedures for fear of excessive bleeding, OTHER THAN for patients who have recently had coronary artery stents placed.

More Notes  
Platelet Function Assay (PFA)  
**The PFA test is a new laboratory screening test of platelet function that measures both platelet adhesion and aggregation (primary hemostasis).  
  
A “Bleeding Time Test” cannot be used to reliably identify patients who may have recently ingested aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents or those who have a platelet defect attributable to these drugs.  
  
Aspirin inhibits the platelet COX (cyclooxygenase) enzyme which is responsible for  
the production of prostaglandin and thromboxane.  
  
**Thromboxane** is a potent platelet pro-coagulant.  
Aspirin should be withheld for 7-10 days prior to any surgery where bleeding could be catastrophic.  
Both COX-1 and COX-2 convert arachidonic acid to prostaglandin, resulting in pain and inflammation.  
  
**There are at least two different cyclooxygenase.** **isozymes:**  
**COX-1** (PTGS1) (COX-1) produces prostaglandins that activate platelets and protect the stomach and intestinal lining.  
**COX-2** (PTGS2). Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is for inflammation.  
  
True selective COX-2 inhibitors have no effect on gastric mucosal prostaglandin synthesis, to cause no acute injury, and no chronic ulceration.  
  
Unlike older NSAIDs that block both COX-1 and COX-2, the newer COX-2 inhibitors selectively block only the COX-2 enzyme.  
Since COX-2 inhibitors do not block COX-1 (which primarily produces prostaglandins that protect the stomach and promote blood clotting) they do not cause ulcers or increase the risk of bleeding as much as the older NSAIDs.  
  
Nevertheless, COX-2 inhibitors are as effective as the older NSAIDs for treating inflammation, pain and fever.  
  
Aspirin-modified COX-2 produces lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory.  
  
Newer NSAID drugs called COX-2 selective inhibitors have been developed that inhibit only COX-2, with the hope for reduction of gastrointestinal side-effects.  
  
Several COX-2 selective inhibitors (e.g Vioxx) have subsequently been withdrawn after evidence emerged that COX-2 inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack.  
  
Thromboxane A2 is a potent vasoconstrictor and facilitates secondary platelet aggregation and release reactions. An adequate, although potentially fragile, clot may form.  
  
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended daily aspirin therapy for patients aged 50 to 59 years, who are not at increased bleeding risk, and who have an increased risk of heart attack or stroke of 10 percent or greater over the next 10 years. This is also recommended for patients aged 60 to 69 who, are not at increased bleeding risk, and who have a high risk of heart attack or stroke of 10 percent or greater over the next 10 years.
