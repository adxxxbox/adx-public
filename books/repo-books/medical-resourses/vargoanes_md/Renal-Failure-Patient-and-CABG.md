### Renal Failure Patient and CABG

Avoid using drugs that require renal metabolism or excretion. Avoid using pancuronuim and to a lesser extent vecuronium and rocuronium. Reduced doses of these relaxants may be used.  
  
Patients with renal failure are often hemodynamically labile.  
  
**Pre-op comorbidities include:**  
Volume depletion resulting from dialysis.  
Hyperkalemia.  
Acidosis.  
Poorly controlled hypertension.  
Anemia and hemodynamic instability.  
  
Many of these patients receive recombinant erythropoietin to control their anemia.  
  
Determine time of last dialysis. If dialysis is recent, volume depletion and difficult vascular access is more likely. IV access is difficult in any case. The AV fistula is vulnerable to damage during vascular access procedures; care should be exercised to prevent such damage.  
  
Many of these patients are dialyzed a day before surgery.  
  
Central venous line access should be contralateral to the AV access side.  
  
**Hyperkalemia**  
Hyperkalemia may be present, and may be tolerated well up to 6 mEq/l. Cardioplegic solution contains potassium and may exacerbate hyperkalemia. Perfusionists are normally responsible for regulation of potassium levels during bypass. T-wave changes occurring as a result of hyperkalemia may be treated by administration of calcium chloride.  
  
**Blood Transfusions**  
Blood transfusion may complicate tissue matching should kidney transplant be necessary later in life. Notwithstanding this, necessary and indicated transfusion is done. Platelets and cryoprecipitate are often given. Cryoprecipitate contains fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, factor VIII, factor XIII and fibronectin and is supplied in pooled concentrates of 6 units.  
  
**DDAVP (Arginine Vasopressin)**  
DDAVP may be indicated because of the risk of perioperative bleeding due to impaired platelet function. DDAVP stimulates the release of von Willebrand factor from the vascular endothelium.  
  
The arms must be positioned with care to avoid pressure on the AV fistula or graft. Bedside dialysis is usually done the day following surgery.
