Mandibular (lower jaw) Osteotomy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Mandibular (lower jaw) Osteotomy

This can be for a mandibular fracture, facial trauma, OSA or deformity of the mandible.  
**Osteotomy**: The sawing or cutting of a bone. Most commonly done at the back corner of the jaw in the ramus area, so the mandible can be slid forward or backwards to align the jaw and teeth.

**Pre-op**: Airway assessment.  
Don’t overreact and assume a fiberoptic intubation will be required for a mandibular fracture. If there is a fracture, the pre-op patient may appear to have a limited mouth opening due to their pain. However, once the patient is asleep, the fractured mandible usually becomes much easier to manipulate and intubate. You can always have the glide scope as back up.

**Anesthetic**:  
General/muscle relaxation with nasal intubation.  
Don’t forget to have Magill forceps and a vasocontricting nasal spray.  
**Position:** Supine, HOB up 15-30 degrees (this increases venous drainage and decreases swelling). Bed will be rotated 90-180 degrees depending on the surgeon’s preference.

Arms in, but do not need to be tightly tucked.  
**Eyes**: Most maxillofacial surgeons prefer eye ointment and tegaderm covering both lids.

**Duration**: 2-5 hours, depending on procedure and the surgeon.

**Throat pack**: Yes. The surgeon should tell you when he/she inserts and removes it. You should document the times.

**Empty the stomach at the end of case**: YES. Have an NG tube available to give to the surgeon so he can pass it down orally to empty the stomach after the packing is out. The stomach should be emptied and decompressed before the jaw is wired shut.

**Jaw wired shut (maxillomandibular fixation)**: YES, most of the time there will be a wire fixation but ask the surgeon. It will determine your anesthetic and wake up plans.  
Today, the surgeons tend to utilize rubber bands instead of wires to attach the arch bars. Either way, wire cutters or scissors are to be kept with the patient at all times in case an airway emergency occurs.

**EBL:** <150 mLs

**Emergence**: Awake extubation, smooth emergence. Give antiemetics. Do everything possible to prevent PONV. Remember, the jaw is wired or banded shut.

**BP maintenance**: Systolic around 100 mmHg (MAP 60-70 mmHg) is usually the goal as long as the pressure is kept within 20% of the baseline.  
The jaw and face are vascular, so try and prevent bleeding.  
Epinephrine Injections by surgeon: Yes, 1:200,000 Epinephrine for hemostasis is common before incision. So don’t panic when the BP and HR suddenly jumps.  
Suction Catheter with emergence: Yes. The flexible catheter is easier to suction out the back of the throat by inserting it around behind the molars while the jaw is banded shut. There is a limited access when using a yankauer.

**Drugs to consider**:  
Robinul 0.2mg: give early in the case.  
Decadron 4-12mg  
Zofran 4mg  
Ofirmev (Tylenol) drip 1,000mg or 15 mg/kg. Give over 15 minutes.  
Toradol 30mg, if not contraindicated.  
IV Lidocaine or Propofol to prevent bucking at the end of the case.

**Remember**: Toradol and Tylenol decrease narcotic requirements. We all know narcotics can cause PONV.
