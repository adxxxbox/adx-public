### Factor X Deficiency

Inherited factor X deficiency is autosomal recessive, but also may be acquired later in life.  
**Incidence:** 1per 500,000-1,000,000 population worldwide.  
  
**Heterozygotes:** Usually asymptomatic; exhibiting just a mild bleeding tendency.  
**Homozygous:** May experience hemorrhagic symptoms, including easy bruising, hematuria, soft-tissue hemorrhages, hemarthroses, recurrent epistaxis, and menorrhagia.  
Females and males can equally be affected.  
  
Factor X is vitamin K-dependent; serves as the first enzyme in the common pathway of thrombus formation.  
Factor X deficiency is a bleeding disorder that can be inherited or acquired. This disorder is one of the world's most rare factor deficiencies.  
**  
Possible causes of Acquired Factor X deficiency:**  
Lack of vitamin K.  
Amyloidosis.  
Severe liver disease.  
Vitamin K antagonists e.g. warfarin.  
  
Women with factor X deficiency may first be diagnosed when they have very heavy menstrual bleeding and bleeding after childbirth. The condition may be first noticed in newborn boys if they have bleeding that lasts longer than normal after circumcision.  
  
**Exams and Tests**  
Factor X assay (low activity confirms).  
Normal Thrombin Time.  
Prolonged Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT).  
Prolonged Prothrombin Time (PT).  
  
**Treatment Options:  
**In October 2015, the U.S. FDA approved: **Coagadex®,** (coagulation factor X, human).  
Coagadex®, a plasma derived concentrate, is indicated for individuals (aged 12 and older) with hereditary Factor X deficiency for on-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes, and for the perioperative management of bleeding in patients with mild hereditary Factor X deficiency.  
  
**Other prior Product  
**FPP or plasma.  
Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs): increased risk of thrombosis.  
Factor X concentrate.  
**Antifibrinolytic agents:** aminocaproic acid (Amicar) or tranexamic acid, or topical therapies, such as nosebleed powders or fibrin glue, may relieve bleeding symptoms in patients with mild symptoms.  
  
**Treatment of factor X deficiency (not acquired)**  
Restoring circulating factor X levels to 10-40% of normal is usually adequate.  
Coagadex®.  
Factor X Concentrate.  
FFP.  
Tranexamic Acid.  
  
**Treatment of factor X deficiency (acquired)**  
Treatment of the underlying cause.  
Factor X Concentrate.  
Fresh Frozen Plasma.  
Prothrombin Complex Concentrates (PCCs).  
  
**More Notes:**  
In the 1950s, two groups first identified factor X and the deficiency.  
Telfer and colleagues reported a bleeding tendency in a 22-year-old woman named Prower in 1956.  
Hougie and colleagues described abnormal coagulation profiles in a 36-year-old man named Stuart in 1957.  
The factor involved was designated Stuart-Prower factor. This factor became known as factor X.
