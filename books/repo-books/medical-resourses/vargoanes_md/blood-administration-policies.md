# Blood Administration Policies

**Consent**  
The MD or LIP is responsible for obtaining and documenting informed consent for blood product administration except when the need for a transfusion is determined to be an emergency.  
If an emergency, MD must document the nature of the emergency in the patient's chart.  
**Type & Cross**  
After the blood is drawn a blood bracelet is placed on the patient's wrist by the person drawing the blood.  
It contains patient's name, medical record number, armband number, date and initials of the person collecting the blood.  
Unless it's a life or death situation, NEVER transfuse blood to a patient if the blood bracelet is not attached to the patient's arm.  
**Verification of Consent**  
The RN is responsible for verification of informed consent prior to administration of blood/blood products using the Blood Consent Verification Form.  
If consent for blood/blood products has been included in the surgical consent, the RN completes the Informed Consent Verification form as well as the Blood Consent Verification Form.  
**Refusal**  
The patient always has the right to refuse blood/blood products. The RN uses the Blood Consent Verification Form to document the patient refusal.  
**Administration**  
Take Vital signs are taken before administering blood. If the temp is >100 degrees F, notify the physician.  
Once the blood is infusing, the physician should be notified for any two degree increase above the baseline temperature.  
Keep that slip attached to the blood bag during transfusion.  
It is not removed until the transfusion is complete.  
All blood must be infused using a blood administration set. The blood set/filter may only be used up to a maximum of four hours.  
**Administration Time Frame**  
Whole blood and PRBCs should be routinely infused over 1-2 hours but not more than 4 hours.  
American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) states "4 hours as the maximum duration for an infusion."  
**NICU/Nursery**  
We normally pulls the blood into a syringe through a blood filter and administers via a syringe pump.  
**General Information**  
Blood shall be administered (started) by a physician or a registered nurse only.  
Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (normal saline) is the only solution suitable for use with the transfusion of blood products.  
Blood products are never to be infused in a line with other medications already infusing i.e. Morphine IV PCA cannot be infused with blood.  
Medications are never added to blood products.  
**Documentation**  
The Transfusion Record is used to document blood administration. Documentation includes:  
Date and time the blood was started.  
For vitals: Many chart "SAR" (See Anesthesia Record)  
Amount transfused: You should not chart "ALL."  
Time completed  
Who discontinued the blood  
**Adverse Reactions**  
Should a reaction occur: STOP the transfusion.  
Keep the line open with saline.  
Follow directions on back of Transfusion Record.
