Branchial (third or fourth) Pouch Cysts and Sinus Dissection   

## Branchial (third or fourth) Pouch Cysts and Sinus Dissection

Third or fourth branchial pouch anomalies are rare and usually present as lateral neck masses, abscesses, or acute thyroiditis.

The third and fourth branchial pouches are clinically similar because they both originate from the pyriform sinus (lateral to the glottis) and may exit the neck, appearing as rare current neck or thyroid abscesses.

(**Pyriform Sinus** is on either side of the laryngeal orifice and easily viewed with a direct laryngoscopy)

**Treatment for fourth branchial anomalies:**  
Complete surgical excision because of the risk of infection and life-threatening abscesses.

Because of the high incidence of secondary infection of these anomalies, early excision is recommended.

These anomalies typically present as recurrent neck or thyroid abscesses. When the patient drinks fluid, some of the fluid may actually emerge from the neck is indicative of this kind of sinus tract.

To assess for a fistula, the surgeon may perform a direct or flexible laryngoscopy to visualize the pyriform sinus apex, seeing a small hole in the pyriform sinus fossa next to the glottis. A cholangiocath can be used to cannulate the tract prior to dissection.

**Pre-operative discussion with the surgeon:**  
You should find out from the surgeon if he/she prefers an ETT or LMA.

Some surgeons may start with an endoscopy which enables them to cannulate the tract from the pyriform sinus with a cholangiocath and advance it to facilitate localization of the tract during resection.

**Indications for Treatment**  
Infection  
Mass effect (dysphagia, dyspnea, pain)  
Cosmetic  

**Treatment:** Complete surgical excision.

**Age Range:** Neonate – Adult

**Anesthetic:**  
General/ETT or LMA.  
  
**Airway:**  
The neck may be swollen and inflamed from infection, but usually not enough to impede the airway. Always assess thoroughly.  
  
**Muscle Relaxation:**  
Check with the surgeon to see if he/she plans on using a neuro stimulator to clearly identify the facial or other nerves.  
  
**Position:**  
Supine, with arms to the side. Shoulder roll with donut beneath the cranium so that the neck is extended. Head of bed is raised slightly to decrease venous blood pressure in the head and neck. The chin is turned away from the operative side.  
  
**A-line:** Not needed  
**IV Access:** One good flowing IV that’s age appropriate. Large bore not required.  
Use NS or LR and have albumin ready.

**Hydration: 4:2:1** **(below is just a common reference)**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg  
  

**Age Range:** Neonate – Adult  
  
**Contraindications:**  
Acute infection (treat prior to excision)  
Medical contraindication to elective surgery.  

**More Notes**  
**A third and fourth Branchial Pouch Cysts** can be some extensive from their anatomical location.

**Derivatives of the fourth pouch include:**  
Laryngeal cartilages.  
Laryngeal and pharyngeal constrictor muscles.  
Superior laryngeal nerve.  
Left thoracic aorta.  
Right proximal subclavian artery.  
May effect the superior parathyroid glands and thyroid gland.

**Methods of Diagnosis to identify location and extent of pyriform sinus anomalies:**  
Barium esophagogram.  
CT scan.  
MRI

**Surgical Approach:**  
Depending on the anomaly, the surgical approach may begin with exposure of the thyroid ala and carotid sheath to begin in an area free of post-inflammatory fibrosis.  
Sometimes the surgeon will remove a portion of the thyroid gland.

Fourth branchial arch anomalies are rare and may present in many different ways.

< 100 cases have been reported and they account for 1–4% of all branchial anomalies.

Recently, use of sclerotherapy with OK-432 has been expanded to treat branchial cleft cysts
