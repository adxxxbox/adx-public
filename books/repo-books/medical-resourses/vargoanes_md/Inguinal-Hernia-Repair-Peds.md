### Inguinal Hernia Repair (Laparoscopic or Open)

_Edited by John Martin Kramer CRNA, Novant Health, Charlotte, NC._

A hernia is a protrusion of normal cavity contents through the fascia and muscular layers designed to contain them.

**Incidence/Risk Factors**

**Inguinal Hernias**  
9x more common in boys  
60% on the right  
25% on the left  
15% bilateral  
3-5% of full-term infants have an inguinal hernia  
5-30% of premature infants have an inguinal hernia

**Indirect inguinal hernia (most common in Peds)**  
The visceral contents herniate through the inguinal canal. The inguinal canal is formed by the aponeurosis of the inguinal canal anteriorly and the transversus abdominus muscle and transversalis fascia posteriorly

**Laparoscopic:** As with any inguinal hernia. The surgeon may insert a trocar into the abdomen and insufflation to view the opposite internal inguinal ring for a contralateral inguinal hernia. You may be asked to place the bed in Trendelenburg for bowel displacement optimizing the view.

The most frequent general procedure performed by pediatric surgeons.

Most frequently performed within the first two years of life. Premature infants are more prone to inguinal hernias

More frequent in males than females.

Frequency: Right sided-60%

Left sided 30% Bilateral 10%

**  
Other risk factors associated with inguinal hernias:  
**Prematurity  
Chronic respiratory illness  
Excess intraperitoneal fluid  
VP shunts  
Ascites Peritoneal dialysis

**Anesthesia:** General/ETT or LMA with mask induction, unless incarcerated, then RSI.

**Caudal Block:** Common for infants not yet walking. However, a toddler able to walk does not rule out a caudal block. Caudal anesthesia can decrease inhalational anesthetic and either avoid/reduce narcotics.

**Inguinal Block (Ilioinguinal and iliohypgastric nerves):** Is used for postoperative pain in conjunction with general anesthesia. Reported to be as effective as caudal anesthesia.

**Spinal anesthesia:** An option for ex-preterm infants at risk for post-operative apnea.

**Ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric block-** Infants and neonates have a HIGH failure rate with this block. This block is rare. LMA can be used if the hernia is not incarcerated.

**Note:** When using an LMA without a caudal block, you should keep the patient deep. When the spermatic cord is being manipulated, a laryngospasm or bradycardia can occur if your patient is anesthetically light.

**Narcotics:** Minimal to none are required when a caudal block is added.

**Position:** Supine. Temporarily moved to lateral position after the airway is secured for a caudal block. Infant may be repositioned away from you towards the foot of the bed. Protect the airway and make sure you have sufficient anesthesia circuit tubing length.

**IV Access** : 24g or 22g is adequate.

**Hydration: 4:2:1 (below is just a common reference)  
**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**Arterial Line:** Not needed

**Duration:** 30-60 minutes

**EBL:** Minimal

**Synthetic Patch-** not inserted with infants.

**Possible Complications:**

Damage to vas deferens and spermatic cord in males. Damage to the Genitofemoral nerve.

Re-occurrence of hernia (uncommon less than 1%)

Chronic pain Hydrocele Wound infection

**More Notes**

A hernia is a protrusion of normal cavity contents through the fascia and muscular layers designed to contain them.

**Indirect inguinal hernia**  
The visceral contents herniate through the inguinal canal. The inguinal canal is formed by the aponeurosis of the inguinal canal anteriorly and the transversus abdominus muscle and transversalis fascia posteriorly.

**Direct inguinal hernia (uncommon in children)**  
The visceral contents protrude through a weakness in the abdominal wall (typically Hesselbach’s triangle, bounded by the inferior epigastric vessles, the inguinal ligament, and the rectus sheath) and exit through the superficial inguinal ring.

During the 3rd month of gestation, the testis begins its descent from a retroperitoneal location, following the course of the gubernaculum through the inguinal canal. An extension of the peritoneum called the processus vaginalis in males and the canal of Nuck in females is the remnant of this descent. It is obliterated (closed) in 95-98% of term infants.  
If it does not close but remains patent, the development of a congenital hernia may develop.

For children with a unilateral hernia, there is still up to a 60% chance of a patent contralateral processus vaginalis. This leaves the patient at risk for developing another hernia on the opposing side. This is why many surgeons will explore the contralateral side. The contralateral side can be explored laparoscopically without making another incision.

The risk of exploring the contralateral side is damaging the contralateral vas deferens and spermatic cord.

**Inguinal hernia surgery in girls  
**In girls, a sliding hernia may contain the ovary or a portion of the fallopian tube. These structures should be carefully dissected from the internal wall of the sac before suture ligation.

**Inguinal hernia surgery and testicular or vas anomalies**

An undescended testis discovered during herniorrhaphy should be repaired, even if the infant is younger than 1 year. This repair avoids the complications of incarceration, strangulation, and testicular infarction, while increasing potential fertility.

**Increased incidence with:**  
Prematurity  
Respiratory disease causes increased abdominal pressure  
family history  
Abdominal wall defects  
Exstrophy of the bladder or cloaca  
GU anomalies  
Undescended testes  
Intersex disorders  
Liver disease with ascites  
Peritoneal dialysis  
V-P shunts  
Cystic fibrosis  
Disorders of connective tissue formation
