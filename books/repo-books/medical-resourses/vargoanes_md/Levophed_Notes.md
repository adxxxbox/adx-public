### (Levophed) Norepinephrine Pharmacology and Notes

**Indications:** Hypotension not responding to other pressors. Neurogenic shock.  
  
**Mechanism of Action:** Potent alpha-adrenergic agonist and beta-1 agonist (alpha>beta).  
More potent than phenylephrine.  
  
**Effect:** Increases SVR by vasoconstricting arteries and veins.  
However, it decreases blood flow to all organs except heart and brain, as is typical of a catecholamine. Can cause worsening metabolic acidosis due to ischemia. Can decrease cardiac output. Increases myocardial oxygen demand and causes myocardial ischemia. Thus invasive monitoring of BP is important. Norepinephrine can be deactivated by alkaline solutions.  
  
**Routes:** Intravenous infusion only.  
  
**Contraindications:** Hypotension due to hypovolemia.  
  
**Complications:** Tachyarrhythmias, angina, tissue necrosis and/or sloughing with extravasation (infiltration).  
Increases myocardial oxygen demand, causes myocardial ischemia.  
Infiltration of a peripheral IV can cause tissue necrosis. Phentolamine infiltration minimizes sloughing.
