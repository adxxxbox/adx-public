### Epidural Top Off - Doses

**(Perineal) Dose - S2-S4**  
_A sitting patient will have more local anesthetic delivered to the lower lumbar and sacral dermatomes._  
  
**Top Off:  
**_There are a variety of Top Off doses among anesthesia providers.  
_  
The term “Top Off” refers to the patient calling you back because they are experiencing more pain. This is usually in the later phase of active labor down in the perineal area and close to full cervical dilation.  
The increase in pain is usually from the afferent nerves innervating the cervix, perineum and vagina via the pudendal nerve at the S2-S4 dermatomes.  
  
**You must be careful how much you administer for a “Top Off”  
**Always strive to administer the smallest effective dose of local anesthetic to achieve patient comfort and mobility. _You still want the patient to feel pressure and be able to push for delivery._**You need to find out how dilated the parturient is.** If your patient is > 8cm dilated, you know she is close to delivery.  
At this point, your goal is to relieve the perineal pain while preserving motor function, thus maintaining the maternal pushing effort. So you do not want to administer a concentrated local anesthetic that induces a motor block.  
  
**Common Top off Doses  
**8-10 ml of 1% lidocaine  
8-10 ml of 2% 2-chloroprocaine  
  
**If the parturient is not ready to deliver:**  
8-10 cc of the same local anesthetic is common.  
10-14 ml of 1% lidocaine  
10-14 ml of 2% 2-chloroprocaine  
**  
Fully dilated - ready to deliver**  
5 ml of the same local anesthetic you have been using  
**  
Not ready to deliver  
**8-10 ml of the same local anesthetic you have been using  
Some practitioners will add 2 ml (100 mcg) of Fentanyl.  
  
**Other Top-Off Doses  
**6 mL of 0.125% bupivacaine  
6mL of or 0.1% ropivacaine  
May repeat if needed  
  
**Positioning with a Top Off Dose  
**Sit the patient up at 90 degrees and give a bolus of your local anesthetic. The gravity aids the caudal movement of the local anesthetics down to the S2-S4 dermatomes. It is easier to bathe that area while in the sitting position vs supine. Consider giving the top-off bolus in divided doses, observing for changes in sensorium or vital signs.  
  
**Notify the RN that you are giving top-off**  
The RN must be at the patient’s bedside when dosing epidural.  
  
Record the sensory level both before and after your intervention, as well as vital signs (including fetal heart tones).  
  
Be sure that you have ephedrine readily available as well as a working IV prior to any top offs.  
  
Also, stay in constant communication with the patient during top offs in order to evaluate CNS changes that may result from an unanticipated bolus of local anesthetic in the intravascular or intrathecal space.  
  
Chart the top off bolus and record 3 sets of BP's as well as the FHR.  
  
If there is no improvement, check sensory level and epidural site again. The catheter may have migrated out of the epidural space.If a patient is for VBAC, notify OB if patient still complains of pain after reasonable top-up is given with evidence of motor block.  
  
Several “top off” regimens are appropriate, depending on nature of the patient’s pain.  
  
**If the patient has a dense motor block but a low dermatomal sensory level**  
Consider administering a relatively LARGE volume of a LOW concentration local anesthetic such as:  
0.125% bupivacaine  
or  
1% lidocaine  
or  
a bolus from the 0.1% bupivacaine epidural pump solution  
or  
0.2% ropivicaine.  
  
Most epidurals that are providing some level of sensory block can usually be rescued by adding enough volume of local anesthetic.  
  
**If the patient has a weak or equivocal block and is in great discomfort**  
Consider a 5 ml of 2% lidocaine or 0.25 % bupivacaine.  
If the parturient has had no relief with epidural it is most likely nonfunctioning and needs to be replaced.  
  
100 mcg of fentanyl per epidural and/or a few ml of a high concentration local anesthetic such as 0.25 % bupivacaine or 2% lidocaine is often helpful when delivery is imminent and the patient is complaining of perineal pain.  
  
Similarly, a HIGH concentration local anesthetic and fentanyl per epidural are useful prior to vacuum or forceps delivery and for manual extraction of the placenta and laceration repairs.
