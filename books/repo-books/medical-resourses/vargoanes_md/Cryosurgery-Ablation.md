### Cryosurgery Ablation-Prostate

**Indications:** Prostate Cancer

This procedure is considered by many an excellent, minimally invasive treatment and alternative to surgery or radiation and brachytherapy using seed implantation.

Cryosurgery causes tumor death by freezing. For tissue death, the cryosurgical probe must be -50C and colder. Some devices produce temperatures as low as -240C (-400F).  
A rep arrives with large Argon and Helium gas cylinders. For this procedure, a real-time transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) is utilized to monitor probe placement and freezing.

Tiny needles called cryoprobes (Cryoneedles), which regulate the freezing and temperature of the prostate, are inserted through the perineum. From there, they are advanced into the gland while being guided by ultrasound images. Special argon gas, which flows through the cryoprobes, is used in the freezing process. Upon reaching the proper temperature, an ice ball forms in the organ. By maintaining these extremely cold temperatures for up to 10 minutes, the tumor and the cancerous cells are destroyed. The temperature is very closely monitored. Once the freezing is complete, helium gas released through the cryoprobes is used in the thawing process. In addition, the use of a urethral warmer or warming catheter protects the urethra from the cold temperatures, eliminating damage to surrounding tissue.

**Advantages of Cryosurgery**:  
Less invasive.  
Less bleeding.  
Less complication.  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT or LMA.  
**Note**: Some doctors will demand relaxation because unexpected movement can cause perforation.  
**Position:** Lithotomy with a Transrectal approach.  
**Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable

**Possible Complications:**  
Bleeding or blood in the urine.  
Soreness or swelling in the region where the needles are placed.  
Swelling around the penis or scrotum.  
Freezing may affect the bladder and intestines, which can lead to pain and burning sensations.
