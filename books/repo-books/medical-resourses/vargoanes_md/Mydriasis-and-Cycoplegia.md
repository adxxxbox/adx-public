# Mydriasis and Cycoplegia

**Mydriasis and Cycoplegia**  
Mydriasis is pupil dilation.  
**Cycloplegia** is paralysis of the ciliary muscle of the eye, resulting in a loss of accommodation.  
Circular muscles of the iris that constrict the pupil are innervated by cholinergic fibers from the 3rd cranial nerve, whereas fibers from the same nerve cause contraction of the ciliary muscles, allowing the lens to become more convex.  
Anti-cholinergic drugs placed topically on the cornea block the action of acetylcholine at both these sites, resulting in mydriasis and cycloplegia.  
Complete recovery of mydriasis and cycloplegia produced by topical atropine requires 7 to 14 days  
Patients with glaucoma, relaxation of the ciliary muscles produced by an anti-cholinergic drug , may occlude the angular space, whereas mydriasis obstructs passage of intraocular fluid into the venous circulation, resulting in potentially hazardous increases in intraocular pressure.  
The mydriasis caused by an anti-cholinergic drug, can be offset by an anti-cholinesterase drug (topically).
