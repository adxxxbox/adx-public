Awake Minimally Invasive Brain Biopsy    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Awake Minimally Invasive Brain Biopsy

Awake biopsies are less invasive than open craniotomy.  
  
**Indications:** To assess brain tumor type and grade  
Results take five to seven days.  
  
**Anesthesia:  
Pre-op:**  
\- CBC and BMP  
\- Type and screen  
\- Ensure adequate blood products are available  
\- Ensure preoperative steroid and anticonvulsants are continued  
**\- IVs:** Two, one should be 18G if blood transfusion is required.  
\- The second IV may be started with intraoperative sedation if the patient is over-anxious.  
  
Complete neurological assessment**Assess for obstructive sleep apnea:** These patients may be informed that they may receive less sedation due to airway risk.  
\- Be aware that the occurrence rate for conversion to open craniotomy is 1-2%.  
\- Be vigilant; a change in the patient’s responsiveness may indicate an intracranial bleed.  
\- It could be catastrophic if a brain biopsy needle perforates a cerebral blood vessel.  
**Room set-up:**  
\- Intubation equipment  
\- Medications drawn up for general anesthesia  
\- Phenylephrine drip available and connected to the patient’s IV.  
\- Albumin and PRBCs should be readily available  
\- Available blood tubing: Does not need to be primed, but hanging  
\- Arterial line equipment  
\- Subglottic airway (LMA)-a temporary insertion is rarely required  
\- Nasopharyngeal airway  
\- Oral airway  
  
**Make sure the patient voids before surgery.**  
  
**Anesthesia concerns:**  
\- Airway obstruction  
\- Hypoventilation and hypercarbia  
\- Oxygen desaturation  
\- Intracranial bleeding  
  
**Pre-op sedation:**  
\- Small dexmedetomidine boluses starting in pre-op (.25mcg/kg total)  
**\- Antibiotics:** Cefazolin 2G (3G if over 120kg) before incision  
**\- Ondansetron:** Pre-op or before incision  
**\- Note:** Nausea and vomiting may occur intraoperatively  
  
**Anesthesia type:** Light MAC  
Patients need to be able to follow commands and respond during the biopsy portion of the procedure.**Intra-operative light sedation:** Remifentanil or dexmedetomidineDexmedetomidine infusion 0.2 to 1.0 mcg/kg/hour or  
Remifentanil at 0.03 to 0.07 mcg/kg/min  
  
**Note:** Dexmedetomidine causes less respiratory depression than other sedatives and opioids.  
  
The surgeon will infiltrate pin sites with 1 or 2% lidocaine before applying skull pins.**With applying skull pins, consider a small bolus of:  
\- Remifentanil bolus:** 10 mcg as needed or  
**\- Propofol:** 10 to 30 mg as needed or**\- Fentanyl:** 25 to 50 mcg**Positioning:** Depends on the location of the biopsy  
Always have quick access to the patient’s airway if airway manipulation is required.**Avoid head movement:  
\-** Head movement is strongly discouraged if a stereotactic navigation system is being utilized to  
locate and guide the needle biopsy.  
\- Screwdrivers are necessary to remove the frame for emergency intubation.  
\- Skull pins will also require to be removed for intubation.  
\- Be gentle with any airway manipulation (jaw-thrust), as the cranium will be pinned for stability.  
  
**Once pinned:** Lighten sedation so the patient can respond and follow commands during the biopsy portion of the procedure.  
**\- Airway:** Nasal cannula or facemask with ETCO 2 monitoring  
**\- Monitoring:** Standard ASA monitors  
**\- A-Line:** Not needed  
**\- BP goal:** Normotension (SBP < 140)  
\- **Foley catheter:** No  
**\- Lower body Bair hugger:** Yes, or warm blankets-keep normothermic  
**\- Duration:** 1 to 1.5 hours  
**\- IV fluids:** Don’t over hydrate; the patient will request to void  
**\- Dexamethasone:** 10 mg (ask surgeon when to administer)\- **Nicardipine:** PRN for BP control during and after biopsy  
  
**Post-op:**  
Post-op nurses should be informed to closely assess neurologic status in case of intracranial bleed.  
  
**First signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP):**  
\- Hypertension  
\- Headache  
\- Nausea  
\- Vomiting  
\- Altered LOC  
\- Nonreactive pupils  
  
**Possible complications:**  
\- Swelling in the brain  
\- Intracranial bleed  
\- Infection  
\- Stroke  
\- Blood clots  
\- Hypoxia/hypoventilation- over-sedation from anesthesia  
\- Seizures  
\- Coma
