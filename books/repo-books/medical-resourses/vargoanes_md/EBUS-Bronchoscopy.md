### EBUS-Endobronchial Ultrasound Guided Bronchoscopy

Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is just a fancy bronchoscopy that utilizes a fine guided needle aspiration to biopsy mediastinal nodes. The tracheal wall is penetrated to access the nodes just outside the trachea. The duration of these cases is longer than the traditional bronchoscopy. We usually intubate these patients. 

Mediastinoscopy has been the ‘gold standard’ method for determining the presence of nodal metastases in the mediastinum.

The EBUS has been widely adopted by pulmonologists and is poised to replace the mediastinoscopy in the future because it is less invasive.  

**Anesthetic**: General/ETT, sometimes an LMA.

Warning: an 8.0mm ETT is too small for this procedure. An 8.5mm ETT is a pretty tight fit for the EBUS tube to slide through. A 9.0mm ETT is strongly recommended.  

Have a pair of scissors handy because you will need to shorten the ETT after intubation.  
The EBUS tube has an inflatable cuff (like a pilot balloon cuff on an ETT) that has been known to rupture while passing through an 8.5mm ETT.  
Many times a 9.0mm or 8.5mm ETT is too large to pass the cords, so don’t force it. An LMA is commonly used when the patient’s glottis is too narrow for an 8.5mm ETT. However, it is usually more difficult to ventilate the patient with an LMA during a bronchoscopy. Much more difficult.  
  
**LMA NOTE:** You will need to remove (cut) the bars at the junction of the tube and mask so the EBUS tube could slide through the LMA.

LMA is indicated when the upper paratracheal nodes are the target. An ETT passes the cords and obstructs access to the upper paratracheal nodes. Make sure the LMA has an adequate seal.  LMAs are also commonly used when the patient’s glottis is too narrow for an 8 ETT. However, it is usually more difficult to ventilate the patient with an LMA during a bronchoscopy. Much more difficult.

**Cocktail:** Usually give 2mg Versed and 2cc of Fentanyl.

**Relaxant:** Depends on the duration. These cases can be over an hour. Relaxing the patient does make it easier. Find out from the surgeon ahead of time.  
**LTA Kit:** Yes, it helps. The doctors rarely numb the cords ahead of time for a general procedure. Many CRNAs still don’t bother using one. But I always do.  
**Propofol Infusion:** Usually not needed if you relax the patient. If you do not relax the patient, either administer Propofol manually or use a pump and titrate to effect. Sevoflurane alone usually does not prevent the patient from gagging or coughing once the Anectine is metabolized. My editor swears by purple haze! Forane is the best ever for these cases. It blunts the stress responses and the laryngotracheal responses to stimuli much more effectively. If there is early coughing, he will start with high dose Sevoflurane and then switch as soon as possible to Forane.  
  
**Narcotics:** We usually minimize narcotics and use more Propofol when indicated because Propofol is shorter acting than fentanyl.

**Bronchoscope Swivel Adapter:** Make sure you have one ahead of time. Most of the time they are located with the bronchoscopy cart.

It looks like your ventilator elbow connector except it has a small port with a removable rubber cap. While the patient is being ventilated, the bronchoscope can be inserted through the port (when cap is removed) without disconnecting the ventilator. This allows bronchoscope access to the airway while maintaining ventilation, oxygenation, and PEEP. You still may have to manually ventilate during periods of desaturations.   

**Duration:** 5-30 minutes.  
**IV Access:** a 20G is acceptable.

**The main risks from bronchoscopy:**  
Bleeding from biopsy sites.  
Infection  
Laryngospasms (MAC case).

**There is also a small risk of:**  
Arrhythmias  
Breathing difficulties  
Fever  
Heart attack in people with existing heart disease  
Low blood oxygen  
Pneumothorax  
Sore throat
