### EGD (Esophagogastroduodenoscopy)

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is a procedure during which a small flexible endoscope is introduced through the mouth and advanced through the pharynx, esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. It can be diagnostic or therapeutic.  
An EGD alone is rarely done as a lone procedure. It usually also involves a quick biopsy, removing gastric or duodenal polyps, foreign objects or dilation of esophageal strictures.

Many cases are still done without anesthesia by using conscious sedation (large doses of Versed and Demerol). When Anesthesia is involved, we usually use Propofol.

General anesthesia is often used in a selected group of patients who are difficult to sedate due to chronic narcotics intake, on ADD meds, or have a history of wakefulness during an anesthetic. We are also doing more cases with patients who have severe OSA or high BMIs because Propofol clears the system quicker than the Demerol and Versed. Demerol and Versed (conscious sedation), can be given by an RN without the presence of an anesthesia provider. As soon as the patient gets in the room, you need to put a NC with ETCO2 sampling on so the patient could build up their FRC (reserve) while you are connecting the other monitors. Some GI labs are efficient with little time between the patient entering the room and the start of the procedure.  
**Equipment:** Appropriate size oral airway, suction and Ambu bag within arm’s reach.

**Bite Block:**  
A bite block is placed between the teeth to prevent the patient from biting on the endoscope**.** Make sure the bite block is carefully inserted before you start giving them Propofol.

The patient is more prone to a laryngospasm if they are too light or if the Gastroenterologist doesn’t watch the tip of the endoscope as it passes by the vocal cords and down the upper esophagus.

**Anesthetic**: General; usually a Propofol Infusion or serial manual doses of Propofol.  
**Lidocaine bolus:** Yes. Recommendation is 50-100mg bolus of Lidocaine, <1.5mg/kg  
just prior to the tube insertion may drastically decrease the onset of a laryngospasm.  
In addition to Propofol, some CRNAs also give 2mg of Versed or combine the Versed with Ketamine. Personally, I have seen Ketamine given at 0.25-0.40 mg/kg divided over the course of the procedure.  I’ve seen CRNAs administer Versed pre-op, and then a bolus of 20mg of Ketamine and 30mg of Propofol before the scope is initially inserted. Note that some patients might need a small dose of an antisialogogue (Robinul 0.2 mg) before a Ketamine dose is given.  
**Bedside Meds:** Robinul, Atropine, Ephedrine and Anectine.  
**Duration:** 5-10 minutes  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**Position:** Head of bed up 25-30%; most patients are left lateral, some are supine.  
**Muscle relaxation:** Not needed  
**IV Access:** 22G is acceptable  
  
**Airway issues:**

Do not hesitate to manipulate the airway (jaw thrust) if the patient starts to obstruct during the procedure. Do not hesitate to tell the GI doc to pull out the endoscope if you can’t manage the airway while the endoscope or dilator is in. Don’t feel bad; I could assure you it is not the first time. The doctor may continue when the SaO2 returns to a safe level.

**Bite Block Removal**

When the procedure is complete, do not remove the bite block until the patient can follow commands and open their mouth. You can damage the patient’s teeth pulling the bite block out too soon.

**More Notes**  
An enteroscope, a longer endoscope, can be introduced beyond the ligament of Treitz into the jejunum. Most modern endoscopes now use a video chip, a charged coupled device for better imaging, as opposed to the older endoscopes, in which fiber optics are used for image transmission.

An EGD very rarely results in gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation (tearing) that may need additional surgery to repair. In general, the procedure is not associated with very much risk.

**Possible Complications**  
Laryngeal spasm while advancing the tube  
Esophageal perforation
