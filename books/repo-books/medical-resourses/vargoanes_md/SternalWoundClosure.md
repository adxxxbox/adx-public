### Sternal Wound Closure or I & D of Sternal Wound

  

(Plastic surgeons are often consulted for these procedures).

Deep Sternal Wound Infection (DSWI) is a life-threatening complication after a median sternotomy from cardiac surgery. Dehiscence and mediastinitis may occur with high a morbidity and mortality.  
  
**Current management of sternal wound infection include:**  
\- Irrigation and debridement of the sternum  
\- Sternal rewiring  
\- Vac-pac application  
\- Pectoralis major flaps  
\- Sternal plating and pectoralis major flap  
\- Pectoralis major flap transposition

VAC therapy (negative pressure wound therapy) plus delayed sternal plating and additional bilateral pectoralis major flap advancement as first repair option is popular with DSWI.

Omentoplasty is usually reserved for cases in which the sternum has recurrently fallen open after previous sternal plate refixation, or for cases in which the sternum defect is too extended. This appears to be rare

**Indications**  
\- Non-infected sternal instability  
\- Deep sternal wound infection without sternal instability  
\- Deep sternal wound infection with sternal instability

**Common pathogens involved with DSWI**  
\- Staphylococcus aureus  
\- Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)  
_\- Staphylococcus epidermis_  
_\- Escherichia coli_  
_\- Klebsiella pneumonia_

Omentoplasty is usually reserved for cases in which the sternum has recurrently fallen open after previous sternal plate refixation, or for cases in which the sternum defect is too extended. This appears to be rare.

**Anesthesia - Short story  
**Most of these patients are from a recent status post open heart procedure. Don't be alarmed when you see arrive to pre-op in their ICU bed because they are usually stable with a repaired heart. These patients are usually NOT on any cardiac drips, but may require some BP assistance with a Neosynephrine drip.

**Pre-op**  
Besides your basic pre-op examination, concentrate on the patient's cardiac history. Most of their cardiac issues were recently surgically corrected.

**Anesthesia:** General/ETT                           

**Muscle relaxation:** Usually required for muscle flaps and/or closure

**Duration:** 30 minutes to 3 hours

**IV Access:** 20-18G

**EBL:** 20-100mLs

**Position:** Supine with arms out or tucked.

**A-line:** Usually not needed

**Closing The Chest**  
If the surgeon is closing the chest, the patient's pressure may drop in the process. This should be treatable with some with some ephedrine or neosynephrine. If it becomes an issue, inform the surgeon.

**Complications**  
\- Bleeding  
\- Sternal instability  
\- Paradoxical motion and pain

**More Notes**

Sternal dehiscence is the process of separation of the bony sternum, which often is accompanied by mediastinitis.

Postoperative sternal wound infection is clearly associated with sternal dehiscence, whether the sternal wound infection has caused the sternal dehiscence or the sternal dehiscence has caused the sternal wound infection is usually not known.

**The use of VAC helps:**  
\- Decrease wound dressing changes  
\- Promotes granulation tissue  
\- Allows for smaller wounds to heal with secondary intention  
\- Decreases edema in the tissues

**The etiology of sternal wound complications:**  
\- Osteopenia  
\- Malnutrition  
\- Diabetes  
\- Immunosuppression  
  
**Perioperative factors that increase the risk for sternal dehiscence:**  
\- Prolonged operative time  
\- Chest compressions  
\- Postoperative bleeding  
\- Transfusion  
\- Reoperation

One of the most common reasons for mediastinal infections, and ultimate sternal dehiscence, is sternal instability.

Following a sternotomy, the structural integrity of the sternum is compromised. The surgeon needs to use meticulous technique when performing a sternotomy. If a midline sternotomy is not placed properly, sternal instability is almost certain to follow.

When the sternal wires become loose, it may lead to sternal instability, which may lead to skin dehiscence and osteomyelitic infection.

  
**Factors relating to increasing risk of sternal dehiscence:**  
\- Obesity  
\- Diabetes mellitus  
\- COPD  
\- Chronic cough from tobacco abuse  
\- Steroid therapy  
\- Hypertension  
\- Immunosuppression  
\- Advanced age  
  
**Operative risk factors:**  
\- Single or bilateral internal mammary artery (IMA) harvesting  
\- Prolonged operation  
\- Excessive hemorrhage  
\- Reoperation  
\- Break in sterile technique  
\- Use of an intra-aortic balloon pump
