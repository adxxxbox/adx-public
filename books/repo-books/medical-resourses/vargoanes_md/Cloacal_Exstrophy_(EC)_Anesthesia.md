### Cloacal Exstrophy (EC) Anesthesia

**Cloacal Exstrophy** (**EC**) is a severe birth defect in which much of the bladder and intestines **are exposed outside** the abdominal wall. It often causes the splitting of both male and female genitalia and the anus is occasionally sealed.  
  
In boys, the penis is usually flat and short with the exposed inner surface of the urethra on top. The penis is sometimes split into a right and left half.  
  
In girls, the clitoris is split and there may be one or two vaginal orifices.

EC is also known as **OEIS Syndrome** because of the four features that are typically found together:

1.  **Omphalocele:** Some of the abdominal organs protrude through an opening in the abdominal muscles in the area of the umbilical cord-contained by a sac.
2.  **Exstrophy of the bladder and rectum:** The bladder is open and separated into two halves. The rectum and colon are similarly open and the segment of the rectum is placed between the bladder halves on the surface of the abdomen.
3.  **Imperforate anus:** The anus has not been formed or perforated and the colon connects to the bladder.
4.  **Spinal defects:** These defects may either be major or minor. Often children born with cloacal exstrophy are also born with some degree of spina bifida. Cloacal exstrophy is an extremely rare birth defect, present in only one in 200,000 pregnancies—one in 400,000 live births.

**Surgical Procedures May Include:**  
**Spinal and Abdominal Repair:** The first surgical consideration is repair of any coexistent spinal abnormality, and perhaps repair of a large omphalocele. Closing the bladder and creating a colostomy for stool elimination repairs the omphalocele.

**Osteotomies:** A second stage is usually working on the bladder. The orthopedic surgeon will perform osteotomies to help ensure that the child's pelvis can best support the bladder over time. During the osteotomy the hip bones are cut and adjusted. The child will need to be in traction for several weeks following this surgery.

**Pull-through procedure:** The purpose of this procedure is to connect the colon to the rectum. Subsequent surgeries may also involve major urinary reconstructive surgery and further genital reconstruction.

**Short summary of Anesthetic Plan**  
From an anesthetic standpoint, these cases are long, all day cases, with a muscle relaxant needed initially and at closing. Blood loss is minimal but there is an insensible loss that can be easily maintained with a good fluid plan.  
  
**Preoperative Evaluation and Questions:**  
Find out the severity of the spinal cord deformity. No regional shall be performed if there are any spinal cord issues. Also keep in mind the potential for decreased sensation in the lower extremities. There is a high association of bladder exstrophy patients and a latex allergy. These patients should all be treated with latex precautions.

**Pre-op room set up and what to prepare.**  
Heat loss is a huge issue that can easily be avoided with the correct preparation. It is important to increase the room temperature, utilize underbody warmers, fluid warmers and bair huggers. These patients should be type and screened. Maintenance IV fluid (MIVF) should be on a pump.

If there is no spinal cord abnormality, proceed with epidural placement. If there is an abnormality, use long acting narcotics, pain service (if available) and a PCA post-op. If osteotomies are performed, the patient will need an ICU bed because of increased amounts of narcotics post op **due to immobility needed for the osteotomies and associated traction.**

**Possible Airway issues:** Usually none  
**Anesthetic and Induction:** ETT/RSI  
For initial repair of omphalocele, IV and RSI induction with stomach decompression is best. Most of these patients are inpatients with an OG/NG tube and already have an IV. Don’t be afraid to place an OG prior to induction to empty the stomach as much as possible. Consider giving robinul or atropine prior to suctioning the stomach to prevent bradycardia.

**Regional-Caudal:** If there is no spinal cord abnormality, a tunneled epidural is the best management plan**.**

**Intraoperative Goals and Events**  
Initially with the osteotomies, there can be some blood loss. Watch for the blood loss and replace the volume as needed. Maintaining fluid status in these patients can be tricky. There are large insensible fluid losses and with the bladder open in the field, an adequate urine output is difficult to assess. Assessing vitals signs, labs and good communication with the surgeon as to the urine output is important.

**Nitrous:** Avoid

**Muscle Relaxation:** Very helpful for the osteotomies and for abdominal closure. Monitor peak inspiratory airway pressures while closing the abdomen.

**IV Access:** One large bore peripheral and a PICC line is common. If they come from the NICU, they usually have a low femoral PICC line. Sometimes a PICC line will be inserted after the patient goes to sleep in the antecubital fossa. Low femoral is usually the second choice for a PICC line in the operating room.

**Hydration:** 4:2:1  
Follow intake and output closely and use a fluid plan to account for insensible losses. Monitor labs, i.e. lactate, H&H, base excess and replace fluids accordingly.  
Have NS or LR and albumin ready.  
**(below is just a common reference)**  
Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**A-line:** Not usually needed

**Position:** Supine case until the end. At the very end of the case they are pulled low on the bed to facilitate traction for the osteotomies. Make sure you have tubing slack and protect the airway.

**Age Range:** This is a staged surgery. The primary starting range is at 2-4 weeks of life. Ideal age of cloacal reconstruction seems to be between 6 and 12 month.

**Duration:** Very long.

**Primary Repair:** First stage osteotomies and bladder repair- 8-10 hours.

**EBL:** 150-250, most occurs during the osteotomy.**  
  
Possible Complications:**  
\- Aspiration with induction  
\- Infection  
\- Hemorrhage  
\- Hypothermia - lots of exposed body surface area  
\- Increases peak inspiratory pressures during closure  
\- Vaginal and urethral complications with a common channel > 3 cm  
\- Rectal prolapse-depending on the quality of the perineal muscles  
\- Perineal wound  
\- Increased PIP at closure, avoid nitrous and communicate with your surgeon.

**Extubation Criteria:** Awake  
Crying (must be visualized, cannot be heard when ETT in place)  
Eyes open? Grasping for tube?

**Transport:** Back to ICU -Post op

**Post-Operative Concerns:** Adequate sedation is needed for immobility while maintaining preventing respiratory depression.  
Close post-op monitoring is vital.
