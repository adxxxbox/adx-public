### V-Tachy Ablation

These cases usually don’t require our services unless the EP Cardiologist is concerned about the patient’s airway, or the patient may be morbidly obese, have OSA, or even be elderly and uncooperative. This case involves the right heart. Theoretically it could be a deep MAC, but most of the time we simply put the patient to sleep-intubate and not worry how long the case may be.  
  
Ventricular arrhythmias tend to be more serious than supraventricular arrhythmias and are generally life threatening. VT most often arises from areas of scar tissue in the ventricle, which is the result of a heart attack. However, VT can also occur in a normal, healthy heart. Ablation can be used to treat VT in some instances. 

Studies show that patients with stable VT, a previous MI and reduced LVEF should have a Prophylactic VT ablation before placing a ICD. Especially in patients with an LVEF of > 30%.    

**Anesthetic:** Usually General/LMA or ETT. Depends on the facility. It is usually easier just to intubate and not worry about movement. Some of theses cases can be very long so most of us intubate anyway.  
Deep MAC with a Propofol infusion is still done is some facilities. I have even seen a Precedex infusion and the patient still did well.

**Muscle Relaxant:** If you are intubating, you might as well relax the patient. No contraindications exist from a surgical standpoint.      
**EBL:** Hopefully minimal  
**IV Access:** 18g.   
**IV Tubing Extension:** It helps. Tubing extension with a 3-way stopcock to administer meds without having to get up right next to the patient is becoming more popular. The less radiation exposure, the better.    
**A-line:** Not required because the left heart is not being ablated.  
**Position:** Supine with arms tucked.  
**Foley:** Sometimes  
**Hydration:** Normovolemic

**Esophageal Temp Probe:** Not needed  
**Neosynephrine Drip:** Yes. Available and plugged into distal IV port.  
**Emergency Meds**: Yes, diluted Epinephrine and Ephedrine are your drugs of choice for a possible cardiac tamponade. Have them ready.  
**Lead Apron:** Make sure you get one that fits because you will be wearing it a long time.  
**Drips:** Usually Neosynephrine; titrate to effect.  
Depending on the EP lab you are in, there is usually a limited amount of anesthesia space.    
   
**Possible Complications:**  
Cardiac Tamponade –from puncturing the heart  
Inadvertent puncture of the femoral artery  
Femoral vein hematoma.
