### Reversal of Anticoagulation

**Administer protamine**  
The venous cannula is removed prior to protamine administration. The arterial cannula is removed either prior to, during or after protamine administration ( according to the surgeon’s preference).  
  
The timing of protamine administration is determined by the surgeon. The perfusionist may calculate the dose, otherwise give the standard dose. _(Protamine is supplied as 10 mg/ml, so, for example, if heparin (1,000 units/ml) had been administered, then protamine 30 ml would be given.)_  
  
If they don’t, just give the standard dose.  
_Protamine comes as 10 mg/mL, so if you gave 30mLs of Heparin (1,000u/mL), then give 30 mL of protamine._  
  
**Other Doses**  
**Protamine dose:** 3-4mg/kg regardless of how much Heparin was given earlier.**  
OR  
**1.0-1.3mg of Protamine for each 100 units of Heparin.  
  
Protamine comes in 10mg/ml.  
  
3-4 mg/kg for a 70kg patient = 210-280mg or 21-28 ml of protamine.  
  
Protamine should be administered slowly because it can induce hypotension. Notify surgeon when half has been administered, if surgeon so wishes.
