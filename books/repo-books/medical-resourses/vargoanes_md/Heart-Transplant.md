### Heart Transplant and Anesthesia

**Warning:**  
The new donor heart does not adapt well to pulmonary HTN. Because of this, RV failure is the main cause for early graft failure in heart transplantation.  
You must optimize RV function and prevent RV failure. Severe pulmonary HTN is a big contraindication to heart transplantation. However, the patient’s chronic pulmonary HTN usually goes away a few hours after the transplant.

**Milrinone**: decreases PVR and SVR, but increases SV.  
**Epinephrine:** Decreases PVR, but increases SV, HR and SVR.  
**Levophed:** Not good for pulmonary HTN because it increases PVR.  
**Isuprel:** Decreases PVR and SVR but increases HR and SV.  
   
If the patient is a redo sternotomy or has a Left Ventricular Device (LVAD), the surgeon will want surgery to start an hour before the predicted arrival of the donor heart.

**Drips to have ready in the OR**  
Epinephrine (0.03-0.3 mcg/kg/min)  
Milrinone (0.375-0.75mcg/kg/min)  
Nitroglycerine (5-200mcg/min)  
Insulin Drip: Solu-Medrol elevates the blood sugar.

**Also PGEı or Nitric Oxide (NO) for untreatable Pulmonary HTN.**  
PGEı: (0.025-2mcg/kg/min)  
Nitric Oxide Inhalation: (20-40 PPM)  
Inhaled NO in the post-op period selectively reduces PVR and enhances RV stroke work and reduces the incidence of RV dysfunction.  
**Blood Available:** Yes, 4 units in the OR.

**Pre-op:** The procurement team will instruct you concerning antibiotics, immune-suppressants, what lines you need and desired pressures to aim for, etc.  
Treat the patient like a sick heart, mask O², insert your lines, and don’t over-sedate.

**Remember that these patients are in** **End-Stage Cardiac Failure:**  
Irreversible, severe ventricular dysfunction  
Low CO and EF  
Poor end-organ perfusion  
Cardiac dilation  
Increased LV and pulmonary venous pressures.  
Pulmonary hypertension  
Combined result is cardiomegaly, severe dyspnea, and peripheral edema.  
So remember, they have little reserve; again, don’t give too much sedation.  
You do not put the patient asleep until the surgeon informs you.

**Position:** Supine and arms tucked.  
**Duration:** 3-4 hours  
**EBL:** 500-1,500 mLs  
**Inhalation Agent:** Avoid Nitrous Oxide, it can increase PVR.  
Our common inhaled agents are well known myocardial depressants, but are still fairly well tolerated unless there is significant heart failure.  
**Antibiotics**: Vancomycin and Aztreonam are commonly ordered.  
**BIS Monitor:** Yes

**Induction:** Some literature says to use a RSI, but most of us don’t. 

Etomidate 0.2-0.3 mg/kg  
Fentanyl 5-10mcg/kg bolus.  
**Intubation:** Oral over nasal because of the potential of infection caused by nasal flora. Also, these patients will be anti-coagulated which contribute to epistaxis.

**Use Strict Aseptic Techniques**  
**IV Access:** 2 large bore IVs; 1 large bore central venous line with 3 lumens.  
Find out if they want a Swan-ganz catheter on the left or right.  
The Swan is preferred to be on the left. However, some facilities use the right IJ because the left side is harder to insert and it does not hinder future access of ventricular biopsies.  
Also, AICDs are usually placed on the left side, making the Left IJ approach difficult.

Another central line is inserted (sometimes later) in the right IJ for post op transvenous right ventricular endomyocardial biopsies to provide early warnings of asymmetrical allograft rejection.

Don’t forget to pull the Swan back to the CVP position before cannulation of aorta.  
Some of these patients have already had a CABG, or other thoracic or mediastinal procedures. So inserting lines may take more time.  
**A-Line:** Yes. If the patient has or will have a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), there will be no arterial pulse to palpate. Use an Ultrasound machine or give an inotrope to stimulate the native LV. Epinephrine 10-20mcg IV should get you a pulse.  
**TEE:** Inserted after induction to assess volume and contractility. It is also used for weaning off bypass.  
**Heparin: be ready to give** 300-400units/kg and check ACT 3 minutes after.  
**LVAD:** If the patient is on an LVAD, the procedure will take more time and they will  
bleed more, since they are already on blood thinners.  
**Goals:** Reduce PVR with dilators and optimal ventilation.

  
**Drugs that decrease PVR:**  
Isuprel, Milrinone, Nitric acid and PGEı.  
Optimize RV function by inotropic support.  
 

**_GOALS_**: Keep MAP> 70mmHg  
**FiO²:** Keep high to maintain a high PaO2 (reduces PVR).  
**CO²:** Hyperventilate; mild hypocarbia (reduces PVR).  
**Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP):** Avoid high PIP. A high PIP increases PVR.  
**If patient is a Redo Sternotomy:** Many of these patients have had a CABG; if so, have PRBCs available in the room.  
**FFP:** Many have large dilated hearts and a low CO making them prone to intracardiac thrombus. They may already be on warfarin and require FFP post bypass.  
**Blood Products:** PRBCs (must be negative for CMV).  
**Temporary A-V Pacer Wires:** Yes. In room.  
**Solu-Medrol:** Yes, 1 gram is common when the cross clamp is removed to prevent hyperacute immune response.  
**Aortic Cannulation:** Drop systolic BP < 100mmHg and pull the Swan-ganz line back.  
**Bicaval Venous Cannulation:** Done after Aortic Cannulation.  
**Bypass:** KVO, like CABGs.  
**Coming Off Bypass:** TEE and recalibrate your lines and keep the PVR under control.  
**Protamine:** Yes, give 1.3-1.5mg for every 100 units of heparin given during the case.  
**CaCl:** Commonly given post pump  
  
**Drips for Coming off Bypass**  
**Isuprel** start drip at 2-6mcg/min to increase the heart rate to100bpm. Newly transplanted hearts are common for junctional rhythms. They are rate dependent so avoid bradycardia.  
**Nitroglycerin**: (0.2-2.0mcg/kg/min) for treatment of PVR.   
**Levophed:** Inotrope.  
**Epinephrine:** Inotrope.  
**Neosynephrine**: For SVR, titrate to effect. Does not cause reflex bradycardia on the new heart.

**For Bradycardia:**  
Treat first with Isuprel (diluted in a syringe). If Isuprel does not work, the BP will have already dropped. Push 10-20mcg of Epinephrine.

  
**For Hypotension not related to Bradycardia:**  
Give Neosynephrine, and then give Epinephrine if needed. 500-1,000mg CaCl also works.

**Change in EKG with the transplanted heart.**  
You may now see 2 P waves: 1 P wave from the old SA node and 1 from the new atrium.  
The native SA node remains intact in cases in which a cuff of atria is left for surgical anastomosis for the grafted heart. However, the P wave cannot cross the suture line to the transplanted heart. It has no effect on HR.

**Inotropes and Drugs that will work on a denervated heart**  
Dobutamine (2.5-20mcg/kg/min)  
Epinephrine: (0.03-0.3 mcg/kg/min)  
Milrinone (0.375-0.75mcg/kg/min)  
Dopamine: (2-10mcg/kg/min)-the weakest of the 4 Inotropes  
Ephedrine: Indirect action  
Propanolol  
Neostigmine  
Isuprel: see next

**Vagolytics –**Atropine and Robinul will not increase HR. That is why we use Isuprel.

**Post bypass HR:** A denervated heart has no sympathetic, parasympathetic, or sensory innervation, and the loss of vagal tone results in a higher than normal resting heart rate around 100bpm.  
Bradycardia occurs in 50% of new transplanted hearts. Isoproteronol actually is more effective in increasing CO than is atrial pacing.

Vagolytics like Atropine and Robinul do not work on a denervated heart.   
  
**Remember:** The CO on a denervated heart is volume dependent. Rate is usually constant.  
  
**Post Bypass Goals:** maintain CO, systemic perfusion and PREVENT right heart failure.  
**HR:** 90-120bpm  
**Systolic BP:** 120-110mmHg.

**Pulmonary Pressure Notes:   Know the 3 below:**

**PAP (Pulmonary Artery Pressure)**  
Mean Pulmonary Arterial Pressure (MPAP) is normally 9 - 18 mmHg.  
  
**PVR (Pulmonary Vascular Resistance)**  
PVR= (MPAP-PCWP) / (CO) x 80  
Normal PVR is 100-130 dyn·second·cm¯5; sometimes referred to as mmHg·min/l.  
  
**TPG (Transpulmonary Gradient)**  
TPG= MPAP – PCWP (normal is 6 mmHg)

**High Risk Values for early perioperative RV Failure:**  
PAP of >60mmHg and/or PVR >200 dyn·s·cm\-5   
and/or a TPG of >15 mmHg

**Factors Reducing PVR:**  
Hypocarbia and increased PaO2  
Alkalemia/alkalosis  
Hyperkalemia  
Deep Anesthesia  
Vasodilators  
Avoidance of sympathetic stimulation  
Minimize intrathoracic pressure by Normal lung volumes and avoid high ventilator peak pressures.
