Croup-Post Extubation (post extubation laryngeal edema)   

### Croup-Post Extubation (post extubation laryngeal edema)

**Most common cause:** Inappropriate large ETT

**Etiology:** Cuff pressure against the tracheal mucosa. Tracheal mucosa perfusion is impaired at pressures above 25cmH20 and the mucosa ischemia ensues when the pressure exceeds 30cmH20. The pressure from a tightly fitting uncuffed ETT or overinflated cuffed ETT causes tracheal ischemic damage and edema. This narrows the subglottic airway. Sometimes edema can occur at the glottis level. Despite the different etiology of infectious croup, both have similar pathophysiology with the same outcome, an edematous narrowed airway.

**Age range:** Highest incidence between 1-4 years of age

**Prevention:** Regardless of using a cuffed or uncuffed ETT, always have a leak around the ETT at or below 25cmH20 to prevent impaired perfusion of the trachea mucosa.

**When it occurs:** Usually within 30-60 minutes post extubation

**Symptoms:** Barking or croupy cough, hoarseness and stridor

**Severe symptoms:  
**\- Nasal flaring  
\- Respiratory retractions  
\- Hypoxemia  
\- Cyanosis  
\- Decreased LOC**  
  
Treatment:  
**\- Cold Humidified O2 or air  
\- Nebulizer treatments with racemic epi- 0.5mL of 2.25% solution in 3-5mL of NSS  
\- Decadron IV- however the peak onset is 4 hours
