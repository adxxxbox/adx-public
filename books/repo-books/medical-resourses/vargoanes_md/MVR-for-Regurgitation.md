### Mitral Valve Replacement (MVR) for Regurgitation

The removal of the defective leaky valve and placement of a new one.

**Common Pre-op diagnosis**:  
Class 3 or 4 CHF  
MR is also known as Mitral Insufficiency

Find out if this an Acute or Chronic Mitral valve. Also is the ventricle impaired?  
MVR procedure is similar, regardless if it’s acute or chronic.  

**Acute MR**: Develops quickly and can be life-threatening. It happens when the valve or nearby tissue ruptures suddenly. These patients come off pump much easier because everything appears quickly reversible once a new valve is inserted.

**Chronic MR:** The most common type and develops slowly. There can be eccentric hypertrophy with elevated PAP and pulmonary congestion. If the ventricle is impaired,  
patients are more difficult to come off pump.  
LA pressures > 25 mm Hg will lead to acute pulmonary edema, and if present in the long term, will lead to increased PVR.

**The Procedure**  
The left atrium is exposed through a ventricle incision in the left atrium posterior to the atrial septum. The surgeon excises and debrides the valve leaflets and applies sutures to the rim of the annulus. This is where the new valve is passed through and sutured in place to the rim of the annulus.

After filling the LV and atrium with blood, the atrium is closed, air evacuated from the left heart and the cross clamp removed to allow coronary perfusion.

**Pre-op Equipment and IV Access**:  
Same as a CABG

Some departments place the patient’s lines in a pre-op area; others will wait until they get to the operating room.  
  
ALWAYS SEDATE!  
**Catheters**  
2 large peripheral IVs 16-18 gauge with liter of LR  
A-line  
PA Catheter  
Trauma line or a Cordis  

**PA Line Ports**:  
**connect the White** line which is trifurcated to these 3: Neo drip, Nitro drip, and LR.  
**Brown** to CVP  
**Blue** to PA  
(Colors vary in different hospitals)  
Cordis or Trauma line: The blood tubing port: connect main blood tubing.

Have 2 blood sets –one on warmer, one to trauma cord.

  
Make sure all IVs run well BEFORE and AFTER the arms are tucked. I have seen terrible infiltrations with tucked arms.

Anesthetic Goals  
Pre-bypass**: (Full, Fast, Forward)**  
Coming off Pump**: OK to use Neosynephrine and other vasoconstrictors. There is a new mitral valve.

**Pre-bypass**:  
**Rate**: Fast, avoid bradycardia because ventricular distention causes increased LAP and pulmonary congestion. Tachycardia reduces diastolic ventricular volume and wall tension and diastolic BP, which increases coronary perfusion and offsets increases in O² demands secondary to the increased HR.

**EKG**: Maintain sinus: but sometimes they are in A-fib. They may have a broadened and/or notched P wave.

**Preload:** Keep full or slightly increased.

**Afterload:** Decrease the afterload: vasodilation promotes forward flow. You might need more volume to maintain flow. Avoid sudden increases in SVR. Consider a nitroglycerine drip to decrease an elevated SVR. Hypotension should be treated with inotropes and volume, not with vasoconstrictors, which will worsen pulmonary HTN.

**  
Induction**: Avoid decreases in SVR and bradycardia.

  
**Muscle Relaxant**: Rocuronium or Vecuronium. Pavilion is ok if your pharmacy still has it.

**Inhalation Agents**: Isoflurane, Sevoflurane or Desflurane are all good because they increase HR and decrease SVR. They have a minimal cardiac depressant effect.

**Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**EBL:** 200-500mLs  
**Type and Cross:** Yes, have blood available in the room.  
**Aortic Clamp time:** 45-150 minutes.

**Note**: For any open heart, barbiturates or Etomidate may be given when the cross clamp is removed to avoid micro infarcts of air by Burst Suppressing the patient. Some do this while other departments do not.

  
**CPB Time**: 90-120 minutes.

**Weaning off Bypass**: TEE is essential for coming off bypass for fluid, hemodynamic management and to identify free air. It will give you the LV function and a good look at the results of the new valve. Treat the patient according to their individual needs, just like any other heart.

  
**Milrinone - (Primacor)**  
Basically a good inotropic and vasodilator.  
**Adult Loading Dose-** IV 50 mcg/kg over 10 min  
**Maintenance Infusion**: 0.375-0.75 mcg/kg/min

**Milrinone**:  
Decreases PVR. It is a potent pulmonary vasodilator; great for valves or any patient with pulmonary hypertension.  
Deceases SVR Afterload; as mentioned above.  
Decreases Preload /CVP.  
Enhances relaxation of the left ventricle (the lusitropic effect)  
Decreases PCWP

  
**Neosynephrine Drip**: Titrate to effect. It is OK to use Neo once the new valve is in.  
Other constrictors that increase SVR are also OK.
