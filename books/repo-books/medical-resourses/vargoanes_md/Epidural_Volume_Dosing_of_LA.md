### Epidural Volume Dosing of LA

**_Dr. Alyson Eastep, CRNA Summerton, SC_**  
_The volume of local anesthetic plays a crucial role in the block height._Always know how many dermatome levels your surgical target is from where the epidural needle is inserted.  
**  
Example (Epidural for a C-section)**  
For example, let us say L3-4 is where you inserted the epidural needle and it is for a C-section. A C-section requires a block up to T-4 dermatome (nipple level).

| T4 Nipple |
| T5 |
| T6 |
| T7 |
| T8 |
| T9 |
| T10 Vaginal Delivery |
| T11 |
| T12 |
| L1 |
| L2 |
| L3 |
| L4 Needle |
| L5 |

So there remain 3 lumbar dermatomes caudad to the injection site (L3, L2 and L1) = 3  
8 thoracic dermatomes to reach T4 (T12 up to T4) = 8.  
11 dermatomes x 1-2 ml = 11-22 ml for an L3 to a height of T4.  
The standard volume of local anesthetic for a C-section is 20 ml in increments of 5 ml.  
  
**Example (Epidural for Vaginal Delivery)  
**For example, let us say that L3-4 is where you inserted the epidural needle a vaginal delivery is anticipated.  
The dermatome level for a vaginal delivery requires a T10 sensory block to the uterus.  
So there remain 3 lumbar dermatomes caudad to the injection site (L3, L2 and L1) = 3  
T12 to T10 = 2  
5 dermatomes x 1-2 ml = 5-10 ml of LA.  
The standard initial epidural bolus is around 10 ml (increments of 5 ml)  
  
This dose is sufficient for most parturients regardless of height, because the difference in patient height is attributable mostly to leg length and not to length of the spinal column.  
The S2-4 dermatomes are usually covered with this dose, however, as labor progresses the parturient may become increasingly uncomfortable. The S2-4 nerves are more difficult to block and therefore the parturient may require a top off dose as labor progresses.  
  
A parturient undergoing a vaginal delivery is usually completely comfortable with a 10 ml bolus of 0.2% ropivacaine (2 x 5mL) bolus and an infusion rate of 10 ml per hour to cover a T10 level.  
  
**Other Volume Dosing Considerations  
**When bolusing an epidural, approximately 60-70% of the local anesthetic will travel cephalad and 30-40% of the LA will travel downward (caudad).  
  
Because the range is large and variable-always dose in increments.  
  
**The shorter the patient, the LESS local anesthetic is required  
**A patient that is only 5’3” may require only 1 mL per dermatome while someone who is 6’3” may require the full 2 mL per dermatome. This is why some anesthesia providers administer less volume for short people and more volume for taller people.
