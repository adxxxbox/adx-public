### Neuromonitoring - Types

There are several types of intraoperative monitoring that can be utilized during surgery. The main types include:

**MEPS** (Motor Evoked Potentials): This technique allows signals sent from the brain to certain muscle groups to be monitored. Do not paralyze the patient.

**SSEP/DEPS** (Somatosensory Evoked Potentials / Dermatome Evoked Potentials): This technique allows signals sent to the brain from specific sensory areas to be monitored.

**EMG** (Electromyography): This technique allows signals within certain muscle groups to be monitored during spine surgery. The EMG technique monitors nerves controlling muscle groups during surgery on the part of the spine that controls those muscles. For example:

During cervical neck surgery: The nerves in the upper extremity muscles are monitored.

During thoracic mid-back surgery: The nerves in the abdominal muscle group are monitored.

During lumbar low back surgery: The nerves in lower extremity muscles are monitored.
