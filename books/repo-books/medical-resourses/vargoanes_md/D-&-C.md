D & C (Dilation and Curettage) and Hysteroscopy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### D & C (Dilation and Curettage) and Hysteroscopy

The “D” stands for dilation, which means enlarging.  
The “C” stands for curettage, which means scraping.  
Together, this procedure involves expanding or enlarging the entrance of a woman's uterus so that a thin, sharp instrument can scrape or suction away the lining of the uterus and take tissue samples.  
  
**Hysteroscopy: the first part**  
The uterus is filled with a fluid, such as normal saline or glycine. The hysteroscope is inserted through the cervix into the uterus so the inner surface of the uterus can be examined. Hysteroscopy can locate the cause of bleeding for many women.  

**Anesthetic:** MAC or General/LMA  
If the surgeon says it will be a quick procedure, you might consider a deep MAC.  
The OR staff will wait for you to put your patient to sleep before they lift the legs for lithotomy position.

**Popular cocktail**: 2mg versed, 100mcgs Fentanyl with a Propofol infusion.  
If the patient’s airway looks too challenging, just use an LMA. Most of the time it is easier just to go general and to place an LMA.

Ofirmev is popular for this procedure.  
**Duration:** 10-30 minutes  
**Position:** Lithotomy, arms out and slight Trendelenburg.  
Quickly do your charting because some of these procedures can be pretty fast. Almost all of these women are of child bearing age so consider giving the Zofran/Decadron combination to prevent PONV. We usually give 4mg of each drug.  
**Blood Loss:** 10-40 mLs.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.    
  
**Possible Complications**  
Bleeding  
Perforation of the uterine wall  
Blood clots in the uterus  
Cervical laceration  
Infection  
Adhesions

**Note:** It is rare, but sometimes there will be more bleeding and the surgeon may ask for one of the 3 meds below.  
**Hemabate (Carboprost Tromethamine)**  
Standard dose-250mcg IM  
**Methergine (methylergonovine)**  
Standard Dose: 0.2mg IM.  
**Pitocin (Oxytocin)**  
Standard Dose: 20 units IV
