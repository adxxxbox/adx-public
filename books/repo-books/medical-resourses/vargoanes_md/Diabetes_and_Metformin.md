**Metformin  
Pharmacologic Category:** Antihyperglycemic, Antidiabetic Agent, Biguanide  
**Brand names (US)**  
Glucophage  
Glucophage XR  
Glumetza  
Riomet  
Metformin improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose.  
  
**Mechanism of Action:**  
Decreases hepatic glucose production (hepatic gluconeogenesis).  
Decreasing the intestinal absorption of glucose.  
Increases insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.  
  
**Indications:** As an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adult patients (18 years and older) with type 2 diabetes. It may be used concomitantly with double or triple therapy, or with insulin to improve glycemic control in adults.  
1 st drug of choice in patients with type 2 DM.  
It does not affect insulin secretion, so it is not associated with hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy.  
  
**Off-label indications:  
**Metabolic and reproductive abnormalities associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Treatment for antipsychotic-induced weight gain, treatment.  
Diabetes mellitus, type 2, prevention  
Gestational Diabetes (alternative agent)  
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in women with PCOS due to in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), prevention (alternative agent).  
Anti-cancer, immunoregulatory and anti-aging effects. Becoming a popular prescription from anti-aging doctors.  
  
**Metformin doses for Type 2 DM  
Doses:  
For Type 2 DM  
Immediate release:** Oral  
**Initial:** 500 mg once or twice daily **or** 850 mg once daily (Nathan 2009).  
**Dosage adjustments:** The dose should be increased gradually to minimize GI adverse effects. Titration strategies vary widely, but usually done in 500 mg or 850 mg increments every 7 days (range: 5 days to 1 month)  
  
**Usual maintenance dosage:** 1 g twice daily **or** 850 mg twice daily (Nathan 2009)  
**Maximum:** 2.55 g/day. Modest additional benefit has been observed with doses up to ~2.5 g/day; however, GI adverse effects may limit use (Nathan 2009). If doses >2 g/day are needed, consider administering in 3 divided doses to minimize GI adverse effects.  
  
**Metformin used alone is NOT associated with HYPOglycemia  
**When used as monotherapy; metformin has a very low risk of hypoglycemia.  
When metformin is used in combination with an insulin secretagogue or insulin, hypoglycemia may occur.  
**  
Common adverse effects:  
**Discomfort  
Nausea  
Flatulence  
Vomiting  
Diarrhea, drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, malaise, and headache may also occur.  
  
Another rare adverse effect of metformin is megaloblastic anemia due to the impaired absorption of vitamin B12.  
This can be prevented by the administration of vitamin B12.  
  
**Warning: Metformin-associated lactic acidosis has resulted:  
**Hypothermia  
Hypotension  
Resistant bradyarrhythmias  
Death  
**  
Metformin-associated lactic acidosis  
Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is characterized by:  
**When Metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL.  
Elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L).  
Anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia).  
Increased lactate to pyruvate ratio.  
The incidence of Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is 0.03 per 1000 patient years, but, mortality can be as high as 50% \[Bailey and Turner 1996\].**  
  
How renal insufficiency may cause Metformin-associated lactic acidosis  
**_The risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis depends on the degree of impairment of renal function._90% of metformin is excreted by the kidney.  
Renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion will cause an accumulation of Metformin.  
An accumulation of Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, thereby increasing lactate blood levels, and resulting in higher cellular lactate levels.  
Intracellular redox potential then shifts from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism.  
A decrease in pyruvate carboxylase activity, the rate-limiting enzyme in the formation of glucose from lactate, can also decrease hepatic metabolism of lactate.  
**  
Risk factors for Metformin-associated lactic acidosis:  
**Renal impairment  
Concomitant use of certain drugs: (eg, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate).  
≥65 years  
Having a radiological study with IV contrast.  
Extensive surgery  
Hypoxic states (eg, acute congestive heart failure)  
Excessive alcohol intake  
Hepatic impairment  
**The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle.**  
**  
Possible nonspecific symptoms:**  
Malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain.  
If Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue metformin and initiate treatment for lactic acidosis.  
Management of metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA):  
  
**MALA is controversial.  
Treatment may include:  
**Supportive care, normalizing the acid-base imbalance.  
Activated charcoal for metformin overdose.  
Bicarbonate infusion to correct blood pH.  
Hemodialysis, or continuous veno-venous hemofiltration have been successfully utilized to reduce metformin serum levels.  
  
**Absorption and Bioavailability:** Maximum plasma metformin concentration (Tmax) is achieved in 7-8 hours.  
**Distribution:** Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins.  
Steady state plasma concentrations are reached within 24-48 hours and are generally < 1 μg/mL.  
Metformin also partitions into erythrocytes.  
**Metabolism and excretion:** Following oral administration, 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours.  
In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.  
**Half-life:** 6.2 hours in the plasma, and in the blood. The elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.  
**Route of elimination:** Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does NOT undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans), nor biliary excretion.**Clearance:** Renal tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination.  
**Contraindications of Metformin  
According to the recommendations from Bristol Squib, Metformin should be excluded in Type 2 DM when:**  
**Renal impairment:** Cr ≥ 1.5 mg/dL in men, and ≥1.4 mg/dL in women.  
**Cardiac or respiratory insufficiently:** That is likely to cause a reduced peripheral perfusion or central hypoxia.  
**  
History of lactic acidosis**  
**Patients older than 80 years:** Unless renal function is uncompromised.  
**Severe infection:** May have decreased tissue perfusion.  
**Liver disease:** Including alcoholic liver disease.  
**Sepsis  
Dehydration  
  
Intravenous contrast can cause an acute alteration of renal function.  
**Patients with diabetes are prone to contrast-induced nephropathy.  
Radiological procedures involving the IV contrast media, can lead to acute alteration of renal function, or failure with subsequent lactic acidosis in patients taking Metformin \[Jamet et al. 1980; Klow et al. 2001; McCartney et al. 1999\].  
  
Most radiological services recommend routine omission of Metformin for 24 hours prior to the procedure, and the withholding of Metformin for 48 hours afterwards.  
Prolonged cessation of Metformin may cause hyperglycemia. An alternative anti-hyperglycemic treatment will be required. Short-term insulin therapy is strongly advised.  
Following the procedure, the patient’s serum creatinine level should be shown to not have increased significantly before Metformin is resumed.  
  
**CHF and Metformin-associated lactic acidosis  
**Patients with unstable or acute CHF, cardiovascular collapse (shock) acute MI, and other conditions characterized by hypoxemia are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. These patients also have increased risk of lactic acidosis.  
The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient’s age.  
**  
Extensive surgery and Metformin-associated lactic acidosis  
**A decrease in renal perfusion will decrease the renal excretion rate of metformin, resulting in higher plasma levels. Elevated plasma levels of metformin may cause metformin-associated lactic acidosis.  
**  
Events during extensive surgery that may decrease renal perfusion:  
**Hypotension secondary to blood loss.  
Hypotension secondary to anesthesia.  
Myocardial ischemia  
Sepsis  
**  
The other reason why Metformin is NOT taken the day of extensive surgery  
**Hypoglycemia from an increase in insulin release during surgical stress while Metformin is still present (metformin works over a period of 12 hours).  

Should dialysis be offered in all cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis?
