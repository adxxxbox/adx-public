Bipolar Hemiarthroplasty of the Hip     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Bipolar Hemiarthroplasty of the Hip

These patients are usually very old. Prepare a Neosynephrine drip.

  
Similar to a total hip replacement but only one half of the hip joint is replaced. It may be required if the neck of the femur has been fractured, particularly if the break is close to the hip joint. The hip socket or acetabulum is usually not injured. If the cartilage of the hip socket is in good health, the metal ball of the hemiarthroplasty can glide against the cartilage without damaging the surface.  
This procedure drastically shortens the hospitalization and has been successful in the relief of hip pain and in increasing hip motion. This surgery is more extensive, but the patient can bear weight immediately.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT.  
Sometimes these patients are too sore to be moved, so it is common to intubate them on the bed they arrive in. Then the staff can carefully slide them over on the OR table.  
**Regional:** Spinal or epidural is optional with a low-dose Propofol infusion.  
**Position**: Lateral Decubitus. The surgical incision is either anterior or posterior.

**Methyl methacrylate:** Yes, it will most likely be used, so be alert for increased risk for venous or fat emboli and hemodynamic instability.

**Duration:** 1.5-3 hours.  
**IV Access:** 18G  
**Neo Drip:** Usually, due to advanced age.  
**EBL:** 200-500mL

**Possible Complications**

Thigh pain.  
Iatrogenic fracture of proximal femur.  
Hip dislocations.  
Delayed union of fractures.  
Superficial infection.  
DVT  
Pulmonary Emboli.

**Other Notes**  
In a total hip replacement, the surgeon replaces both the ball and the socket.
