### Hyperthermic Intra-Peritoneal Chemotherapy or "HIPEC"

  
**_Edited by Ashley Hussey, CRNA-Clinical Instructor at Wake Forest Baptist Health, Winston Salem, NC_**

**Short summary of the surgical procedure**:  
These cases are usually very long and extensive. It is done for carcinomatosis of the abdominal contents. Typically, the primary cancer is located in the colon, ovaries, appendix, or other abdominal organ and then metastasizes to the peritoneum (the thin layer that covers abdominal organs and surrounds the abdominal cavity). The majority of cases will start with urology placing bilateral double J ureteral stents, which mark the ureters (so they do not accidentally get nipped), and facilitates upper urinary tract drainage. Make sure you mark right stent, foley, and left stent on the drainage device bags. After the stents are placed, the primary surgeon will debulk the large tumors and strip the peritoneum and sometimes the diaphragm (if it is involved). After debulking is completed the surgeon will place 4 ports (one in each abdominal quadrant) and temporarily close the abdomen with interrupted sutures. The 4 ports will be connected to a system set up by a perfusionist and they will be used to infuse and remove the heated chemotherapeutic agent. During infusion of the heated chemo into the abdomen, which normally lasts 2 hours, you should watch the patient's temperature and draw serial arterial blood gases. Typically antibiotics are not re-dosed during the chemo infusion (either re-dose slightly early or after infusion of chemo agent has stopped).

**Short summary describing the anesthesia:** The debulking process is typically very long, especially if the cancer is extensive. Large fluid shifts and electrolyte imbalances occur during this period. A large drop in temperature will occur, as the abdomen is open. Do interval ABGs to determine electrolyte and fluid/blood product replacement needs.

**Indications of the procedure:**  
**_Advanced peritoneal carcinomatosis_**

**Pre-op and what to prepare. What you need to find out?**  
Thorough preoperative evaluation. Make sure to note heart and lung sounds.

**Anesthetic:** General with ETT  
**Airway issues:** Swelling with large volume load required during case. Patients are assessed for extubation, but some go to the ICU intubated until hemodynamics prove stable due to the large amount of fluid replacement during the case.

**Regional-Caudal:** A thoracic epidural is recommended for post of pain control.

**Induction:** Standard induction unless patient history denotes need for something different.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Full paralysis

**Position**: Supine. After the heated chemotherapy is introduced into the abdomen the patient is rocked back and forth on the OR table for approximately 2 hours to facilitate coating of all abdominal contents with the heated chemotherapeutic agent

**Duration:** 8-12 hours **-** may be much longer  
**EBL:** Surgeon dependent, but usually 450-2000 mLs  
**IV Access:** 2-3 large bore PIVs, but a central line is used in some institutions.

**Extras:** Esophageal temperature probe or temperature sensing foley, upper body forced air warmer, and fluid warmer.

-   \*\*Remember to turn off all warmers prior to initiation of the hyperthermic chemotherapeutic agent (and document this!). A cooling blanket should be under the patient and turned on during the heated chemo portion.

**A-line:** recommended due to large fluid shifts and need for interval ABGs

**Age Range:** 35-75, but HIPECs have been done on pediatric patients as well

**Foley Catheter:** yes, plus bilateral double J ureteral stents.**Hydration:** Typically NS or plasmalyte. LR is normally avoided in these patients due to the risk of metabolic acidosis and elevated serum lactate levels during the case. Colloid (Albumin) use is also encouraged to limit the amount of crytalloid use. Blood loss can be great and should be replaced accordingly. Large amounts of crystalloids can hemodilute, which necessitates the replacement of platelets and clotting factors. TEGs (Thromboelastograms) are used at some institutions to assist in determining which blood products need replacement. NO HESPAN OR HEXTEND.

**Emergence:** Smooth emergence due to large abdominal incision. May be unable to extubate due to large fluid requirements.

**More Notes:**  
Ask the surgeon whether they would like a dobhoff (small bore feeding tube placed transpyloric - the surgeon may manipulate the dobhoff transpyloric) or NGT—Some surgeons like for both to be placed and left in place post surgery. The patient will need around 2 weeks of enteric feeds or TPN (surgeon preference) while the GI system heals.
