### Respiratory Effects with Neuraxial Anesthesia

Neuraxial blockade plays a very minor role in altering pulmonary function. Even with high thoracic levels of blockade, tidal volume is unchanged.  
There is a slight decrease in vital capacity as a result of relaxation of the abdominal muscles during exhalation.  
  
**Phrenic Nerve-Hard to Block**  
The phrenic nerve is innervated by C3-C5 and is responsible for the diaphragm. The phrenic nerve is extremely difficult to block, even with a high spinal. In fact, apnea associated with a high spinal is thought to be related to brainstem hypoperfusion and NOT blockade of the phrenic nerve. This is based on the fact that spontaneous respiration resumes after hemodynamic resuscitation has occurred.  
  
**Patients with COPD  
**COPD patients often depend on intercostal and abdominal muscles to aid their inspiration and exhalation. Neuraxial blockade may reduce the function of these muscles, having a detrimental impact on the patient’s ability to breathe, as well as affect the ability to clear secretions and cough.  
  
For procedures above the umbilicus, a pure regional anesthetic may not be beneficial for the patient with COPD. However, postoperative analgesia with thoracic epidurals has been found to be helpful to the patient with severe lung disease undergoing a thoracic or abdominal procedure.  
  
**Thoracic Epidurals**  
Thoracic and abdominal surgical procedures are associated with decreased phrenic nerve activity resulting in decreased diaphragmatic function and FRC (functional reserve capacity). This can lead to atelectasis and hypoxia due to a V/Q mismatch.

Thoracic epidural analgesia has been found to:**  
Decrease the incidence of pneumonia  
Decrease respiratory failure  
Improve oxygenation  
Decrease the amount of time that the patient may require for postoperative ventilation.
