Ketamine Enantiomers (S and R-Ketamine)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Ketamine Enantiomers (S and R-Ketamine)

**It has several commercial trade names, including:**  
Ketalar®  
Ketaject®  
Ketaset®  
Vetalar®  
  
A bottle of generic ketamine (racemic ketamine) used in medical facilities is a racemic mixture composed of equal amounts of two enantiomers (isomers), S and R.

**The two enantiomers of racemic ketamine:**  
S-ketamine (eskatamine) is the left-handed orientation of the molecule.  
R-ketamine (arketamine) is the right-handed version.  
  
When these two enantiomers are separated, they have similar pharmacokinetics but different potencies.  
  
**S-ketamine is more potent than R-ketamine:  
**S ketamine has a fourfold greater affinity for the NMDA receptor and greater anesthetic potency than R-ketamine.  
\- S-ketamine binds more potently to the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor than R-ketamine.  
\- S-ketamine induces less drowsiness, less lethargy, and impairment in clustered subjective cognitive capacity than equianalgesic small-dose of racemic ketamine.  
\- In humans, intravenous S-ketamine (0.15 mg/kg) is more potent than R-ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) as an analgesic.  
\- S-ketamine also produces 1.6 times greater altered body image and changes in hearing.  
\- It has 2.5 times greater feelings of unreality and four times more reduced visual acuity.  
\- S-ketamine also has a more reduction in pain scores than patients given R-ketamine.  
\- S-ketamine appears to have greater unwanted psychic side effects than the R-enantiomers).  
\- S ketamine causes fewer psychotic emergent reactions, less agitated behavior, and better intraoperative amnesia and analgesia than its R (–) enantiomer  
\- S (+)-Ketamine is available (Ketanesth ® ) in some European countries (Germany, Austria, Italy, and the Netherlands).  
\- The S (+)-ketamine (“S”) spatial structure, light diverged to the right), is two times stronger than the racemic form and four times than the R (−)-ketamine isomer.  
  
**R-ketamine is a more potent antidepressant.  
**In animal studies, R ketamine was a potent, long-lasting, and safe antidepressant free of psychotomimetic side effects.  
R-ketamine is superior in inducing synaptogenesis, which is the formation of new connections between brain cells.  
_Despite the literature above concerning the superiority of R-ketamine for depression, it is an S-ketamine spray currently used for depression.  
  
_Jansen pharmaceutical (a subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson) found a way to isolate just S-ketamine by filtering the racemic molecule and discarding the R-enantiomer.  
The left-handed solution (S-ketamine) is the only ketamine formulation currently approved by the FDA to treat treatment-resistant depression.  
**Nasal spray for MDD:**  
SPRAVATO® (esketamine) is the first and only NMDA receptor antagonist approved for two subtypes of MMDD in adult patients.  
It was FDA approved on May 5. 2019.  
  
**Indications for SPRAVATO ® (esketamine) CIII Nasal Spray:**  
In conjunction with an oral antidepressant, treatment of resistant depression (TRD) in adults and depressive symptoms in adults with MDD with acute suicidal ideation or behavior.
