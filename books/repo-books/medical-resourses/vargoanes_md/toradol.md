Toradol (Ketorolac Tromethamine)

**Class:** NSAID  
Exhibits potent analgesic effects but only moderate anti-inflammatory activity.  
Inhibits BOTH COX-1 and COX-2 (NONselective).  
More surgeons now prefer Ofirmev (Tylenol) drip over Toradol.  
20x cheaper than it's only IV NSAID competitor Caldolor.  
**Standard Dose**  
30mg for patients < 65yo with normal kidney function.  
15mg for > 65yo with normal kidney function.  
If CR >1, avoid Toradol.  
**IM:** up to 60mg  
**IV onset:** Peaks in 10 mins  
**IM onset:** Peaks 45-60 mins  
**Duration:** up to 4 hours  
**Elimination:** Kidneys  
**Narcotic Equivalence:**10mg Morphine or 100mg Demerol  
**Respiratory or CV depression:** No  
**Increase Bleeding Time:** Conflicting literature  
**Decreases Renal Prostaglandins:** Yes  
It potentiates the antinociceptive actions of opioids.  
Has a ceiling effect with post op analgesia.  
**Toradol Facts**  
Post op nurses love it when you give Toradol.  
Patients require less post op narcotics when given Toradol.  
Has little to no effect on the biliary tract dynamics.  
**Avoid with:** Asthma  
Nasal polyps  
Rhinitis  
Cox Allergies  
**Toradol increases bleeding time**  
Toradol may increase bleeding time and decreased platelet aggregation until it is eliminated. This is why we ASK the surgeon First at the end of the case if they want Toradol. Many hate it and some blame Toradol for past post op bleeds.  
**Renal Function**  
Toradol decreases prostaglandins, and we know that prostaglandins prevent renal arteriole constriction which decreases renal blood flow. If a patient's renal function does not depend on renal prostaglandins and they are adequately hydrated, it should not be an issue. Hypovolemic patients should not get Toradol.  
However, most anesthesia providers avoid it if the CR >1.  
There have been reports of acute renal failure, nephritis and nephrotic syndrome.  
**Dialysis Patients**  
These patients have End Stage Renal Disease. Their kidneys are already ruined. I have seen Toradol given under the rationale that it does not matter at this point.  
They are going to get dialysis either way  
**Life threatening bronchospasms**  
It is documented that severe bronchospasms can occur with Toradol to patients with nasal polyposis, asthma and aspirin sensitivity.  
If the patient is allergic to aspirin, you can ask them if they have ever taken Ibuprofen etc.  
There is a debate on stomach irritation with NSAIDs. PO NSAIDs may irritate the stomach lining. IV should not, yet some still avoid giving it.  
**Elimination**  
Kidneys: patients with reduced creatinine clearance, will result in diminished clearance of the drug.  
**Method of Action**  
Normal functions of Cyclooxygenase (COX)  
COX is found in all tissues and helps regulate multiple processes.  
**1.** Tissue injury: promotes inflammation and sensitize receptors to painful stimuli.  
**2.** In stomach, protect the gastric mucosa by promoting synthesis of prostaglandins.  
**3.** In platelets, synthesis of thromboxane which stimulates platelet aggregation.  
**4.** In kidneys, promotes vasodilation and renal perfusion.  
**5.** In brain, mediate fever and contribute to perception of pain.  
**6.** In uterus, promote contraction at term.  
Cyclooxygenase (COX) is an enzyme that converts arachodonic acid to prostaglandin H2, which is responsible for the formation of prostanoids.  
The three main groups of prostanoids - prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and thromboxanes.  
We are concerned with COX-1 and COX-2  
Inhibiting COX-2 is good because COX-2 contributes to inflammation, pain and fever.  
Inhibiting COX-1 is bad because it can contribute to gastric erosion and ulceration, bleeding tendencies and renal impairment.  
The decrease in Thromboxane (TXA2) contributes to the decrease in platelet aggregation (increasing bleeding time)  
Celebrex is a SELECTIVE COX-2 Inhibitor. Too bad it is not in the IV form.
