The reimplantation of one, or both, of the ureters into a different a part of the bladder to treat vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).  
VUR is one of the most common abnormalities of the urinary tract in children and is present in 25-50% of those who have urinary tract infections (UTI). VUR spontaneously resolves in most children.**  
  
Indications for surgery:  
**VUR associated with congenital anomalies at the uteropelvic junction (UPJ)  
High grade VUR (4 and 5)

Breakthrough urinary tract infection (UTI) despite antibiotics  
Renal growth retardation  
Non-resolution over 3 years  
Renal scan abnormality  
Parent/surgeon preference.

**_VUR if left untreated, could result in renal scarring, hypertension, pyonephrosis and end-stage kidney failure._**

**Surgical Procedure (open, laparoscopic or robotic)  
Ureters may be approached via:  
**Intravesically - within the bladder  
Extravesically - outside the bladder

Combined  
An incision is made in the lower abdomen, just above the pubic bone. For a laparoscopic or robotic approach multiple small incisions are made.  
The end of the ureter and some associated muscle near it are detached from the bladder.  
The surgeon will decide where in the bladder to reimplant the detached ureter.  
A tunnel within the bladder wall for the ureter to be placed inside.

The ureter is moved to the new site within the bladder and inserted into the tunnel.

This, in turn, corrects the deficient valve that was allowing urine to reflux.

Once the ureter is in place, it is sutured.

If the other ureter is also being corrected, it is also done at this time.  
The bladder is sutured closed.

The abdominal incision is then also closed.

A small drainage tube may also be placed near the incision.  
This surgery is very successful with a 95-98% success rate.

**Common Pre-op Diagnosis**  
VUR  
Obstructive megaureter - expanded or widened ureter that does not function normally.  
Ureterocele - cystic out-pouching of the distal ureter into the urinary bladder.

**Anesthesia:** General/ETT  
Combined caudal is common for the little patients.

**Narcotics:** May not need when a caudal is done.

**Muscle relaxation:** Usually

**Position:** Supine and arms to the side. Sometimes the patient is usually pulled down towards the foot of the bed. Make sure you have appropriate tubing extensions and always/continually protect the airway (i.e. if/when docking/undocking the robot, etc.).  
**Room Temp:** Warmed and underbody warmer.  
**EBL:** minimal  
**IV Access:** Some literature states 2. 1 good flowing IV is popular.

**Hydration: 4:2:1 (below is just a common reference)  
**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**Duration:** 2-3 hours, but may take longer if there are duplicated ureters, or if tapering (made smaller where it enters the bladder) of the ureter is needed. A ureter may need to be tapered if it is a megaureter.  
  
**Age range:** 1 month to teenage  
**Male : Female:** 1:4  
**Foley:** yes

Post op bladder spasms: Common, consider a B&O suppository or one of the anticholinergics.

**Possible Complications  
**Bleeding  
Infection  
Ureteral obstruction  
Decreased UO (<1 mL/kg/hr)-most common cause is mild ureteral Obstruction secondary to transient edema at the UVJ (Ureterolvesical  
Junction)- portion where the ureter meets the bladder.  
Profound oliguria and anuria-rare  
Hydronephrosis \- dilation of the kidney  
Hydroureteronephrosis or urinary extravasation

**More Notes  
**Some urologists prefer to initially use an endoscopic tissue-augmenting material injection procedure for the correction of VUR.

Subureteral injection of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer (Deflux) material has been used. However, endoscopic treatment has a lower success rate and a higher recurrence than open ureteral reimplantation surgery.

The ureter isn’t completely developed. This can cause retrograde urine flow from the bladder back up into the kidney (VUR). VUR is painless. But it does increase the occurrence of UTI’s

**How VUR is diagnosed**

Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) is used to confirm the diagnosis of VUR. During a VCUG a thin plastic tube (catheter) is inserted into the urethra (opening where urine comes out). The bladder is then filled with a contrast solution. While the bladder is being filled, X-ray pictures are taken to see if any of the contrast is traveling up the ureters. Children are asked to urinate once the bladder is full to see if any reflux occurs during the voiding phase. The VCUG takes 15-20 minutes.

About 30% of children who have a UTI with a fever will be diagnosed with VUR. Due to the increased use of prenatal ultrasounds, hydronephrosis (dilation of the kidneys) can be detected before birth. There are many reasons why a child’s kidneys may show dilation. If the degree of dilation is significant enough, a VCUG is recommended is recommend to check for reflux.

About 1 percent of healthy children have reflux; many will never have an infection or need treatment.

VUR does not cause a urinary tract infection. VUR allows bacteria that may be in the bladder to travel with the refluxing urine retrograde into the kidney. This bacteria, in turn, can then cause a kidney infection.

In some children, once they have a kidney infection, “scarring” to the kidney can occur. Kidney scarring may lead to high blood pressure. If both kidneys are scarred, kidney function may decrease. Pregnant women who have had significant kidney damage have an increased risk of complications.

**Endoscopic surgery**  
This is usually an outpatient procedure under general anesthesia. A cystoscope is inserted and utilized to inject a substance called Deflux into the area where the ureter enters the bladder. Deflux helps prevent urine from flowing back into the ureter.

Most doctors will try and wait until the child is 18 months old if possible. There have been studies showing that the surgery has a higher success rate after the age of 12 months, but if there are multiple recurrent infections, aggressive measures may be needed.

It is common for children to experience bladder spasms after surgery. The urologist usually prescribes Ditropan PO to help control them.
