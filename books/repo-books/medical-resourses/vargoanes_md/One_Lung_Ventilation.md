### One Lung Ventilation (OLV) with VATS and Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction (HPV)

-   Anesthesia providers should be aware of the effects of anesthesia on the Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction (HPV) reflex to preserve V/Q matching during thoracic surgeries that involve a collapsed lung.
-   For a VATS procedure, a lung will be deliberately collapsed to create an open area in the pleural cavity to enhance the visualization and space for the surgeon to operate.
-   To collapse a lung, a double lumen tube (DLT) or bronchial blocker is properly inserted to stop ventilation to the targeted lung, while the other lung will be fully ventilated.
-   Initially, unoxygenated blood will be delivered to the collapsed lung and remain unoxygenated as it returns to the left heart.
-   This is also known as a physiologic shunt.
-   This creates a ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, resulting in less oxygenated blood delivered to the body.
-   The HPV reflex is activated to shunt the unoxygenated blood away from the collapsed lung so it could be oxygenated by the ventilated lung.
-   This will decrease the V/Q mismatch and improve oxygenation throughout the body.

**HPV Reflex Review**

-   The systemic circulation dilates in the presence of hypoxia, in contrast to the pulmonary circulation, which vasoconstricts.
-   This response of the pulmonary circulation is known as HPV and is a protective physiological reflex that aims to divert blood flow away from hypoxic areas of the of the lungs to areas with better ventilation and oxygenation.
-   In other words, if an area of the lung is not being ventilated (a shunt), why waste the delivery (perfusion) of unoxygenated blood to that affected area where it will not become oxygenated.
-   With a VATS procedure, the HPV reflex will force unoxygenated blood away from the entire collapsed lung and deliver it to the ventilated lung.
-   This reflex attempts to optimize oxygen delivery and to enhance and the overall systemic oxygenation.

**Diseased lungs and HPV:**

-   A patient with lung disease may already be benefiting from HPV.
-   The role of HPV is much more significant in chronic respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and interstitial lung disease.
-   HPV redirects unoxygenated blood away from diseased lung areas to the better-ventilated lung areas, thus improving the V/Q matching.

**HPV occurs in two parts:**

**Initial phase** (within minutes and plateaus by 30 minutes)

**Delayed phase** (starts at ~40 minutes and plateaus after a few hours).

-   Once the delayed phase becomes active, this pulmonary vasoconstriction takes hours to reverse when normoxia returns.
-   This has significant clinical implications for repeated periods of one-lung ventilation.

**Factors that influence/potentiate HPV:**

**Oxygen tension:** Low oxygen tension in the alveoli is the primary stimulus for HPV.

-   CO2 levels and ↓ pH (respiratory acidosis)  
    Metabolic acidosis  
    Mild decreased mixed venous oxygenation
-   Sympathetic nervous system activity will ↑ HPV  
    Mild decreased mixed venous oxygenation  
    Hypothermia (low body temperature) inhibits HPV  
    Hyperthermia enhances it.  
    
-   **Note:**  Hypothermia itself is associated with a significant increase in pulmonary vascular resistance.

Inhibiting HPV can potentially lead to decreased oxygen delivery and worsen gas exchange.

**Agents/factors that decrease PVR inhibiting HPV and may decrease SaO2:**

-   Inhaled Nitric oxide (NO)
-   Nitrous oxide (N₂O)
-   Prostacyclin analogs for PHT
-   Phosphodiester (type 5) inhibitors (Cialis and Viagra) for PHT
-   Calcium channel blockers-Nicardipine, Nifedipine and Diltiazem
-   Nitric oxide donors: Nitroglycerine and Nitroprusside
-   ACE inhibitors
-   Milrinone
-   Increased left atria (LA) pressure -see notes at the bottom of this page
-   Hemodilution (fluid overload- limit fluids)
-   Metabolic and respiratory alkalosis

**Medications that will NOT inhibit HPV:**

Alpha-1 agonist phenylephrine and norepinephrine

**Patients with PHT:**

-   HPV, with PHT patients, can worsen their condition by increasing pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and leading to right ventricular dysfunction
-   A balance must be struck to inhibit HPV, dilating the pulmonary artery, with the need to maintain systemic blood pressure to sustain coronary artery perfusion pressure.
-   Some have advocated infusing vasopressin or norepinephrine when infusing milrinone to achieve this.

**Additional considerations:**

**HPV may also occur during the following surgical procedures:**

-   Robotic prostatectomy, hysterectomy,or other procedures that require a pneumoperitoneum and steep Trendelenburg.
-   The surgical criteria above result in elevated peak inspiratory pressures (PIP), which require Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV) with lower-than-normal tidal volumes.  
    
-   _Refer to “Trendelenburg and Steep Trendelenburg” in the Vargo Coexisting & Surgery App for details._
-   **Atrial Fibrillation Ablation**procedures when minimal cardiac and pulmonary movement is recommended during the mapping of the heart.
-   Very low tidal volumes are requested because a fully inflated lung increases cardiac movement.
-   Sedated spontaneously breathing patients, resulting in hypoventilation and atelectasis from reduced tidal volumes.

**Sedated spontaneously breathing patients, resulting in hypoventilation and atelectasis from reduced tidal volumes.**

-   LA pressure represents the pressure in the left atrium of the heart, which is a chamber that receives oxygenated blood from the lungs.
-   Elevated LA pressure, often seen in heart failure or pulmonary hypertension, can affect pulmonary circulation.

**Inhibition of HPV:**

-   Increased LA pressure can interfere with the natural constriction of pulmonary vessels during hypoxia for the following reasons:

1.  **Pressure-induced vasodilation:** High left atrial (LA) pressure can potentially cause the pulmonary vessels to dilate rather than constrict, effectively counteracting the HPV response.
2.  **Reduced flow diversion:** Increased LA pressure can reduce the pressure gradient between the pulmonary arteries and the pulmonary veins, leading to less blood flow diversion away from hypoxic areas.
