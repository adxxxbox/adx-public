### Prostatectomy-Nerve Sparing

**Nerve-sparing Prostatectomy:** During a Prostatectomy, the surgeon attempts to spare the posterolateral neurovascular bundles which supply the cavernosa nerves of the penis which controls erection. These nerves run next to the prostate and may be destroyed during surgery, leading to impotence.  
  
Failure to preserve the nerves may lead to impotency.
