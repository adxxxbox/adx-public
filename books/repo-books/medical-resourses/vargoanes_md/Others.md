### What Others Like Coming Off Pump

**Dr. Robert Mingus, Chattanooga, TN**  
Most patients coming off of CPB will not need an inotrope if cardiac function is normal to start with, bypass time is under 2 hours and heart protection is adequate. For those needing assistance I find a small dose of ephedrine (2.5 to 5 mg) is often all that is needed for a "jumpstart " off CPB. I will add a beta agonist bolus and infusion 10 minutes prior to separation for those patients suspected of having cardiac dysfunction. All of the beta agonists have their merits: my favorite is epinephrine. For severe dysfunction I will add milrinone, bolusing 50ug/kg 10 minutes prior to separation and beginning a 0.5ug/kg /min infusion along with a norepinephrine infusion. The synergy of a beta agonist with phosphodiesterase inhibitor can be profound and the alpha agonist properties of norepinephrine can be useful to balance the vasodilation effects of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Although sometimes necessary, I try to avoid the use of vasopressin as this drug has many side effects including bowel ischemia. I also encourage the surgeon to place a femoral arterial line pre-CPB if severe cardiac dysfunction is suspected (e.g. mitral valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting with low ejection fraction. ) Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation is an excellent complement to maximum inotrope therapy.  
  
Since calcium chloride is known to contribute to reperfusion injury in the separation period, I administer it only when I can document or strongly suspect a low ionized Ca++ level.

First of all, around 80% of our hearts are now off pump. So I will write about the remaining 20%.  
  
My favorite for coming off pump is use nothing at all! However, we all know we may only see that with young healthy hearts with EF’s around 50% without a prolonged bypass time.  
  
As we all know that everything is situational and varies from patient to patient. In addition, many surgeons have their favorite drips, so you might be limited on a favorite cocktail.  
  
Here is what I do or have seen where I work:  
Some surgeons still like us to use dobutamine or dopamine. So we use them with a phenylephrine drip until we catch up giving the volume while coming off bypass.  
  
“Jumpstarting” the heart: we dilute a syringe of epinephrine to 1mcg/mL and give 1-3 mcg of epinephrine (one mcg at a time) a little bit after the cross clamp is off and the perfusionist is lowering his flow rates as we are coming off bypass.  
  
Though this is not a drip, we give a little bit of NTG to vasodilate the patient while the perfusionist gives 100ml boluses through the aortic cannula per surgeons’ request before the aortic cannula is removed. A few boluses can increase the BP.  
  
Over all, we don’t use as much dopamine or dobutamine anymore.  
Milrinone is a great inotrope especially if it’s a valve with pulmonary hypertension.  
  
A combination of milrinone and phenylephrine is a common cocktail. Once you catch the patient up with the post pump volume of hetastarch, cell saver etc, the neo drip is usually weaned first and then the milrinone is weaned.  
  
Vasoconstrictors: we may not use Levophed as much as others. We still try to stick with phenylephrine.  
  
Really sick heart: Epinephrine infusion with the intra-aortic baloom pump (IABP).  
  
If they came over from the cath lab with an IABP and drips, sometimes we go straight to an epinephrine drip.

When I use milrinone and give the suggested bolus of 50mcg/kg over 10 minutes, I find that the basic supportive phenylephrine drip is not strong enough to counter the vasodilation effects of milrinone. I just start with a low dose of Levophed and titrate to effect.  
  
If I don’t give the Milrinone bolus, then I use phenylephrine.  
  
Sometimes I use dobutamine and phenylephrine instead of milrinone. However, dobutamine tends to cause tachycardia which we want to avoid.  
  
  
**Dr Adam Evec, Spartanburg, SC**  
If a very healthy patient and bypass less than 2 -3 hours, I try to come off with nothing.  
  
If the heart needs assistance, I like to come off with .05-0.1mcg/kg/min of epinephrine. I start it early to jumpstart the heart when the aortic cross clamp comes off. When the aortic clamp comes off, I know there is an interval of at least 10 minutes between removing the cross clamp and coming off pump. I titrate from there.  
  
CaCl 2 : Just about everybody comes off pump with a below normal ionized Ca. I like to give the first 500mg of CaCl 2 when I give the protamine to counter the hypotensive effects of protamine, and I could titrate the remaining 500mg as needed per labs and BP.  
  
Where I work, the perfusionist gives us the cell saver immediately coming off bypass, so I don’t have to start off with albumin. They give us anywhere between 500-1,000ml. I give an extra 50mg of protamine after the cell saver is in.  
  
Concerning milrinone, I will use it if the patient has pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure or mitral regurgitation.  
  
I never give the initial bolus because it may become a strong vasodilator. I just start it early.  
  
One surgeon I work with will give back almost all of the remaining blood in the pump via aortic cannula 100cc at a time. So, when the patient receives around 700ml, you could expect the pressure to jump. Consider some NTG to counter that or have the patient placed in reverse trendelenburg.  
  
Make a good prediction of Inotropic state. If ejection fraction (EF) and cardiac index (CI) were poor pre CPB, then you pretty much know it won’t be much different coming off.  
  
If the CI and CO was poor pre-op, you will also need an inotrope.  
  
If your inotrope is a phosphodiasterase inhibitor (milrinone), you will also need a constrictor (milrinone also dilates).  
  
If CO and CI were good pre-op, you might just need some phenylephrine.

I typically use calcium, some light phenylephrine and volume from the pump, cell saver, colloids, PRBCs. I really like using milrinone to help with contractility coming off pump. If the patient had high PA pressures pre-op as seen with some valve patients or the heart simply looked weak when we were weaning from pump, then milrinone works well with background phenylephrine to counteract the vasodilation that milrinone causes, and sometimes Levophed is also required if milrinone and phenylephrine can't cut it. Some people like using dobutamine, but the tachycardia it can cause has been problematic in my experience. Also, what I consider important (and that we have no control over) is giving the heart time to "work", beat, and re-perfuse before coming off pump. So once the bypasses and/or valve repair is complete, the patient is warm, ventilating the lungs, heart beating (either intrinsically or paced), and still on CPB support, the surgeon can give the heart time to re-perfuse before coming completely off pump. This time can really help the heart improve.  
  
The other thing to note is strict blood pressure control when coming off pump. Obviously, you don't want hypotension, but hypertension is also undesirable. Ideal SBP 90-110. So, it is always best to use vasoactives and calcium cautiously and in small doses.
