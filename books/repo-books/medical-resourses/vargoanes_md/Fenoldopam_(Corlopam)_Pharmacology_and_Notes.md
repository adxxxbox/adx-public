# Fenoldopam (Corlopam) Pharmacology and Notes

**Mechanism of Action**

No longer available in the US.

Rapid-acting vasodilator. It is an agonist for D1-like dopamine receptors and binds with moderate affinity to a2-Receptors.

Vasodilaties renal efferent and afferent arterioles increasing renal blood flow thus increasing urine output. 6 times as potent as dopamine in producing renal vasodilation.

**Onset**: 10 minutes Vasodilaties renal efferent and afferent arterioles, thus increasing urine output.

**INDICATIONS AND USAGE**

Management of severe hypertension when rapid, but quickly reversible, emergency reduction of blood pressure is clinically indicated, including malignant hypertension with deteriorating end-organ function.

**Excretion and Metabolism**

Radiolabeled studies show that about 90% of infused Fenoldopam is eliminated in urine, 10% in feces. Elimination is largely by conjugation, without participation of cytochrome P-450 enzymes.

**Dosage**  
**Adult:** Hypertension: titrate to effect  
**Initial:** 0.03-0.1 mcg/kg/min IV  
Can increase every 15 min by 0.3 to 0.5 mcg/kg/min  
**Max Dose:** 1.6 mcg/kg/min.  
A bolus dose should not be used.  
Tachycardia without further decrease in MAP occurred at dosages greater than 0.8 mcg/kg/min.  
Blood pressure and heart rate should return to near baseline within 30 minutes.

Fenoldopam infusion can be abruptly discontinued or gradually tapered prior to discontinuation.
