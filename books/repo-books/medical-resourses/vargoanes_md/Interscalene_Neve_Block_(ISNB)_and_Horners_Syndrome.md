### Interscalene Neve Block (ISNB) and Horner's Syndrome

**Horner Syndrome (HS)**  
**Also called:  
**Horner’s Syndrome  
Oculosympathetic Paresis  
Bernard-Horner Syndrome  
  
\- HS results from paralysis of the ipsilateral sympathetic cervical chain (stellate ganglion).  
  
**Layman’s term:** It results from an interruption of the sympathetic nerve supply to the eye  
  
\- This results from the spread of the local anesthetic around the anterior scalene muscle behind the carotid artery and internal jugular vein toward the longus colli muscle.  
\- This results in block of the cervical ganglion (Horner syndrome) and phrenic nerve located in this area.  
\- HS is a common sequela of the more proximal approaches to brachial plexus blocks.  
  
**These blocks are:**  
Interscalene nerve block  
Supraclavicular nerve block  
  
**How a nerve block causes HS:**  
\- An interruption of the sympathetic outflow to the ipsilateral head and neck from the diffusion of the local anesthetic in the prevertebral spaces.  
**Occurrence of HS with a brachial plexus nerve block:** 20% to 90%  
**The onset of symptoms:** < 45 minutes  
**Duration:** 2 hours  
  
**HS is characterized by the following:**  
**Miosis:** Small or constricted pupil(s)  
**Ptosis:** Upper eyelid droops over the eye)  
**Anhidrosis:** Sweat glands make little or no sweat  
**Enophthalmos:** Sinking of the eyeball within the orbit  
**Conjunctival injection:** Bloodshot eye  
**Nasal congestion  
**Possible shortness of breath due to phrenic nerve paralysis resulting in hemidiaphragmatic paralysis.  
  
**Textbook refers to the classic HS triad:  
**Miosis (ie, constricted pupil)  
Partial ptosis  
Anhidrosis (loss of hemifacial sweating)  
As well as enophthalmos  
**  
The clinical consequences of HS:  
**\- Horner syndrome usually has no clinical consequences in healthy patients.  
\- However, HS may sometimes feel like an unpleasant side effect.\- It has the potential to lead to patient anxiety, discomfort, and dissatisfaction.  
\- For this reason, anesthesia providers should warn the patient that these potential side effects are only temporary.  
**Other possible causes of HS: (not nerve block related)  
**\- Carotid artery dissection  
\- Tumor in the neck or chest cavity  
\- Neuroblastoma and a tumor of the upper part of the lung (Pancoast tumor)  
\- A lesion in the midbrain, brain stem, upper spinal cord, neck, or eye orbit  
\- Inflammation or growths affecting the lymph nodes of the neck  
\- Trauma to the neck or upper spinal cord  
\- Internal Jugular Vein Catheterization  
\- Carotid artery ischemia  
\- Adie Syndrome: A rare neurological disorder affecting the pupil of the eye.  
\- Wallenberg Syndrome: A rare disorder caused by a blood clot  
\- Some cases of Horner syndrome occur for no other apparent reason or unknown cause (idiopathically).  
  
In other cases, some clinical researchers believe the disorder may be inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait.
