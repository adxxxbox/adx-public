### CSE Catheter Test Dosing

  
CSE:(Combined Spinal Epidural)  
**_By Lisa Stiel Moreno, CRNA_**

For CSEs, one must be aware that test dosing the epidural catheter immediately after a spinal dose could be disastrous. A common epidural test dose can lead to a high or total spinal if the catheter was inadvertently inserted into the subarachnoid space.  
  
Some anesthesia providers will test dose the epidural catheter once the spinal has receded an appreciable amount. Every patient's block recedes differently and communication with the patient is important.  
  
If the CSE was performed for a precipitous labor and the spinal dose was a very low dose, then a test dose could either be performed once the block is fully set up or it can be done when you need to use the epidural.

If the CSE was performed for a C-section with a large spinal dose, then it is especially important to wait to test the epidural catheter until the block recedes.  
_It is important to note that you now have an untested epidural placed catheter._

**My Epidural Catheter Test Dose with a CSE:**  
I usually will use 1.5 mLs of 1.5% Lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000.

Resultant dose is lidocaine 22.5mg, epinephrine 7.5 MICROgrams.  
Even that low dose can lead to a high spinal, but placing the patient in reverse Trendelenburg should keep it at manageable levels.

If hypotension is a feature of the high spinal, however, which it usually is, reverse trendelenberg might result in poor cerebral perfusion pressure. Reverse Trendelenburg has multiple hemodynamic consequences in the presence of the sympathectomy of spinal anesthesia.

As with all spinals and epidurals there is a potential for a high block, particularly when you are test dosing the epidural catheter. With the presence of a CSE, you administer a spinal first. We all know that the local anesthetic may migrate from the epidural space to the subarachnoid space via dural puncture site created by the spinal needle. So how soon and how much is it safe to test dose the epidural catheter after the spinal?

The discussion of how to test dose an epidural catheter placed during a CSE has received much debate, and it is highly dependent upon the reason you placed your CSE. This debate centers on when the catheter should be tested. It is not a good idea to test dose the catheter after you gave a spinal dose for a C-section. Already stated above, but obviously deserves the emphasis.

After the spinal solution is administered, the patient's feet should start to feel warm and contractions should begin to feel less painful within a few minutes. Patients might become hypotensive from the rapid and profound pain relief associated with CSE placement, so be ready to treat with ephedrine.  
After the spinal solution is administered with the CSE, it is also important to have the patient lie down soon to prevent a low block that does not cover higher labor pains. This is especially true when the CSE is for a C-section. This means that the epidural catheter must be immediately threaded and secured after the spinal dose to prevent the patient from sitting up to long. This would best be accomplished by using the needle-through-needle technique for CSEA.

There is conflicting literature on how to test dose an epidural catheter placed during a CSE after the spinal dose. It may be highly dependent upon the reason you placed your CSE. This debate centers on when the catheter should be tested.

  
1.

If the CSE was performed for a precipitous labor and the spinal was a very low dose, then a test dose could either be performed once the block is fully set up or it can be done when or if you need to use the catheter. Again, be judicious when deciding the amount for your test dose especially if you are testing it immediately after placement and previous spinal dose.

  
2.

If the CSE was performed for a C-section, then it is prudent to wait to test dose the epidural catheter until you are preparing to use it. Test dosing immediately after the spinal dose can lead to a high or total spinal if the epidural catheter is also intrathecal.  
Despite the risk of an intrathecally placed epidural catheter, there are many experienced anesthesia providers who still test dose the epidural catheter immediately after the spinal dose.

Other providers will NOT test dose the epidural catheter until the spinal has receded down an appreciable amount. This time frame is patient specific, and requires communication with the patient to determine what the baseline sensory block is prior to administering the test.
