### Dantrolene and Ryanodex (concentrated dantrolene)

  
_Edited by Dan Lovinaria, DNP, MS, MBA, APRN, CRNA_

**Dantrolene** is also known as: Dantrium, Dantrium Intravenous , Revonto , Ryanodex.

**Dantrolene (Dantrium, Revonto)-(**36) 20 mg vials-less concentrated**  
Ryanodex (highly concentrated Dantrolene) (**3) 250 mg vials

**Dantrolene (Dantrium, Revonto)  
Class:** Muscle relaxant  
Dantrolene is a direct-acting skeletal muscle relaxant, but it does NOT block neuromuscular transmission nor interfere with reversal of muscle relaxants.

It has no discernible effects on the respiratory or cardiovascular systems.

When given IV to human volunteers, it was associated with loss of grip strength and weakness in the legs, as well as CNS effects, drowsiness and dizziness. CNS effects are unknown.

Dantrolene is a hydrated salt that contains 15% water (3.5 moles) and has a molecular weight of 399. The anhydrous salt (dantrolene) has a molecular weight of 336.

**Indications**  
Treatment of malignant hyperthermia (MH).  
Oral Dantrolene is indicated primarily for the treatment associated with upper motor neuron disorders (_e.g.,_ multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, spinal cord injuries, etc.).  

**How it Works**  
It works by stopping the release of calcium form the sarcoplasm reticulum. This helps  
reestablishing the myoplasmic calcium equilibrium, and increasing the percentage of bound calcium.

**Each 60 mL vial of Dantrolene contains:**

20 mg dantrolene sodium  
3,000 mg Mannitol  
Sodium hydroxide - is to yield a pH of 9.5 when reconstituted with 60 mL sterile water for injection USP (without a bacteriostatic agent).  
Dantrolene is NOT compatible with either normal saline or D5W injection.

**Prophylaxis (Pills) :** Rarely used anymore

**Dantrolene dose for MH crisis  
**2.5 mg/kg IV every 5 minutes, through large bore IV, until symptoms subside.  
May require a total dose up to 30 mg/kg  
Dantrolene vial comes in a lyophilized powder of 20 mg/bottle  
Use a 60 mL syringe and mix with 60 mLs of STERILE WATER  
Dantrolene is NOT compatible with either normal saline or D5W injection.  
  
**Remember:** each 60 mL syringe only contains 20 mg of Dantrolene.**  
  
Ryanodex:** 1 vial contains 250 mg of dantrolene sodium (1 vial per patient).  
It is easy to mix and given with one 5 mL syringe and administered with a single injection.

**Mannitol in Dantrolene  
**Regular Dantrolene contains 3,000 mg Mannitol  
Ryanodex contains only 125 mg mg Mannitol  
(0.0005 grams mannitol/1 mg dantrolene)  
  
**Dantrolene potentiates NMDR drugs - Be careful**  
After administering Dantrolene, the train-of-four (TOF) responses to nerve stimulation will be depressed, with the potentiation of the non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade.

Therefore, be very careful redosing nondepolarizing muscle relaxants and ensure adequate muscle strength has returned prior to extubation.

**How Dantrolene affects patients with pre-existing muscle disease**

Dantrolene may cause significant muscle weakness in patients with pre-existing muscle disease.

**Pharmacokinetics** - The bioavailability of dantrolene after oral administration in humans is only about 35%.  
The drug is fairly slowly absorbed, with peak levels occurring about 5 hours after oral administration. The drug is substantially bound to plasma proteins (principally albumin), but many drugs may displace it from such (see Drug Interactions).

**Dantrolene may cause phlebitis**

Due to the high pH after mixed, Dantrolene burns with IV administration

Dantrolene has been linked to sterile phlebitis following administration to smaller veins.

Always infuse through a large bore IV.

**Treatment for the sterile phlebitis:** warm soaks and elevation.

Care must be taken to prevent extravasation of Dantrolene sodium solution into the surrounding tissues due to the high pH of the intravenous formulation.

**Protein Binding**  
Significant amounts are bound to plasma proteins, mostly albumin, and this binding is readily reversible.

**Drug Interaction**

NEVER administer Calcium channel blockers with Dantrolene  
Calcium channel blockers administered with Dantrolene may produce life-threatening hyperkalemia and myocardial depression.

Clofibrate (cholesterol drug) and Warfarin reduce plasma protein binding of Dantrolene  
Estrogens: May be at increased risk of hepatotoxicity  
Tolbutamide (Diabetic Drug) - increases protein binding

**Contraindications  
**Active hepatic disease - possibly fatal with large PO doses >400-800 mg/day.

**Possible Adverse Reactions  
**Hepatotoxicity is associated with high PO dose chronic therapy, but may also be seen after short high dose therapy.Water intoxication (HYPOnatremia) – mixed with sterile H2O  
Seizures  
Anaphylaxis-only one reported  
Increased urinary frequency  
Hypotension  
Thrombosis

**Drug Interactions**  
Dantrolene may be displaced from plasma proteins by **warfarin** with increased effects or adverse reactions resulting.  
Diazepam, phenytoin or phenylbutazone have NOT been demonstrated to alter the plasma protein binding of dantrolene.

**Overdosage** - There is no specific antidotal therapy to Dantrolene overdoses

**Storage**  
Dantrolene powder for injection should be stored at temperatures less than 30°C and protected from prolonged exposure to light.  
  
After reconstitution, the powder for injection should be used within 6 hours when stored at room temperature and should be protected from direct light.  
  
**pKa:** 7.5

**Chemistry**  
Dantrolene’s hydantoin derivative is NOT similar structurally and pharmacologically from other skeletal muscle relaxant drugs. It occurs as an odorless, tasteless, orange, fine powder that is slightly soluble in water. It rapidly hydrolyzes in aqueous solutions to the free acid form, which precipitates out of solution.

**Elimination**  
The elimination half-life in humans is approximately 8 hours.  
Dantrolene is metabolized in the liver and the metabolites are excreted in the urine.  
Only about 1% of the parent drug is excreted unchanged in the urine and bile.

**Metabolized: By the liver**  
Its major metabolites:  
5-hydroxy dantrolene  
Acetylamino metabolite of dantrolene

**Hydrolysis**  
Dantrolene sodium may also undergo hydrolysis and subsequent oxidation forming nitrophenylfuroic acid.  
**Mean biologic half-life:** with IV administration 4-8 hours.

Dantrolene is a hydrated salt that contains 15% water (3.5 moles) and has a molecular weight of 399. The anhydrous salt (dantrolene) has a molecular weight of 336.

**Contraindications  
**Increased risks of hepatotoxicity from dantrolene have been seen in women >35 years of age who are also receiving **estrogen** therapy.

**Anyone allergic to its contents:  
**Dantrolene sodium  
Mannitol  
Sodium hydroxide

**Pregnancy  
**There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women  
Dantrolene sodium for injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

  
It does cross the placenta and there are side effects in the neonate. It is a risk and would have to be weighed against the expected benefit. The rare possibility of weakness in the neonate must be looked for and treated appropriately.  
  
Vaginal delivery with labor analgesia is perfectly safe for the MH-susceptible patient.

Epidurals are safe for MH affected individuals and safe for the baby as well.

All local anesthetics are safe.  
In one uncontrolled study, 100 mg per day of prophylactic oral dantrolene sodium was administered to term pregnant patients awaiting labor and delivery. Dantrolene readily crossed the placenta, with maternal and fetal whole blood levels approximately equal at delivery; neonatal levels then fell approximately 50% per day for 2 days before declining sharply. No neonatal respiratory and neuromuscular side effects were detected at low dose. More data, at higher doses, are needed before more definitive conclusions can be made.

**Storage**  
Store unreconstituted product at 20-25° C (68-77° F) and avoid prolonged exposure to light. After mixing with sterile water, the powder for injection should be used within 6 hours when stored at room temperature and should be protected from direct light.

**Note:** Because of the expense, minimum order quantity, and non-returnable nature of the commercially available intravenous product, it is not well suited for veterinary use.
