### Anesthesia Tips for Pregnant Patients

Easier IV access.  
Assess airway closely.  
Prepare for a difficult airway, especially in the last trimester.  
Have a Glide Scope available.  
Left tilt 15-30 degrees.  
Preoxygenate at least 3 minutes. A reduced FRC means a poor reserve.  
Always RSI  
Adjuncts for difficult intubation should be available.  
Ventilation should be aimed to keep the PCO2 in the normal range for pregnancy.  
Be prepared for increased peak pressures.  
The MAC of volatile agents is slightly reduced.  
Volatile agents cause relaxation of the uterus (uterine atony) and may result in hemorrhage after delivery of the fetus.  
Larger doses of vasopressors may be needed due to the decreased sensitivity to endogenous and exogenous catecholamines  
Awake extubation is indicated due to high risk of aspiration  
  
The incidence of intraoperative awareness is increased during cesarean section. Consider versed once the baby is out.

Until date, no anesthetic drug has been shown to be clearly dangerous to the human fetus.  
The teratogen must be given in a sufficient dose for a substantial period of time at a critical developmental point to produce the defect.  
  
**Midazolam and pregnancy:**  
Human data regarding the teratogenicity of benzodiazepines are conflicting.  
Most anesthesia providers still avoid a one-time dose of midazolam, especially during early pregnancy.  
Midazolam has less placental transfer than diazepam.  
  
**Nitrous oxide (N2O):** Some literature recommend avoiding nitrous oxide in pregnant women.  
N2O inhibits methionine synthetase, an enzyme necessary for DNA synthesis.
