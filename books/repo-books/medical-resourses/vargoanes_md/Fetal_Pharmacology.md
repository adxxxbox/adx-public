### Local Anesthetics and Fetal Pharmacology

**Concentration of a local anesthetic within the maternal uterine artery depend on:  
**Total dose  
Route of administration  
Epinephrine added?  
Maternal metabolism and excretion  
Maternal protein binding  
Maternal pH and the pKa of the drug  
  
**Concentration of local anesthetic within the fetal umbilical artery depend on:  
**Umbilical vein concentration (input)  
Fetal pH  
Fetal protein binding  
Fetal tissue uptake  
Non-placental elimination (fetal hepatic metabolism and renal excretion).  
  
The transfer of LA from the mother to fetus placenta and in the intervillous space.  
  
It is the unbound (free) drug that crosses the placenta. Unbound local anesthetics can travel either way across the placenta.  
  
LA bound to plasma proteins will not cross the placenta to the fetus.This means the more protein-bound the local anesthetic, the less local anesthetic enters the fetal circulation – like Bupivacaine.  
  
Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) have high affinity with local anesthetics but are small in numbers compared to albumin. AAG will saturate with local anesthetics first.  
Albumin has a low affinity to local anesthetics and is very abundant in numbers.  
  
Fetal blood has 60% the albumin content of maternal plasma  
AAG concentration is 20-30%  
Remaining 10% - various  
  
If a local anesthetic is 75% bound to maternal plasma protein, one out of four molecules are free and can cross the placenta.  
  
If the local anesthetic concentration in fetal blood is 75% of that in maternal blood (i.e., the fetal-maternal drug ratio = 0.75).  
With fetal acidemia, there is more cation trapping thus increasing the ratio.  
  
**When Free Lidocaine Crosses the Placenta  
**When free lidocaine crosses the placenta, it is converted and charged in the acidotic fetus and it can’t back diffuse. The lidocaine becomes trapped in the fetus. When the fetus pH is corrected, the ratio reverses making free lidocaine available to passively diffuse back to the mother down a concentration gradient restoring the lidocaine concentration.  
  
Increased concentrations of a local anesthetic (like given intravascularly) can transfer to the fetus and result is decreased neonatal neuromuscular tone similar to that seen with magnesium.
