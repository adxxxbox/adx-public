### Internal Defibrillator

Internal paddles require much less energy since they are directly in contact with the heart. Usually 10-20 joules is effective.  
  
External cardioversion requires much more energy-50-200 joules.  
  
It is important that the anesthesia provider be familiar with the defibrillator and to check it before a case.
