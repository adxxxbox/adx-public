Asystole    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

## Asystole - Perioperative

Also known “flat line” or “cardiac standstill.”  
A state of no cardiac electrical activity, no contractions of the myocardium and no cardiac output or blood flow (no pulse).

**Heart Monitor Display with Asystole**  
Loss of EKG waveform  
Loss of Pulse oximetry waveform  
Loss of ETCO2 waveform  
  
**When your EKG waveform goes flat**  
_When you see the EKG on your monitor suddenly go flat, **always immediately look at the pulse ox waveform. If the pulse ox waveform is still present**, then you know that a lead must be disconnected._

**_Always check lead placement and a pulse to rule out Asystole  
  
_Transient Asystole  
**_Transient asystole or severe bradycardia followed by a surgeon inducing vagal response is not that uncomomon_

_Always alert the surgeon ASAP with the onset of severe bradycardia or asystole._

During surgery, the surgeon may inadvertently induce a transient asystole. The asystole almost always immediately returns to the previous heart rhythm when the surgeon ceases the stimulation that is inducing the transient asystole.

**Below are several possible causes of severe bradycardia and transient asystole**

**  
Laparoscopy procedures:** During CO2 insufflation and pneumoperitoneum

**Lumbosacral spinal surgery:** From traction on the dura.

**Carotid artery or neck surgery:** Carotid sinus hypersensitivity (CSH)  
**Transsphenoidal and oral surgery**: Trigeminocardiac reflex (TCR)  
**Craniofacial Surgery:** also Trigeminocardiac Reflex (TCR)  
**Simple Extraction of upper molars:** Trigeminocardiac reflex (TCR)

**Eye Surgery:** Oculocardiac Reflex (OCR)  
**After mandibular nerve block:** Maxillomandibulocardiac Reflex (MCR)**Scrotal Procedures:** Pulling on the spermatic cord

**Vasovagal syncope:** Pre-op psychological stress with IV starts  
  
**Treatment for Asystole  
**Immediately inform the surgeon and call for more anesthesia help  
Surgeon to stop operating  
Intubate (if not already intubated)  
100% O2 and manually ventilate  
Start chest compressions  
  
**Medications for Asystole**  
Epinephrine: 1 mg IV every 3-5 minutes  
  
  
**Treatment for Transient Asystole**  
(You do not know it’s transient at this point)

Immediately inform the surgeon and call for more anesthesia help and a code cart  
Heart rate returns to normal – maybe a slower rate  
Communicate with the surgeon for probable cause  
Prophylactically administer Atropine or Robinul and wait a few minutes  
Surgeon resumes  
  
**Example**  
During the onset of a pneumoperitoneum with the initiation of a laparoscopy, you witness severe bradycardia or asystole. You inform the surgeon and call for help while you are reaching for atropine. The surgeon immediately releases the CO2 and insufflation pressure and the stimulus of the vagal response is eliminated and the heart rhythm returns within in seconds. You already know the surgeon will eventually reattempt a pneumoperitoneum to continue the case. This time you will prophylactically administer either atropine or robinul and inform the surgeon when he/she may proceed.

Even though you believe the asystole is transient, you should always immediately call for help. You will not look good if the patient remains in asystole.

**More Notes**  
**Trigeminocardiac reflex (TCR)** is also known asOculocardiac Reflex (OCR), or Aschner phenomenon is a well known reflex that arises through manipulation of the trigeminal nerve via its pathway from the cranial base to its nerve endings o the mouth, jaw and face.

**Transient bradycardia and asystole with laparoscopy**  
In < 1% of healthy patients, bradycardia and asystole can occur during CO2 insufflation and pneumoperitoneum. Many believe it is from the stretching of the peritoneum inducing a vagal response.

Paradoxical' cardiovascular reflexes and baroreflex suppression may cause transient asystole

Severe hemorrhage can cause vasovagal syncope

Carotid sinus hypersensitivity (CSH): An exaggerated response to carotid sinus baroreceptor stimulation from the response to gentle carotid sinus massage applied just below the angle of the jaw, near the carotid bifurcation for between 5 and 10 seconds.

Profound bradycardia during lumbosacral spinal surgery has been reported. Its mechanism has been described as resulting from stimulation of afferent parasympathetic nerve endings due to traction on the dura, causing a reflex-coeliac (vasovagal) reaction

Previous studies have revealed that peripheral stimulation (anterior ethmoidal nerve in the nasal mucosa) co-actives vagal and sympathetic nerves, parasympathetically mediated bradycardia.

Stimulation anywhere in the innervation area of the maxillary and mandibular

Branches, probably leads to the same or at least similar reflex response, dependent on the stimulus quality, as observed for the **dentocardiac reflex**.

**Oculocardiac Reflex (OCR)  
**OCR has frequently been the substrate of case series reporting severe bradycardia or asystole caused by ocular surgery

**Trigeminocardiac reflex (TCR),** clinically known as an abrupt bradycardia and a sudden drop of blood pressure upon stimulation of any of the three branches of the trigeminal nerve.
