### Supraclavicular Nerve Block with Nerve Stimulator

Using a nerve stimulator to perform this block has become much rarer due to the visual aid of ultrasound.However, nerve stimulation can be used in addition to ultrasound guidance.**Stimulation.** The nerve stimulator is initially set at 1.0 to 1.2 mA.  
**Proper needle placement is indicated by:** Flexion or extension of the digits at 0.5 mA or less.  
  
**If the needle is too lateral:** Biceps contractions via stimulation of the musculocutaneous nerve  
  
**If the needle is anterior to the plexus:** Pectoralis muscle contraction  
  
**If the needle is posterior to the plexus:** Scapular movement  
  
**Intraneural needle position:** Contraction of the muscles of the arm, forearm, or wrist with stimulus below 0.4 mA  
  
**Aspiration of bright red blood:** Suggests subclavian artery penetration, indicating the needle is too medial.
