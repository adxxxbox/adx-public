## Laryngospasm Notes and Risk Factors

_The highest incidence of laryngospasm is found in procedures involving surgery and manipulations of the pharynx and larynx.  
  
_**Definition & Etiology**  
Complete closure of the glottic opening by constriction of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles. This is basically a primitive protective airway reflex to prevent pulmonary aspiration.  
Perioperative laryngospasm is an anesthetic emergency that is still responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients.

**True and Partial Laryngospasm**  
**Glottic closure occurs in two ways:  
**True vocal cord adduction alone (Glottic Spasm)  
True and false vocal cord adduction **(True Laryngospasm)**

**Glottic Spasm:** The adduction of only the true vocal cords. A minimal opening at the posterior commissure permits some air movement. This may contribute to the stridor that we sometimes hear.

**True Laryngospasm  
**Both the false and true vocal cords adduct  
Intralaryngeal part of epiglottis moves posteriorly  
No air movement, complete obstruction

A very common cause of intraoperative laryngospasm is light anesthesia at the time of stimulus._"With lack of inhibition of glottis reflexes due to inadequate CNS depression."_ Hampson‐Evans D, et al. Pediatric Anesthesia 2008; 18: 303‐7

**Prevention**  
**Pre-op:  
**Identify risk factors and try to minimize them.

**Pediatric Cases  
**We are fully aware that pediatric patients with a URI are prone to develop airway (upper and bronchial) hyperactivity that lasts beyond the period of viral infection. The epithelial damage from the URI heals in 1-2 weeks. Whereas a virus-induced sensitization of bronchial autonomic efferent pathways can last for up to 6-8 weeks. This is the reason we may postpone an a healthy looking pediatric patient within that grace period following a URU. BMT and tonsillectomies may be exempt because these patients have chronic URIs.

**Risk Factors**  
_Laryngospasms is the leading cause of perioperative cardiac arrest from respiratory origin in children._  
**0-1 year:** Has the highest rate of adverse perioperative respiratory events including laryngospasms.  
**Preschool age:** A very high incidence rate of laryngospasms appears to be preschool age children younger than 5 years.  
**After age 5**: The risk for adverse perioperative respiratory events decrease with each year of age.

**Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URI)  
****(Why we postpone many elective cases)  
**_(URI) is associated with a 2-5 fold increase in risk of laryngospasm_

**URI in an infant:** Risk of Laryngospasm is magnified, especially with an Respiratory Syncytial Virus infection (RSV)

These kids are prone to develop airway hyperactivity

Virus induced hypersensitive airways can last 6-8 weeks post URI.

**With children, we normally postpone elective cases when:  
**Temperature > 38C  
Mucopurulent airway secretions  
Lower airway wheezes and moist cough  
We usually make an exception with BMTs and Tonsils.

**Smoke Exposure**  
Household 2nd hand smoke can increase the incidence of laryngospasm 9% in children scheduled for otolaryngology and urologic surgery.  
For high-risk procedures, you should ask if the parents smoke.

**Precipitating factors (magnified with light anesthesia)  
**Vocal cord irritation  
Extubation  
Presence of a nasogastric tube  
EGDs  
Esophagoscopy  
Tonsillectomy - up to 25%  
Adenoidectomy - up to 25%  
Appendectomy  
Hypospadius repair  
Children with present or recent respiratory tract infections  
Blood and secretions in the airway  
Regurgitation/vomit  
Pungent inhalation agent  
Oropharyngeal airway  
Suction catheter  
Laryngoscopy

**Most Critical Period of Laryngospasm**  
Induction and emergence  
Some literature states that emergence from anesthesia is the most critical period.

**Insufficient depth of anesthesia is one of the major causes of laryngospasm  
**Any stimulation in the area supplied by the superior laryngeal nerve, while your patient is too light, may produce laryngospasm.

**Symptoms of Laryngospasm**  
Inspiratory stridor with airway obstruction  
Increased inspiratory efforts  
Paradoxical chest and abdominal movements  
Desaturation  
Cyanosis  
Bradycardia (Peds)  
Suprasternal, intercostals, subcostal retraction  
Small amount or no anesthesia bag movement  
Hypoxemia

**Laryngospasm Complications**  
Mild and severe hypoxia  
Bradycardia  
Negative Pressure Pulmonary Edema (NPPE), although not common in infants, probably due to pliable rib cage.  
Cardiac arrest
