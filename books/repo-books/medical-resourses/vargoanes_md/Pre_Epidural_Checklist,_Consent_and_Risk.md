**Epidural Risks and Consent - Pre-epidural**_  
All parturients should have had the risks of the epidural explained to them beforehand._  
As part of my job, I need to tell you about possible risks of an epidural, though they may be uncommon. The risks include bleeding, infection, back pain, failed block, nerve damage, bleeding in the back referred to as hematoma, and breathing and heart problems, but these, though serious, do not happen very often. There is also a 2 in 100 chance of getting something called a postdural puncture headache. This kind of headache is not dangerous and it is treatable or it goes away on its own, but it is usually a very bad headache so I just want to let you know that there is a risk for this. If you do end up getting this headache, you would usually not get it until 1-2 days from now."
