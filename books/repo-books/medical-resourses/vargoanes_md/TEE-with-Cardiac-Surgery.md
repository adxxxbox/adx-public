### TEE with Cardiac Surgery(Transesophageal Echocardiography

Use of TEE varies among institutions. In some practices, its use is restricted to procedures involving both bypass grafts and valve repair.  
  
The TEE probe is a long flexible instrument with an ultrasound sensor located at the tip.  
A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is a diagnostic procedure that uses echocardiography to assess the heart's function and structure.  
  
By inserting the transducer into the esophagus, TEE provides a clearer image of the heart because the sound waves do not have to pass through skin, muscle, or bone tissue.  
  
The TEE gives an examination of the heart’s structure and function. For CABGs, the most important assessment is the left ventricular function.  
  
Experience and proficiency with the TEE has dramatically improved the weaning process coming off pump.  
  
**The anesthesiologist can determine:**  
Contractility and global efficiency of the LV.  
Preload and volume status.  
CO and SV.  
  
**TEE before coming off CPB**  
In preparation for discontinuing bypass, the cardiac anesthesiologist will insert the TEE probe (if it is not already in place) to visualize the heart. Valuable information about the status of the heart at this vulnerable stage is obtained by TEE.  
  
By combining pressures from the PA catheter and the TEE results, problems can be assessed and correction begun. The etiologies of problems, be they related to volume status, contractility, or vasomotor tone, are determined, and measures are undertaken to correct them in order to facilitate a safe weaning from bypass.
