### Fioricet for Postdural Puncture Headache

Fioricet is primarily used to treat tension headaches caused by muscle contractions.  
It is now becoming popular as one of the conservative treatments for post-dural puncture headaches.  
  
**Other names:**  
Orbivan  
Alagesic LQ  
Dolgic Plus  
Esgic Plus  
Margesic  
Zebutal  
  
**Black Box Warnings:  
**Fioricet contains acetaminophen  
Hepatotoxicity may occur with acetaminophen doses that exceed 4 grams per day/day.  
Take into account all acetaminophen-containing products the patient is taking, including PRN doses and OTC products.  
  
**Fioricet** (a combination of acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine): PO  
**Fioricet contains:**  
325 mg of acetaminophen (NSAID)  
40 mg of caffeine  
50 mg of Butalbital (barbiturate)  
  
**Dose:** One or two tablets every 4 hours as needed.  
The total daily dosage should be at most six tablets.  
  
**Acetaminophen** is an NSAID, pain reliever, and fever reducer.  
**Butalbital is** a barbiturate. It relaxes muscle contractions involved in a tension headache.  
**Caffeine** is a central nervous system stimulant.  
Caffeine relaxes muscle contractions in blood vessels to improve blood flow.  
  
**Dose:**  
One or two tablets every 4 hours as needed.  
The total daily dosage should not exceed six tablets.  
  
**Other tablet strengths:**  
**butalbital/acetaminophen/caffeine ratio:**  
50mg/500mg/40mg (Esgic-Plus)  
50mg/750mg/40mg (Dolgic Plus)  
  
**Tension Headache:  
**\- 50 mg/300-325 mg/40 mg: 2 tablets or capsules PO q4hr; not to exceed six tablets or capsules/day  
  
\- 50 mg/500 mg/40 mg: 1 tablet/capsule PO q4hr; not to exceed six tablets or capsules/day  
\- 50 mg/750 mg/40 mg: 1 tablet/capsule PO q4hr; not to exceed five tablets or capsules/day  
\- 15-30 mL solution PO q4hr; not to exceed 180 mL solution/day  
\- Not to exceed four g/day of acetaminophen for any dosage form or regimen  
  
**Dosage Modifications:**  
**Renal impairment:** Not studied; use caution and reduce dosing if necessary in severe renal impairment  
  
**Hepatic impairment:** Not studied; use caution and reduce dosing if necessary in severe hepatic impairment  
  
**Mechanism of Action:****Butalbital:** Barbiturate; elicits generalized CNS depressant effects; depresses sensory cortex; decreases motor activity.  
**Acetaminophen:** Nonopioid, nonsalicylate analgesic; acts on hypothalamus to produce analgesia and antipyresis**Caffeine:** Vasoconstrictive properties of cerebral blood vessels may be helpful when treating headaches; improves skeletal muscle contraction and medullary respiratory center sensitivity; stimulates central inspiratory drive.  
  
**Possible adverse effects:  
**ButalbitalDizziness, drowsiness, the feeling of intoxication, lightheadedness, sedation  
Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting  
Shortness of breath  
**  
Acetaminophen  
**Angioedema, laryngeal edema  
Pruritic maculopapular rash, urticaria  
Agranulocytosis, leukopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura  
Hepatotoxicity  
Anaphylactoid reaction  
**  
Caffeine  
**Tachycardia, palpitations (dose dependent)  
Insomnia, irritability, nervousness, restlessness, tinnitus, tremor  
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting  
Diuresis  
  
**Lactation  
**Excreted in breast milk in small amounts; not recommended  
**  
Metabolism:**  
**Butalbital:  
**Metabolized in the liver by the CYP450 enzyme system  
Induces hepatic enzymes, but to a lesser degree than phenobarbital  
  
**Acetaminophen:  
**Metabolized in the liver by microsomal enzyme systems  
80-85% conjugated principally with glucuronic acid and to a lesser extent with sulfuric acid and cysteine  
4% metabolized by CYP450 to toxic metabolite (N acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine, N-acetylimidoquinone \[NAPQI\]), which is detoxified by conjugation with glutathione; high doses may deplete a fixed amount of glutathione in the body, causing NAPQI accumulation  
  
**Caffeine:  
**Metabolized in the liver via CYP1A2 to paraxanthine, theobromine, and theophylline  
  
**Elimination:  
Half-life:  
**35 hr butalbital  
2-4 hr acetaminophen  
3-7 hr caffeine  
  
**Excretion:**  
Butalbital (59-88% in urine);  
acetaminophen (90-100% in urine, principally as acetaminophen glucuronide with acetaminophen sulfate/mercaptate);  
caffeine (principally in urine)  
**Fioricet is contraindicated with the following drugs:  
Doravirine  
**Butalbital will decrease the level or effect of doravirine by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated. Coadministration of doravirine with a strong CYP3A inducer may decrease doravirine plasma concentrations and/or effects. Potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance to doravirine.   
**  
Fostemsavir  
**Butalbital will decrease the level or effect of fostemsavir by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated. Coadministration of fostemsavir (prodrug) with strong CYP3A4 inducers significantly decreases temsavir (active moiety) plasma concentrations, which may lead to loss of virologic response and resistance.  
**  
Isavuconazonium sulfate**  
Butalbital will decrease the level or effect of isavuconazonium sulfate by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated.  
  
**Isocarboxazid**  
Isocarboxazid increases the effects of caffeine by pharmacodynamic synergism. Contraindicated. Risk of an acute hypertensive episode.  
  
**Linezolid  
**Linezolid increases the effects of caffeine by pharmacodynamic synergism. Contraindicated. Risk of an acute hypertensive episode.  
**  
Lonafarnib  
**Butalbital will decrease the level or effect of lonafarnib by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated. Lonafarnib is a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate. Coadministration with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers is contraindicated.  
**  
Lorlatinib**  
Butalbital will decrease the level or effect of lorlatinib by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated. Coadministration of lorlatinib with strong CYP3A inducers is contraindicated. Discontinue the strong CYP3A inducer for three plasma half-lives before initiating lorlatinib.  
  
**Mavacamten**  
Butalbital will decrease the level or effect of mavacamten by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated.  
  
**Phenelzine**  
Phenelzine increases the effects of caffeine by pharmacodynamic synergism. Contraindicated. Risk of an acute hypertensive episode.
