### Heart Transplant Facts and Drugs that Work and Don't Work

\- With a heart transplant, there is a loss of direct nerve input (nerve denervation) from the autonomic nervous system, thus resulting in loss of innervation for both the parasympathetic and sympathetic responses.  
\- Visceral innervation is also lost.  
\- Thus, the denervated heart doesn't respond to cardiac and other drugs in the same manner as a native heart.  
\- The compensatory reflex tachycardia is lost.  
  
**Reinnervation with a transplanted heart:**  
\- There is evidence that reinnervation of the transplanted heart does occur, especially after 15 years.  
\- The patient's heart rate and response to drugs may vary depending on how long ago the transplant occurred.  
\- Reinnervation after heart transplantation is unpredictable.  
  
**Resting heart rate 90-130 bpm:  
**The elevated heart rate is due to the lack of parasympathetic innervation, although the heart rate may vary depending on the age of the graft.  
**Valsalva maneuvers and carotid massage:** Not effective.  
**Baroreceptor reflexes are lost:** No response to direct laryngoscopy/intubation.  
  
**Angina with episodes of myocardial ischemia:**  
Patients may lack chest pain due to the absence of visceral innervation with myocardial ischemia.  
  
**Frank Starling's effect remains intact:  
**\- These patients are highly dependent on adequate intravascular volume and preload.  
\- The transplanted heart responds well to increases in preload, increasing stroke volume and cardiac output.  
  
**Vasoactive and antiarrhythmic agents' effects on a denervated transplanted heart:****Isoproterenol** (Isuprel®): Increases HR, inotrope  
**Epinephrine:** Increases HR, inotrope, and vasopressor  
**Norepinephrine:** Increases HR, inotrope, and vasopressor  
**Dobutamine:** Can also increase HR, inotrope  
**Milrinone:** Does not work as well as epinephrine, inotrope  
**Dopamine:** Weak inotrope and acts predominantly as a dopaminergic and vasopressor.  
**Ephedrine:** Blunted response because it is an indirect-acting vasopressor that exerts its effects via the autonomic nervous system.  
**Propranolol:** Decreases HR and contractility  
**CaCl2:** 0.5-1 gram can be effective in increasing contractility in a denervated heart, but lacks adequate supporting literature.  
**Digoxin:** No change in heart rate, inotrope  
**Adenosine:** Will cause a significantly prolonged and profound bradycardic effect  
**Verapamil:** May cause severe bradycardia  
  
**Phenylephrine:** Vasopressor  
_A study has shown that coronary vasoconstriction can occur in atherosclerotic coronary arteries of transplanted hearts._  
However, normal coronary arteries in transplanted hearts exhibited vasodilation.  
  
**Agents that cause vasodilation may cause profound hypotension due to the absence of compensatory reflex tachycardia.**  
Nitroglycerine  
Nicardipine  
Hydralizine  
Propofol  
To avoid or minimize hypotension, these agents are administered in small incremental doses or titrated very gradually.  
  
**Etomidate:** Considered safe  
  
**Neuromuscular blocking agents:  
**Pancuronium and succinylcholine will not exert usual effects on the heart rate but will retain their extracardiac effects.  
**Rocuronium and** **cisatracurium:** Safe  
  
**Muscle relaxant reversals:**  
**Neostigmine:** Controversial  
Literature varies from no change in heart rate to severe bradycardia and asystole.  
There are rare cases of advanced heart block and asystole after neostigmine administration to heart transplant recipients.  
It is presumably due to some degree of parasympathetic reinnervation of the transplanted heart over time.  
  
**Anticholinergic agents** **(eg, glycopyrrolate, atropine):** Will NOT effectively treat bradycardia but retain their effects on noncardiac tissue.  
  
**Sugammadex:** Does not have cholinergic effects.  
There is limited literature on the effect of sugammadex and a denervated heart.  
Sugammadex should also be administered with caution.
