Ofirmev (Acetaminophen, Tylenol)

**Ofirmev (Acetaminophen, Tylenol), IV Form**  
**Dose**  
15mg/kg < 50kg  
1,000mg > 50kg  
**Max in 24 hours:** 4 grams.  
  
Studies show a reduction in narcotic consumption after administering Ofirmev.  
  
Starting to replace Toradol for post op pain because Ofirmev does not increase bleeding time. Surgeons like that. It comes in a 1,000mg small bottle. Since most of our adult patients are over 50kg, we usually just use secondary tubing and let it drip in slowly.  
The insert tells you to infuse it over 15 minutes. You can give this drug in the beginning or the end of the case. The half life is 2-4 hours. So if you are doing a 6 hour case, it doesn’t make good anesthesia sense to give it right after induction.  
**Always check to see** if your patient is already taking a narcotic containing Tylenol. Percocet has Tylenol. Norco, Excedrin (all forms of Excedrin), Actifed, Contac, Coricidin, Dristan, Formula 44, Midol, Nyquil, Robitussin, Sudafed, Vicks, Lortab, Tramadol, and even Goody’s Powders all have Tylenol in them. So go over your patient's medical history and question them carefully. A combination of any of the above OTC/Rx meds plus Ofirmev can put the patient at risk for liver failure.  
One of my colleagues put this 50 year old male to sleep for a lap appendectomy. His medical history was benign; 2 prior anesthetics without complications. He stated he drank "usually a 6 pack a day" and occasionally "more on weekends when a party was on." No pre-op labs were ordered. Especially any liver enzyme studies. Not unusual for this day and age of budget crunches. The CRNA gave him 1 gram of Ofirmev over 15 minutes during the last 20 minutes of the case, after the lap trocars were out and skin closure began.  
In PACU, after he woke up, this patient erupted with such a series of RUQ pains that the surgeon seriously considered going back for an Exploratory Laparotomy for bleeding or perforation. Fortunately, the anesthesia team talked the surgeon into doing some stat liver studies and they found out the patient had early stage cirrhosis and the Tylenol was not metabolizing well. So a word to the wise.  
**Finally, here is a quiz that you can give your colleagues:**  
What drug is included in OFIRMEV that you might never expect? Mannitol. It has 3,850 mgs or almost 4 grams of Mannitol in each and every bottle.  
  
**Possible Complications**  
Vomiting, headache, and insomnia in adult patients and nausea, vomiting, constipation, pruritus, agitation, and atelectasis in pediatric patients. The antipyretic effects of OFIRMEV may mask fever in patients treated for postsurgical pain.  
  
**Contraindications**  
Severe liver impairment or disease. Hypersensitivity to acetaminophen or other additives in the formulation. Mannitol allergy.  
**Caution with:**  
Alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia, or severe renal impairment.
