# Desmopressin Acetate

**Desmopressin Acetate (DDAVP)**  
WARNING-Make Sure you have Desmopressin and NOT Vasopressin.  
It is chemically related to the natural hormone vasopressin, which is produced by the pituitary gland.  
**Mix:** Dilute in 50ml NS for IV administration.  
**Doses for Bleeding Issues:**  
**Hemophilia A:** 4 mcg dose when factor VIII coagulant activity levels > 5%. Do not give when below 5%.  
**Hemostasis for surgery and post op (hemophilia B)**  
Give 30 minutes before surgery.  
0.1-0.4 mcg/kg over 10 minutes.  
0.4 mcg/kg has been known to increase in Factor VIII plasma levels 300 to 400% (max) within 30-120 minutes.  
**Diabetes Insipidus:** 4 mcg and also for temporary polyuria and polydipsia following head trauma or surgery in the pituitary region.  
**Peds:** 4 mcg/mL should not be used in infants less than three months of age in the treatment of hemophilia A or von Willebrand's disease; safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 12 years of age with diabetes insipidus have not been established.  
**Routes:** IV, SQ, or Intranasal routes.  
**Onset:** 30 min  
**Half Life:** 75 min  
**Eilimination:** urine  
**Indications:**  
Bleeding complications relating to Hemophilia.  
Bleeding complications von Willebrand's Disease (Type 1).  
Treat Central Diabetes Insipidis (DI).  
**Mechanism of Action for Bleeding Issues:**  
Stimulates the release of von Willebrand's factor necessary for transporting factor VIII to where the formation of a clot is needed and also for platelet adhesion.  
**Mechanism of Action for Diabetes Insipidis (DI)**  
The most common type l DI is caused by a deficiency of arginine vasopressin (AVP), also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH).  
Desmopressin mimics the action of vasopressin on the kidneys which results in concentration of the urine and hence normal urine volume and flow.  
**NOT indicated for:**  
Hemophilia A with factor VIII coagulant activity levels Hemophilia B  
Patients who have factor VIII antibodies.  
However, DDAVP is ineffective for the treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.  
**Adverse events:** Water intoxication and hyponatremia.  
Transient hypotension can be seen with rapid IV injection.  
**NOT indicated for:**  
Hemophilia A with factor VIII coagulant activity levels treatment of hemophilia B  
Patients who have factor VIII antibodies  
**CONTRAINDICATIONS**  
Hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate.  
Patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.  
Patients with hyponatremia.  
Because DDAVP can cause water intoxication-hyponatremia from being a potent antidiuretic so fluid restriction is recommended.  
Don't use to treat patients with Type IIB von Willebrand's disease since platelet aggregation may be induced.  
Used with caution in patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may be more likely to drink excessive amounts of water, putting them at greater risk of hyponatremia.  
**Mechanism of Action:**  
Stimulates the release of von Willebrand's factor necessary for transporting factor VIII to where the formation of a clot is needed and also for platelet adhesion. **More Notes**  
**What is Desmopressin?**  
Synthetic analogue of the natural pituitary hormone 8-arginine vasopressin (ADH), an antidiuretic hormone affecting renal water conservation.  
The change in structure of vasopressin to DDAVP has resulted in a decreased vasopressor action and decreased actions on visceral smooth muscle relative to the enhanced antidiuretic activity, so that clinically effective antidiuretic doses are usually below threshold levels for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. This is good because vasopressin is a VERY VERY potent vasoconstrictor!!  
**CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY**  
DDAVP has been shown to be more potent than arginine vasopressin in increasing plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand's disease Type I.  
DDAVP provides a prompt onset of antidiuretic action with a long duration after each administration.  
Sub Q injection of DDAVP has an antidiuretic effect 10x that of it intranasally at an equivalent dose.  
In certain clinical situations, it may be justified to try DDAVP in patients with factor VIII levels between 2% to 5%; however, these patients should be carefully monitored.  
**Those von Willebrand's disease patients who are LEAST likely to respond:**  
Severe homozygous von Willebrand's disease with factor VIII coagulant activity  
When factor VIII von Willebrand factor antigen levels less than 1%.  
When there is evidence of an abnormal molecular form of factor VIII antigen.  
Because DDAVP can cause water intoxication-hyponatremia from being a potent antidiuretic, so fluid restriction is recommended.  
Don't use to treat patients with Type IIB von Willebrand's disease since platelet aggregation may be induced.  
Used with caution in patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may be more likely to drink excessive amounts of water, putting them at greater risk of hyponatremia.  
**PRECAUTIONS**  
There ave been rare reports of thrombotic events following an Injection 4 mcg with predisposed to thrombus formation. No causality has been determined, however, the drug should be used with caution in these patients.  
Severe allergic reactions have been reported rarely. Anaphylaxis has been reported rarely with intravenous and intranasal DDAVP, including isolated cases of fatal anaphylaxis with intravenous DDAVP.  
It is not known whether antibodies to DDAVP injection are produced after repeated injections.  
**ADVERSE REACTIONS**  
Transient headache, nausea, mild abdominal cramps and vulval pain.  
Local erythema, swelling or burning pain.  
Facial flushing  
Severe allergic reactions-rare .  
Water intoxication and hyponatremia.  
**OVERDOSAGE**  
Signs of overdose may include confusion, drowsiness, continuing headache, problems with passing urine and rapid weight gain due to fluid retention. In case of overdosage, the dosage should be reduced, frequency of administration decreased, or the drug withdrawn according to the severity of the condition.  
There is no known specific antidote for DDAVP.
