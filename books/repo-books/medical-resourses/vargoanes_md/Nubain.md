# Nubain

**Nubain (nalbuphine)**  
**Class:** agonist-antagonist opioid  
I have never given this drug, NARCAN is the antagonist drug usually available in the anesthesia drug boxes. Nubain is NOT usually kept in the operating rooms.  
**Dose:** 10-20mg IV can reverse respiratory depression but still maintain analgesia.  
Nubain is basically has analgesic potency similar to morphine in a mg basis, and has antagonist (reversal) properties (esp. respiratory depression) at the same time.  
So it can reverse the respiratory depression from a narcotic but still offer some analgesia.  
**Nubain is primarily a:**  
Kappa agonist  
Partial mu antagonist analgesic  
You can only give so much Nubaine because it has a ceiling effect.  
There is also evidence of recurrent hypoventilation often occurs 2 to 3 hours after administration of Nubain. This is why you should inform the post op nurses if you gave it.  
The onset of action of Nubain occurs within 2 to 3 minutes after IV administration.  
Receptor studies show that Nubain binds to mu, kappa, and delta receptors.
