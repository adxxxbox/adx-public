Nephrectomy-Radical (Complete) – Laparoscopic     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Nephrectomy-Radical (Complete) – Laparoscopic

Removing the entire kidney, ureter, adrenal gland and the fatty tissue surrounding the kidney.  
3 to 4 small incisions are made in the wall of the abdomen.

Once the surgeon reaches the area of the kidney, he/she identifies the renal artery, vein and ureter and separates them from surrounding tissues. The blood vessels and ureter are ligated and the kidney is then removed

**Pre-Op**: EKG, CBC, PT / PTT, CMP, Urinalysis and Type & Cross.  
Have 2 units of blood on stand-by. Not as common anymore

**Anesthetic**: General/ETT  
A-line: Depends how sick the patient is. Despite less EBL today, some still prefer to put one in because of the potential large blood loss. I have seen some go without an **A-line**.

**Nitrous Oxide**: No, it can expand the bowel and get in the way.  
**IV Access:** 2 large bore for potential blood loss.  
If it’s a dialysis patient, avoid an extremity with an A-V Fistula.  
Those who will need future dialysis, forearm veins should be preserved for the creation of future fistulae and therefore not used.  
**Neosynephrine Drip:** Yes  
**IV Fluid:** Normal Saline and Potassium containing fluids should be avoided in those with impaired renal function.  
**Fluid Balance:** Some surgeons still prefer these patients to get a bowel prep. This is not as common anymore.

Any patient with ESRD who has had recent dialysis may likewise be fluid depleted pre-operatively. Appropriate fluid resuscitation must be given to any patient with signs of dehydration pre-operatively to avoid excessive hypotension at induction to anesthesia. Otherwise, replacement fluids to compensate for pre-operative fasting and bowel preparation must be given early during surgery.

**Position**: Supine for anterior (abdominal) approach or  
Lateral (transperitoneal) approach with axillary roll.  
Kidney Rest: Up (“breaking” the table in the middle) used to raise the loin and improve surgical access.  
Patient’s waist should be over the middle break in the OR table.

**EBL**: Some literature states 200-750mLs. In reality with an experienced surgeon it’s around 200mLs. Remember, they temporarily clamp the renal artery!

Greater EBL if it’s tumor related, because it could be vascular.  
The kidney is a very vascular organ and hemorrhage is a real risk. Bleeding can occur from the renal artery, the inferior vena cava, or from aberrant arteries.

**Duration**: 90 minutes - 3 hours

**Possible Complications**:  
Hemorrhage  
Sepsis of the surgical wound  
Anesthesia Risks

**More Notes**:  
Remember, renal patients tend to have other comorbidities:

HTN- from increased activity of the renin/angiotensin system.  
Ischemic heart disease  
PVD.  
Edema may be due to proteinuria and hypoalbuminaemia, or as a result of cardiac failure.  
Pericarditis can occur in uremic patients. Peripheral and autonomic neuropathies may be present.

If the kidney is being removed for donation, one incision must be enlarged to between 6 and 9 centimeters so that the kidney can be removed in one piece. Usually, this larger incision is next to the navel or in women, along the bikini line in the lower abdomen.

A portion of each kidney is protected by the lowest one or two ribs and by the muscles that cover the back and side of the body.
