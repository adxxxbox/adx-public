Melanoma Excision     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Melanoma Excision

As you know Melanoma is a very aggressive skin CA. The excision around the mole is HUGE compared to a BBC because it requires 1-2cm margins for malignant lesions with Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsies for metastasis determination. Lymphoscintigrams are sometimes done to determine the most active lymph region for the uptake based on tumor region.

**Lymphoscintigram**  
A small amount of radioactive tracer is administered by injection into the region of interest as it’s picked up and traced to the lymph nodes. Low levels of radiation will be emitted and detected by a gamma probe.

**Anesthetic**: General/LMA or Propofol infusion

**Duration:** 30-90 minutes  
**Position:** Usually supine depends on location of the melanoma.  
**EBL:** 5-30mLs  
**IV Access:** 20G  
**Complications:** Minimal
