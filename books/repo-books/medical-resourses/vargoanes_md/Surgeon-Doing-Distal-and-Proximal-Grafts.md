### Distal and Proximal Grafts

After the LIMA is clearly harvested and clamped, saphenous grafts from the leg should now be ready.  
The distal ends of the saphenous grafts are done first one by one to the diseased coronary arteries on the surface of the heart. The LIMA distal end is the last one anastomosed.  
  
**After Distal Ends are connected:**  
Blood is being rewarmed by perfusionist.  
Aortic cross clamp is removed.  
Side biting clamp is attached to the lateral wall of the ascending aorta.  
Aortic punch makes holes in aorta for proximal grafts.  
  
Surgeon will next take the remaining proximal ends and attach them to the ascending aorta. Details below.  
  
First the surgeon will unclamp the aortic cross clamp permitting the continuous flow from the bypass machine through the aorta. He will then locate the exact area on the ascending aorta where he plans to attach the proximal grafts.  
  
He then will use a small C-shaped clamp called the ”aortic side biter clamp) that will clamp off the lateral wall of the ascending aorta.  
  
This is a lateral clamp and not a cross clamp, so blood is still flowing through the aorta. This side biter clamp will isolate that lateral wall area from the rest of the blood flowing through the aorta. This will keep blood from escaping and obscuring the field while he is connecting the proximal grafts to the ascending aorta.  
  
The surgeon will uses an aortic punch to embed a hole in the structure of the ascending aorta to which the proximal grafts will be anastomosed. Next, the grafts are attached, one by one.  
  
By this time, the heart will be beating. When the side biter clamp is released, the newly connected grafts will be perfusing from the aorta for the first time. This is the important re-perfusion time following CPB. The heart vessels must be adequately cleared of metabolites, and all areas of the heart re-perfused for optimal contraction.
