### Pulmonary Hypertension (PHT) and Pregnancy

_For a better understanding of PHT, consider reviewing the “Pulmonary Hypertension” files._  
  
PHT is defined as a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) 25 mmHg or more at rest as diagnosed by right heart catheterization.  
Severe PHT is present when the mPAP is > 55 mmHg.  
  
**Right heart failure and PHT:  
**The right ventricle is much thinner and less muscular than the left ventricle and cannot compensate as well with extra volume, which increases the susceptibility to failure.  
The right ventricle is already at risk for failure from an increased PVR.  
  
**Why PHT is poorly tolerated with pregnancy:  
**Blood volume increases by 40–50% and peaks around 20–32 weeks’ gestation.  
Increase in HR and stroke volume results in increased cardiac output (CO).  
**During labor and delivery:** Further increase in CO by 25-50%  
**Immediate postpartum:** CO can be more than 80% of pre-labor values due to auto transfusion from uterine contraction (fluid shift) and the relief of inferior **vena cava** compression.  
This additional hemodynamic stress may result in increased pulmonary hypertension and refractory right heart failure.  
  
**Mortality with PHT**  
Pulmonary hypertension in pregnant patients carries high mortality rates between 30% and 56% and is also the important cause of increased perioperative morbidity and mortality.  
The deterioration of parturients with PHT usually occurs between the 20th and 24th weeks of gestation when most pregnancy-induced hemodynamic changes occur.  
Deterioration as early as 12 weeks’ gestation resulting in a therapeutic abortion for maternal survival has been reported.  
Unfortunately, some of these patients may deteriorate quickly and die before a therapeutic abortion could be performed.  
Pregnancy is still considered contraindicated in these patients and are often counseled for a termination of pregnancy.  
  
_PTH manifestations with pregnancy may overlap with a normal pregnancy._  
  
**Manifestations may include:  
**Dyspnea-initial symptom and a 98% occurrence rate with PHT diagnosis  
Weakness  
Fatigue  
Chest pain  
Syncope  
Abdominal discomfort  
  
**Cardiac examination may reveal:**  
Split S 2 with a loud second component  
Right ventricular heave  
Tricuspid regurgitation murmur  
Prominent pulmonic component of the second heart sound with elevated jugular venous pulse,  
Ascites  
Hepatomegaly  
Jugular venous distention  
Peripheral edema  
  
**Initial medical intervention for parturients with PHT:**  
Parturients should be referred to a tertiary hospital.  
Collaborative efforts between obstetricians, anesthesiologists, cardiologists, pulmonologists, and intensivists is recommended.  
**  
Depending on the severity, some attempts are initiated to reduce PHT prior to labor or elective c-section:**  
Administration of oxygen  
Bronchodilators  
Antibiotics  
Steroids to patients with obstructive lung disease  
Pulmonary vasodilators  
Inotropes to patients with cardiac disease  
  
**Supportive measures include:**  
Advice on anticoagulation  
Diuretics  
Oxygen therapy- reduces pulmonary vascular resistance  
  
**Fluid management:  
**These patients poorly tolerate both hypo- and hypervolemia.  
Excessive fluid may further impair RV function.  
Management involves diuresis or hemofiltration.  
  
**TEE is suggested for high-risk patients to assess for:** Tricuspid regurgitation and volume overload.  
  
**Pulmonary vasodilators for PHT:  
**_For details, refer to “Pulmonary Hypertension Medications” for details.  
  
_**Endothelin receptor blockers** are considered teratogenic (Category X) and they need to be discontinued immediately.  
Three common PO drugs in this class are: bosentan, ambrisentan, and macitentan.  
  
**Prostacyclin (prostaglandin) analogs:  
**Prostacyclin analogs are documented as the drug of choice for **parturients** with PHT.  
Most of the published case reports describe initiating intravenous (IV) epoprostenol several weeks before or near the time of delivery.However, there are still no recommendations available during pregnancy, but there are several case reports with good outcomes.  
  
**Concerns with epoprostenol:** May inhibit platelet aggregation with increased bleeding during delivery and in postpartum period.  
  
**Thromboprophylaxis or anticoagulation:  
**Pregnant patients have an increased risk of DVTs which may result is pulmonary embolism.  
Anticoagulant treatment is recommended for patients with PHT.  
Most pregnant patients with PHT are placed on thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy and continue through postpartum, with only brief interruption around time of delivery.  
Avoid Warfarin as it is teratogenic.  
Subcutaneous injection of enoxaparin (1 mg/kg twice daily) is recommended.  
**  
Nitric oxide meds:**  
During labor and hospitalization, continuously inhaled NO can also be used to lower the pulmonary vascular pressure.  
AlBackr _et al._ have used intraoperative NO to reduce pulmonary arterial systolic pressure and successfully delivered a healthy neonate.  
Pulmonary pressures were controlled with nebulization of iloprost and sildenafil, and the patient was discharged on tablet sildenafil.  
  
**Vasoconstrictors, inotropes, and inodilators:  
**Systolic RV failure with low cardiac output and hypotension may require inotropic agents.  
**  
Avoid elevated doses of Beta 1 agonist (sympathomimetics):  
**They may offset by chronotropic effects precipitating tachyarrhythmias, as well as worsening pulmonary vasoconstriction.  
  
**Low dose Dobutamine (≤ 10mcg/kg/min):** Has favorable pulmonary vascular effects.  
Larger doses may result in increased PVR, tachycardia, and systemic hypotension.  
**Dopamine:** Not recommended as it may increase tachyarrhythmias.  
  
**Vasopressors:  
Levophed** and **vasopressin** are two beneficial medications.**  
  
Vasopressors do the following:  
**Improve perfusion of the right coronary artery.  
Reduce the pulmonary/systemic vascular resistance ratio  
Enhance right ventricular performance  
Marginally improves cardiac output  
  
**Norepinephrine:** Improves RV function both by improving SVR and CO although it may increase PVR at higher doses.  
  
**Vasopressin (low dose):** May reduce PVR and PVR/SVR ratio.  
Low doses may also be useful in difficult cases with vasodilatory shock and pulmonary hypertension.  
  
**Phenylephrine:** May improve right coronary perfusion in RV failure without causing tachycardia.  
Unfortunately, though, this benefit may be offset by worsening RV function due to increased PVR.  
  
**Phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitors:  
**These drugs reduce augment myocardial contractility while reducing PVR and SVRHowever, medications that may reduce SVR can compromise right coronary artery blood flow in patients with severe PHT and therefore they should be administered cautiously.**Milrinone** has have been shown to be beneficial when compared with the conventional inotropic support only.  
  
**Nebulized milrinone** (through pulmonary selectivity): Has less systemic hypotension and V/Q mismatch compared with intravenous use.  
  
**Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors:  
**Currently available drugs are sildenafil and tadalafil, both taken orally.  
These drugs decrease PVR and has a positive inotropic effect on the hypertrophic right ventricle.  
Using sildenafil to treat PHT in **parturients** appears to be safe but requires additional study.  
  
**Initial evaluation** **for parturients** **with PHT:**  
Risk assessment that takes into account their functional state, severity of the disease, and type of surgery proposed.  
Assess for their functional state and severity of the disease.  
**  
Assess for associated FHT manifestations:  
**Dyspnea-initial symptom and a 98% occurrence rate with PHT diagnosis  
Weakness  
Fatigue  
Chest pain  
Abdominal discomfort  
Syncope- usually related to the inability to increase cardiac output on exertion and a sign of advanced functional class via New York Heart Association.

**PA= physical activity  
**  
**Pre-delivery tests:  
ECG possible findings with PHT:  
**Right-axis deviation  
Right bundle branch block  
Right ventricular hypertrophy  
Tall R waves in leads V1 and V2.  
Right atrial hypertrophy and “P-pulmonale” may be present in severe pulmonary hypertension, with peaked P -waves, usually in leads II, III, aVF, and V1.**  
  
Chest X-ray (with adnominal shield) and assess:  
**For heart size  
Pulmonary congestion and consolidation  
Pleural effusions.  
Enlarged main pulmonary artery and a globular heart shape  
Loss of the retrosternal airspace from right ventricular dilation**  
  
Echocardiography and assess:  
**regional and global ventricular function  
Valve structure and functionPericardial effusion  
Regional and global ventricular function  
Mechanical complications of myocardial infarction (MI).  
**A specific sign RV failure:** Paradoxical septal motion in systole with shifting to the left ventricle (D-shaped septum), reflecting RV overload.  
  
**Labs:  
**CBC  
Coagulation studiesC-reactive protein  
Serum creatinine and electrolytes  
LFTs  
Glucose  
Troponin, creatine phosphokinase myocardial band and brain natriuretic peptide levels may assist in confirming the diagnosis and allow an estimation of severity in heart failure and MI.  
  
**Lung ultrasonography or CT** may help differentiate the causes of PHT.  
**  
Monitoring during anesthesia:  
**ASAConsider arterial line  
  
**Mild-to-moderate to severe PHT with existing right heart failure:  
**Transesophageal echocardiograpmy (TEE) and a pulmonary artery catheter should be considered.However, TEEs are not well tolerated in awake patients undergoing regional anesthesia.  
The insertion of pulmonary artery catheter is controversial and less frequently used.  
  
**Anesthesia and L&D goals for parturients with PHT:  
**Avoid further increase in PVR  
Avoid marked decrease in venous return  
Avoid marked reduction in systemic vascular resistance  
Avoid myocardial depression.  
Avoid hypo and hypervolemia  
  
All PHT medications should be continued perioperatively.  
**  
Labor induction:  
**Early induction may be needed when PHT worsens and the termination of pregnancy is indicated.**Prostaglandin E** and **oxytocin** may be used as they also produce pulmonary vasodilatation.  
**Low oxytocin rates** appear to have no significant hemodynamic effects.  
**Prostaglandin F2α** should be avoided as it induces pulmonary vasoconstriction.  
  
**Neuraxial anesthesia:  
**Consider _avoiding a subarachnoid block (spinal)_ due to the rapidity of action, at the cost of causing hemodynamic instability.  
  
**Epidural anesthesia:  
**Continuous epidural infusion is preferred.  
Epidural is preferred because of the slow onset which takes, about 15–20 minutes and usually permits hemodynamic stability.  
Epidural anesthesia provides better hemodynamic stability and prevents the adrenergic response seen during general anesthesia during intubation, which can be deleterious in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension.  
  
**Complication of blocking thoracic cardiac sympathetic fibers:  
**A possible complication of PHT when neuraxial anesthesia blocks cardiac sympathetic fibers in the upper thoracic region.  
This disrupts right ventricular homeometric autoregulation.  
When this occurs, it may result in a critical reduction in cardiac output and right heart failure that is not due to impaired right ventricular coronary flow dynamics or systemic vasodilation.  
  
**C-section vs vaginal delivery:  
Mode of delivery is controversial in parturients with PHT.  
**There are NO absolute recommendations for the mode of delivery with these patients as vaginal and c-section deliveries each have advantages and disadvantages.  
**  
Anesthesia:  
**Epidural or low-dose combined spinal-epidural anesthesia.  
Early effective analgesia is essential to maintain SVR and PVR balance to avoid sympathetic stimulation resulting from pain.  
Early epidural analgesia is recommended before labor advances as analgesia plays an important role in attenuating the stress response to labor.  
When neuraxial anesthesia is contraindicated due to anticoagulation, a low-dose remifentanil infusion or patient-controlled analgesia are suitable alternatives.  
During vaginal delivery, the patient should avoid pushing and vacuum extraction should be utilized.  
  
**Advantages of vaginal delivery in PHT:  
**Minimizes the risk of anesthesia exposure  
Less change in blood volume  
Less bleeding  
Less risk of infection  
Less fluid volume (hydration is recommended during C-section)  
Lower thromboembolic risk  
**  
Disadvantages of vaginal delivery in PHT:**  
Delivery may be impose stress and pain, which are poorly tolerated in PHT.  
Sympathetic increase in blood pressure and pulse rate increases the load on the RV  
_An inadequate epidural and bearing down efforts can be disastrous.  
_  
**Anesthetic and hemodynamic goals for c-section in parturients with PHT:**  
Maintain preload  
Avoid increase in PVR: Prevent hypoxia, hypercarbia, acidosis and pain  
Maintain systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (Decreased SVR reduces cardiac output due to a “fixed” PVR)  
Avoid myocardial depressants; maintain myocardial contractility  
Maintain sinus rhythm  
**_Cesarean delivery_** _during regional anesthesia with invasive monitoring seems to be an attractive approach  
_**C-section:** Some authorities recommend elective C-section in week 34-36.  
**Advantages of a C-section in PHT:**  
May be performed electively under optimal conditions  
Can avoid prolonged stress and pain  
Reduces the duration of the second stage of labor  
Reduces the adverse effects of bearing down  
  
**C-section with general anesthesia:  
**Sympathetic stimulation has deleterious effects on right ventricular afterload.Have an adequate depth of anesthesia prior to direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation,  
Avoid: Hypercarbia, acidosis, high inspiratory pressures, and high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).  
**  
Circulation:  
**Maintain the preanesthetic hemodynamic condition.  
Consider invasive monitoring before induction.  
A safe and effective approach to management of the reduction in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) caused by anesthetic drugs is to administer low doses of vasoconstrictors.  
1-2 unit boluses of vasopressin is useful for anesthesia-induced hypotension.  
A continuous infusion may also be warranted.  
  
**Intravenous anesthetic agents**  
Etomidate is the induction agent of choice  
Propofol decreases right ventricular contractility  
Ketamine increases pulmonary vascular resistance  
Fentanyl and sufentanil have minimal effects on pulmonary hemodynamics.  
Remifentanil produces minor pulmonary vasodilatation from histamine release and may be administered just prior to induction.  
Remifentanil will blunt the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation, and its brief duration of action prevents prolonged effect.  
  
**Inhalation agents:  
**Isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane all reduce right ventricular function in a dose-dependent fashion with little effect on PVR  
Avoid nitrous oxide because increases PVR  
**  
Postpartum care in PHT:  
**The majority of deaths occur in the peripartum period, mainly within the first month after delivery.  
  
Right ventricular function with PHT is “preload dependent.”  
Avoiding fluid overloading is detrimental.  
Maintaining SVR with vasopressors, inotropes, and replacement of blood volume when necessary are all important measures.  
Pulmonary vasodilator therapy that was initiated intraoperatively must be continued and slowly weaned.  
  
**Treatment for atrial arrhythmia:** Amiodarone is the drug of choice.  
Beta-blockers should be avoided.  
**  
Possible postpartum complications:  
**Bleeding  
InfectionFluid shiftsPulmonary vasoconstriction  
Atrial arrhythmias (associated with right heart failure)  
Pulmonary thromboembolismRespiratory failure (60%)  
Right ventricular failure (50%)  
  
Adequate patient controlled IV analgesia or epidural analgesia can be used.  
  
**Pulmonary embolism:** Careful monitoring of the patient and appropriate supportive treatment are needed to prevent the development of right heart failure.
