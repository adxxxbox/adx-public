### Ureteral Stent Placement

After the lasering and removing a ureteral or kidney stone, the ureter may swell from irritation and occlude. It is common practice for a urologist to insert a ureteral stent.

Basically inserted to keep a ureter patent.  
Passage of the ureteroscope may result in swelling of the ureter. Therefore, they usually insert a stent. The stent travels from the kidney, down the ureter and into the bladder. Occasionally, a thin string attached to the end of the stent will be left exiting the bladder. This will aid future removal of the stent once the swelling subsides. The stent may also assist in the passage of any residual stone fragments. It is not uncommon for some patients to experience some discomfort from the stent. A minor amount of blood is expected in the urine while the stent is in place.

URS is considered safe and effective, but, as with any procedure, risks exist. They include perforation of the ureter and formation of scar tissue that narrows the diameter of the ureter. These adverse events are encountered more frequently when a stone is found lodged or embedded in the wall of the ureter. If perforation occurs, an attempt will be made to place a temporary stent within the ureter to allow the area to heal. In the event that a stent cannot be safely placed, a small tube may need to be placed into the kidney to direct urine away from the damaged area. Fortunately, scar tissue formation in the ureter is rare, occurring in less than one percent of cases. However, when it happens, obstruction to the flow of urine may result. Obstruction can cause pain and may damage the kidney if allowed to persist. Additional intervention is often necessary to treat the narrowed area.

**Possible Complications:**  
Perforation or a tear anywhere along the ureter. The risk of perforation increases with the complexity of the procedure being performed. Most perforations can be managed

Bleeding (usually minor and easily treated, but occasionally requiring transfusion)-rare  
Catheter migration or dislodgement (may require readjustment)  
Coiling of the stent within the ureter (may cause lower abdominal pain or flank  
pain on urination, urinary frequency, or blood in the urine)  
Introduction or worsening of infection  
Penetration of adjacent organs (e.g., bowel, gallbladder, or lungs)
