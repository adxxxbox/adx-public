TACE Procedure (Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization)     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### TACE Procedure (Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization)

TACE is a minimally invasive image-guided treatment for liver cancer tumors. This procedure is performed in Intervention Radiology to restrict a tumor's blood supply.

The Interventional Radiologist will insert a femoral artery catheter and guide it to the hepatic artery under fluoroscopy. Both chemotherapy medication and embolization materials are injected into the blood vessels that lead to the tumor.

**The interventional Radiologist will possibly inject:**

Contrast Dye.

Small embolic particles that are coated with chemotherapeutic agents; they are injected selectively into an artery directly supplying a tumor with blood.

Materials (either metal coils or special gels) that physically block the blood vessels feeding the tumor.

**Indication:** Malignant lesions in the liver.

Goal: To shrink or eradicate liver tumors by targeting them precisely and blocking their blood flow.

**Anesthesia**  
Like the Y90 procedure, most of these TACE cases are done under conscious sedation by radiology staff RNs trained in giving Midazolam and possible Demerol or Fentanyl.

Our anesthesia services are requested if the patient cannot remain still. For us, this is a basic anesthesia procedure done in Intervention Radiology. We usually intubate and maintain muscle relaxation. An A-Line is not indicated. After extubation, the patient goes to PACU.

**Anesthetic:**  
General/ETT  
Most of these are just conscious sedation without anesthesia services being involved.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Yes, no movement is recommended. Also, you will be asked multiple times to “Stop Ventilation” during injections for image taking, so you do not want the patient breathing. Same principle as an “Aortogram Runoff”.  
**Duration:**1-3 hours  
**IV Access:** 20G  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**Positioning:** Supine with arms tucked  

**Possible Complications:**  
Hemorrhage-very rare.  
Vascular Injury..  
Pseudoaneurysm at the Femoral Artery puncture site.  
Contrast dye allergic reaction.  
GI ulceration.  
Symptomatic hypothyroidism may result from the highly retained iodine load of the contrast.  
Cholecystitis  

Induced tumor necrosis in more than 50% of these patients; the resulting necrosis releases cytokines and other inflammatory mediators into the bloodstream.

A self-limiting postembolization syndrome of pain, fever, and malaise may occur due to hepatocyte and tumor necrosis.

Transaminases may elevate 100-fold, and a leukemoid reaction is not uncommon.

**More Notes:**  
Most tumors within the liver are supplied by the hepatic artery, so arterial embolization preferentially interrupts the tumor's blood supply and stalls growth until collateral neovascularization can occur.

Secondly, specific targeted administration of chemotherapy allows for delivery of a higher dose to the tumor while simultaneously reducing systemic exposure, which is typically the dose limiting factor.

To reduce the likelihood of significant hepatic toxicity, chemoembolization is usually restricted to a single lobe or major branch of the hepatic artery at one time.

The patient may be brought back after 1 month, once toxicities and abnormal chemistries have resolved, to complete the procedure in the opposite lobe. Retreatment of new lesions may be necessary, if patients fulfill the original eligibility criteria.
