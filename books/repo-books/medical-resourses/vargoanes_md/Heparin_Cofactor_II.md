### Heparin Cofactor II

HCII is a plasma protein that inhibits thrombin rapidly in the presence of dermatan sulfate, heparin sulfate, or heparin (prevents clotting).  
  
A deficiency is associated with thromboembolic events.  
  
Some studies revealed that heterozygous HCII deficiency is as prevalent among healthy subjects as it is among patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT).  
  
Decreased HCII levels (40-50% of normal) have been reported in patients with preeclampsia.  
  
**Heterozygous HCII Deficiency**  
Some literature states that it does NOT appear to be an important risk factor for venous thromboembolism and appears to be equally prevalent in people with or without venous thromboembolism.  
Individuals who completely lack HCII have NOT been identified.  
  
**Incidence:** Very rare, < 1%.  
  
**Treatment:** Heparin cofactor II deficient plasma.  
It is manufactured from pooled normal human plasma depleted of heparin cofactor II using antibodies directed to heparin cofactor II.
