### Hemoglobin Goals During CABG

The Hemoglobin ALWAYS drops due to hemodilution and blood loss.  
  
**Hemodilution (Rationale for modest fluid restriction).** 1L crystalloid causes a 17% reduction in Hb.  
1L of crystalloid decreases the Hb from 12g/dL to 10g/dL.  
The patient will receive at least 1 Liter of crystalloid from a primed CPB machine.  
Crystalloid from anesthesia 1-2 Liters.  
Thus, even without accounting for blood loss, a patient’s Hb can drop significantly.  
  
The standard goal is to keep the Hb above 7.5g/dl prior to terminating cardiopulmonary bypass.  
  
However, The American Society of Anesthesiologists Guidelines  
Indication for blood transfusions.  
Recommended for <6g/dl.  
Rarely needed for >10g/dl.  
For 6-10g/dl, evaluate clinical evidence.  
  
PRBCs should always be on stand-by and Cell Saver collection should be washed and available within 10-15 minutes of weaning from bypass.
