### Initiation of Partial Bypass

Re-dose muscle relaxant and benzodiazepine.  
  
Blood pressure should be maintained. This may be difficult.  
  
Cardiopulmonary bypass is initiated at the surgeon’s order.  
  
Most of the venous blood drains through the venous cannula and tubing and makes its way down to the CPB. It collects in a transparent reservoir bag. From there it will travel to an oxygenator. The oxygenated blood (now considered arterial) will be pumped back through the arterial line and into the aorta, bypassing the heart and lungs.  
  
The heart is still beating at this point. The amount of blood remaining in the heart depends on the flow rate of the bypass machine. At full flow (full bypass) almost all the blood leaves the right atrium.  
  
At a very low flow rate, most of the blood remains in the heart and maintains its normal circulation. This concept is important to understand because it’s used for weaning the patient off bypass at the end of the case.  
  
You will see a change in arterial waveform. Communicate with the perfusionist about turning off the ventilator.
