# Bicitra

**Bicitra (Sodium Bicitrate)**  
**Class:** Urinary alkalinizer  
We usually only use this up in OB/GYN  
**Dose:** 30mLs 10-45 minutes before a scheduled C-section.  
**Onset:** Immediate (for gastric acid neutralization).  
**Peak effect:** few minutes.  
**Anesthesia Indications:** prophylaxis against aspiration for emergency C-sections.  
Bicitra's Active Ingredients: citric acid and sodium citrate.  
Bicitra is a nonparticulate antacid we give 30mLs PO to all of our C-section patients for gastric acid neutralization.  
The efficacy of Bicitra depends on gastric volume and acidity.  
A total of 30 ml of sodium citrate neutralizes 255 ml of hydrochloric acid with a pH of 1.0.  
The effective duration of action of sodium citrate is variable and depends on the rate of gastric emptying, i.e. the pH will remain above 3.0 for a longer period if gastric emptying is delayed.  
Each mL of sodium citrate contains 1 mEq sodium & is equivalent to 1 mEq bicarbonate.  
Produces a rapid rise in the pH value of gastric acid.  
30 mL of Bicitra raises gastric pH >2.5 in 90% of patients.  
Most effective when given within 45 min before anesthesia induction.  
Also used to treat metabolic acidosis from renal tubular acidosis  
**Contraindications:**  
Patients with renal impairment.  
Patients on sodium-restricted diets.  
Use cautiously in patients with cardiac failure, HTN, peripheral & pulmonary edema, toxemia of pregnancy.
