### Corpectomy

A Corpectomy is usually just part of a back procedure. A Corpectomy involves removing a portion of the vertebra and adjacent intervertebral discs for decompression of the spinal cord and spinal nerves. A bone graft with or without a metal plate and screws is used to reconstruct the spine and provide stability.
