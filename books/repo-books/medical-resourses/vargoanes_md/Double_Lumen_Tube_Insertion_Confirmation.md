**Double Lumen Tube Insertion/Confirmation**

_Daniel Perez, CRNA, Kaiser, Orange County California_

**DLT Insertion Instructions**  
Lubricate the DLT  
Insert the tip of the DLT just through the vocal cords.  
Immediately rotate the DLT 90° in the direction of the bronchus that you are aiming to intubate.  
Before advancing the tube, remove the stylet.  
Then advance the DLT until resistance is met.  
(~27 cm depth in females, ~29 cm depth in males)  
Inflate the bronchial (blue) with 1-2 ml of air (Low volume, high pressure)  
Inflate the tracheal side with 5-10 ml of air (High volume, low pressure)  
Auscultate the lungs and manually ventilate while the tracheal and bronchial lumens are selectively clamped and unclamped; this is one technique of determining proper positioning of the double lumen tube

**DLT confirmation of placement**  
A fiberoptic scope is considered the gold standard to confirm proper position of the DLT.  
Recheck placement via fiberoptic scope for each change (positioning change, desaturation).  
In regards to confirmation, the fiberoptic scope is advanced through the tracheal lumen, and adequate positioning of the DLT is determined when the carina is visualized and the inflated blue cuff is observed in the desired position.  
For a proper right side DLT placement, it is necessary to look through the bronchial lumen with the fiberoptic scope to position the lateral slit of the Murphy eye at the site where the right upper lobe branches out.

**Contraindications for DLT:**  
Internal lesion of trachea or main bronchi  
Compression of the trachea or main bronchi by external mass  
Presence of thoracic aortic aneurysm  
Compresses and erodes left main bronchus  
Difficult airway where DL is impossible

**Anesthesia Considerations:**  
Increase risk of aspiration  
Longer to place tube

**Deflate bronchial cuff during the procedure once OLV is no longer needed**

**Confirmation of Placement**  
Auscultation of breath sounds:  
_Inflate tracheal cuff_  
Verify bilateral equal breath sounds  
If breath sounds only present in one lung, both lumens are in same bronchus  
(Deflate cuff & withdrawal 1-2 cm at time until breath sounds are heard bilaterally)  
_Inflate endobronchial cuff_  
Clamp endobronchial lumen and open its lumen cap proximal to cap  
Verify breath sounds in correct lung and absence of breath sounds in the opposite lung  
Verify that breath sounds are equal at the apex of the lung & the lateral lung  
If apex is diminished, withdrawal tube until upper lung sounds return. Verify absence of air leakage through the opposite lumen cap  
_Unclamp the endobronchial lumen and verify_ bilateral breath sounds  
Clamp tracheal lumen and open its cap  
Verify breath sounds on the side opposite the lung with the endobronchial lumen & the absence of breath sounds on either

**When absolute lung separation is needed,** connecting a clamped lumen to an underwater drainage system will show air bubbles if a leak is present

**Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy is essential to verify placement**  
Insert scope through the tracheal lumen. Visualize the carina distally.  
Confirm that the tracheal orifice is within the trachea and not a bronchus, or that the tube is not displaced proximally such that the bronchial cuff fills the trachea.  
Visualize the endobronchial (blue) cuff 1-2 mm beyond the carina. Ensure that cuff is not too proximal or overinflated as to herniate across the carina & obstruct contralateral bronchus.  
Insert scope through the bronchial lumen. Visualize that the tip of the bronchial lumen is unobstructed.

**Left-sided tubes:** visualize LUL bronchus distal to the tube tip.  
**Right-sided tubes:** visualize RUL ventilation port is aligned with the RUL bronchus  
Placement of the tube should be checked and verified again after patient is positioned laterally because DLT will commonly withdraw from the bronchus by 1 cm

**At the end of surgery:**  
Lung separator (DLT clamp, bronchial blocker) should be discontinued & lung inflation with slow breaths achieving a PIP of 30-40 cm H2O

**Left DLT vs Right:**  
When retrieving a DLT for your procedure, always choose a left DLT unless contraindicated.  
Left-sided DLTs are used more frequently as they are significantly easier to place without obstructing the upper lobe bronchus.  
A right DLT includes an orifice along the bronchial tube to align with and ventilate the RUL.
