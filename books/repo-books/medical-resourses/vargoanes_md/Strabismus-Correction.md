### Strabismus Correction

**Strabismus** is also known as “squint-eye” and “crossed-eye.” It is a condition in which the eyes are not properly aligned with each other. The extraocular muscles are either too tight or loose. Strabismus may be associated with **amblyopia or Lazy eye.** Strabismus results in an impaired vision in the affected eye, which is due to brain ignoring input from one eye.  
The eye doc either resects by shortening the Lateral rectus muscle, or lengthening the Medial Rectus Muscle.  
**Anesthetic:** General, usually an LMA.  
**Duration:** 30-90 minutes  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 22G is acceptable. A 500mL NS bag with micro drip tubing is popular.  
**Position:** Supine with arms tucked and the patients remains on the same stretcher. Make sure the ETCO2 NC is looped away from the surgical eye. The stretcher is parked 90-180 degrees away from you (unless you are starting out as a general).
