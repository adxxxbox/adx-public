**Pre-operative:** If the patient has any index listed in the chart concerning their OSA/OSAs (Obstructive Sleep Apnea), it is most likely referring to the table below.  
  

Literature states to reserve an ICU bed and overnight stay for kids with severe OSA

**Severity Ranking System Based on Polysomnography**

**Try to determine the severity of any OSA for those patients who have not had a polysomnography.  
You can ask the parent the following issues?  
**Any difficulty breathing with sleep?  
Any symptoms of Apnea  
Sweating while sleeping?  
Mouth breather while awake  
Family history of OSA, sudden death syndrome  
Behvior problems?

**Induction** (for severe OSAS): Consider an inhalation induction in the upright position. Induction the supine position, the genioglossus muscle becomes relaxed and may cause a complete airway obstruction.

With induction (whether upright or supine) perform a jaw thrust maneuver, utilize positive pressure via facemask and immediately insert an appropriate sized oral airway.

**IV Induction:** Perform an IV induction over an inhalation induction when possible. You can control a noncombative, motionless patient’s airway and intubate quicker than inhalation induction.  
  
Warning: Kids with moderate or severs OSAS have an increased sensitivity to opioids.  
Kids with an Sao2 <85% on polysomnography require ½ the morphine needed by those of a non-OSAS patient to achieve the same levels of analgesia.

**Narcotics/sedatives:** Minimize doses and utilize only short acting narcotics/sedatives. The residuals of longer acting narcotics/sedatives may contribute to impede post-operative airway arousal and increase airway obstruction. This could drastically increase their time in the PACU with possible admission for an overnight stay.

Minimal doses of anesthetics, opioids, sedatives and muscle relaxants may STILL contribute to prolonged upper airway muscle relaxation from the excess of diaphragmatic relaxation. This may promote post extubation airway desaturations and pulmonary edema.

**Consider alternatives to narcotics**  
Rectal Tylenol: 30-40mg/kg (post induction or earlier)  
IV Tylenol: 15mg/kg (no greater than 1 gram)  
Toradol: 1mg/kg dose if permitted by surgeon  
Precedex 0.2-1.0 mcg/kg/hr  
Decadron 0.2 - 1.0mg/kg (Max dose 20mg)

_(Decadron study –shows it decreases post-op pain)_  
Consider a nasal airway lubed with lidocaine gel prior to emergence. Patients tolerate a nasal airway longer than an oral airway postoperatively.  
  
**Emergence/extubation:** Awake extubation (eyes open) and patient is using purposeful movement or grabbing for the ETT.  
  

**Post operative period for OSAS Kids  
**Remember- A child with OSAS has an increased risk of postoperative respiratory morbidity from 1-20%. Monitor these kids three hours longer than the non OSA kids before discharge.

**Before discharging your OSA patient from the recovery room**

Do not discharge your OSA patient.

**The ASA guidelines suggests** that OSA patients should be monitored 3 hours longer than the non OSA patients before discharge.  
**  
ASA Guidelines:**  
After being weaned to room air in a non-stimulating environment, monitoring should be continued for a median of 7 hours after any (or last) obstruction episode or desaturations <92%.  
  

ASA practice guidelines recommend the admission of post adenotonsillectomy children < 3 years old. Reserve an ICU bed for the kids with severe OSA.
