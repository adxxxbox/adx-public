### Pneumocephalus (Iatrogenic)

**NOTE:** The manual loss of resistance technique is widely used by anesthesia providers in identifying the epidural space with the injection of 3-5 mLs of air. Many critics now advise the use of PF normal saline instead of air.  
  
Pneumocephalus, a rare consequence of an unintentional dural puncture following by the injection of air into the subarachnoid or epidural space (mostly subarachnoid). Many times there are no signs of a wet tap (cerebrospinal fluid flashback) and the pneumocephalus appears without prediction or preparation of treatment.  
  
The air injected into the subarachnoid space migrates cephalad up into the lateral ventricles or other areas of the brain. It commonly occurs during an epidural or blood patch procedure when the Touhy inadvertently enters the subarachnoid space following with the injection of 3-5 mLs of air while using the loss of resistant techniques.  
  
**Other complications of the injection of air in the subarachnoid space:**  
Spinal cord and nerve root compression  
Retroperitoneal air  
Subcutaneous emphysema  
Venous air embolism  
  
**Signs and Symptoms  
**Sudden bifrontal headache and unilateral pupillary dilationSudden general headache  
Focal neurologic deficits: cranial nerve palsies, hemiparesis, or hemiplegia  
Increased ICP symptoms: vomiting, seizures, lethargy  
Cardiovascular instability may arise depending on the distribution of air  
Possible difficulty breathing  
Possible sudden hypotension  
CT Scan: air density areas within the cranial cavity: subarachnoid and intraventricular air.  
Air may also migrate to the anterior part of the interpeduncular cistern  
  
**Treatment of Pneumocephalus  
**100% Oxygen therapy (NRBM) facilitates denitrogenation and reabsorption of the air  
Surgery if there is a tension pneumocephalus.  
  
Nitrous Oxide during anesthesia: AVOID  
  
**Pneumocephalus is one of the causes a postdural puncture headache (PDPH)  
  
Two causes of postdural puncture headache:**  
CSF fluid leakage (late onset, long lasting)  
Intrathecal air (immediate onset, short duration).  
  
Epidural infusion or blood patch are treatments used to treat PDPH but are ineffective in pneumocephalus-induced headache.  
  
**Pneumocephalus** usually disappears in 3–5 days with reabsorption of the air.
