Shunts, Left-to-Right (Acyanotic) Notes   

### Shunts, Left-to-Right (Acyanotic) Notes

**Two simple facts to remember:**  
Blood normally will follow the path of least resistance.  
The blood flow through the systemic and pulmonary circulations is normally balanced and equal.

**Left-to-Right Shunts**  
Left-to-right shunts are characterized by a "back-leak" of fully oxygenated blood from the left atrium, left ventricle, or aorta to the unoxygenated blood in the right atrium, the right ventricle, or the pulmonary artery.

Because the blood from the left is oxygenated, left-to-right shunt lesions result in having some fully oxygenated blood recirculating through the lungs (Acyanotic).

Unfortunately, left-to-right shunts produce a volume burden on the cardiovascular system. With left to right shunting, the lungs receive the normal volume of the right sided deoxygenated blood, but also some of the fully oxygenated blood that shunts from the systemic side (left). The blood volume and pressure in the pulmonary circulation become abnormally high. This can cause progressive damage to the pulmonary vasculature and gradual development of irreversible pulmonary hypertension.

Increased pulmonary blood flow can lead to CHF and/or failure to thrive (FTT).

If the left-to-right shunt is significant, the increased volume of blood returning from the lungs to the left atrium cause an increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume and left ventricular stroke work by the Frank-Starling mechanism.

The left ventricle eventually will dilate and hypertrophy producing increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure followed by increased left atrial pressure. The final result is damage to the pulmonary vasculature and pulmonary edema from pulmonary venous congestion and left heart failure. The gradual development pulmonary hypertension is irreversible.

Atrial septal defects that exist WITHOUT an increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) cause only mild elevation of right ventricular and pulmonary artery pressure.

A large VSD (larger than the aorta) results in elevated right ventricular and pulmonary artery pressure equal to the pressure in the left ventricle.

**Eisenmenger Syndrome**  
When the pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) exceeds the systemic pressure, the shunting can reverse and now become a right to left shunt. This is bad and will lead to cyanosis!

**Small or large PDA**  
A small PDA does not cause significant elevation of the right ventricular pressure.  
Large PDA can cause elevated right ventricular and pulmonary artery pressure equal to the pressure in the aorta.

**Acyanotic congenital heart disease with left-to-right shunting**

Atrial septal defect (ASD)  
Ventricular septal defect (VSD)  
Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)  
Atrioventricular defect (AVSD)  
Common atrioventricular canal (CAVC) or "endocardial cushion defect"

In VSD and PDA, the direction and magnitude of the shunt depends on the size of the communication and the relative resistance in the pulmonary and systemic circuit.

In ASD and AVSD, the magnitude of the shunt depends largely on relative ventricular compliance (elasticity).

**The hemodynamic consequences of a left to right shunt:**  
↑ LV volume load  
Excessive pulmonary blood flow  
Reduced systemic CO  
↓ Systemic perfusion  
Hypotension  
LV failure  
PHTN  
  
**Remember:** Blood normally will follow the path of least resistance. If you increase PVR, blood is less likely to flow from the left to the right because the pressure gradient is less.

**Anesthesia and Hemodynamic Goals to decrease Left-to Right simple shunting:**

Maintain or ↓ SVR

Normal or slight ↑ PVR (Hypoventilate)

Minimize the FiO2 and avoiding hyperventilation (PaCO2 between 40-50 mmHg).  
↓ FiO2 with hypoxic gas mixture  
Inhaled CO2 (CO2 increases PVR)  
  
Avoidance of air bubbles in IV lines to prevent paradoxical emboliRemain vigilant for the way that oxygen and CO2 effects pulmonary vessel tone. (increased CO2 increases PVR, decreased FiO2 increases PVR- attempt to maintain the patient at their “baseline” levels of CO2 and O2)

**Propofol with induction in left-to-right shunts**

Patients with left-to right shunting tolerate propofol well as long as metabolic acidosis is not excessive.  
Propofol is not advised for induction for the right-to-left shunts.  
  
**Induction with a left-to-right shunt**  
Little effect on IV induction  
Left to Right (volatile): little effect on inhalation induction  
  
With simple shunting, avoid right to left shunting from large increases in PVR > SVR. Seen with desaturations (cyanotic).  
Minimizing the pressure gradient between the SVR and PVR limits left to right shunting and pulmonary engorgement.  
  
**Factors that DECREASE PVR (increase Left-to-right shunting).**  
Increased oxygen  
Decreased CO2  
Increased pH (alkalosis)  
Decreased sympathetic stimulation

**More Notes  
**A cardiac shunt is an abnormal communication between the pulmonary and systemic circulation due to a structural defect of the heart and/or great blood vessels.  
Some textbooks may refer them as “lesions.”  
  
Kids with a cardiogenic heart defect (CHD) have a communication (or multiple communications) between the two sides of the heart (septal defects or a PDA) that allows a shunt to exist.
