### Calcium Chloride (CaCl2) Precautions

**Total calcium:** 2.2-2.6 mmol/l or (9-10.5 mg/dl)  
**Ionized calcium:** 1.1-1.4 mmol/l or (4.5-5.6 mg/dl)  
  
Calcium levels are reduced by hemofiltration, chelation by preservatives in banked blood, or by hemofiltration. Common practice among anesthesia providers is to bolus with 1 gram of calcium chloride (CaCl2). However, many experienced providers begin more conservatively with half that dose (500 mg). Profound hypotension may result from a bolus of 1 gram.  
  
CaCl2 must never be given immediately before or after removal of the cross-clamp. The administration of any form of calcium during that vulnerable period may exacerbate reperfusion injury. 1 gram of CaCl2 (or 3-5 mg/kg) is usually sufficient to normalize serum ionized calcium levels.  
  
2 grams of CaCl2 may cause hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia can cause increased cardiac muscle contractility and irritability, ECG changes, decreased heart rate, conduction blockade in the heart, and hypertension.
