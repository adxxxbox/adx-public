### Heller Myotomy Laparoscopic or Robotic

**Heller Myotomy:** A minimally invasive procedure that opens the tight lower esophageal sphincter (LES)  
**Indications:** Achalasia

If you are still in anesthesia training you are lucky, because in ‘olden days’ these cases were difficult: involving a DLT with one lung ventilation. Now they are a much easier anesthesia case. This surgery is for achalasia. This procedure weakens the muscles at the GE junction, allowing the LES valve to remain open.  
  
**Achalasia:** A disorder of the esophagus characterized by a progressive inability to swallow solids and liquids.  
  
**Surgery**  
The esophagus and stomach are identified and freed from the surrounding tissue. The external muscles of the esophagus and stomach are carefully divided (loosened) for a distance of at least six centimeters up the esophagus and two centimeters down towards the stomach. Great care is taken to avoid cutting the inner lining. The opening of the esophageal muscles is called a myotomy.

The tip of the stomach is then wrapped around behind the esophagus (this is called a fundoplication) and sewn to the edges of the myotomy both to keep the myotomy open and to prevent any GE reflux that may be caused by a newly less restricted LES valve.  
Sometimes a “Toupet Procedure” is done instead of a fully wrapped fundoplication. With a toupet, the fundus is only wrapped about 270 degrees around the esophagus.  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT and RSI because the patient has very bad GERD.  
**OGT:** Yes, the surgeon will want the stomach decompressed. There may be more volume aspirated above the GE junction within the esophagus than what is remaining in the stomach. The OGT is usually pulled out prior to the EGD.    
**Duration:** 1.5-3 hours  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**Positioning:  
Robotic:** Reverse Trendelenburg, arms tucked and bed rotated 45-90 degrees.  
**Regular Laparoscopic** (not robotic): Reverse Trendelenburg, lithotomy and arms tucked.  
**EGD:** Yes; although sometimes the GE junction is actually too restricted for the endoscope to pass. The surgeon may ask you to temporarily deflate the patient’s cuff.  
**Neosynephrine Drip:** Yes, because the patient will be in reverse Trendelenburg. Make sure you connect it before they tuck the patient’s arms. It’s a real pain to connect it after the arms are tucked.  
  
**Possible complications**  
Damage to the lung, spleen, stomach, esophagus or liver.  
Esophageal or gastric perforations  
Post op infection  
Basic anesthesia complications
