### Labor Pain per Phases of Labor

  
_Edited by Ryan Smith CRNA_

Labor can be divided into 3 phases and the pain source in each phase is a little different.  
  
**First Phase (Early Latent Labor) goal: Block T10-L1  
**Longest and the least intense.  
**Duration:** Can be from several hours to several weeks-often without noticeable or bothersome contractions.  
Cervix only dilates to to 3cm and will efface (thin out).  
Pain primarily comes from the contraction of the uterus and dilation of the cervix.  
Afferents with peripheral terminals are in the cervix and lower uterine segment and NOT the uterine body-as written in the past.  
Pain in this stage is transmitted primarily by slower C fibers to the level of **T10-L1** .  
An easy reference point is the belly button which is typically at the sensation level of T10.  
  
**Phase 2** **(Active Labor)** **Stretching the Perineum** **\- ouch  
**Usually lasts from 2 to 3.5 hours  
Cervix dilates from 3-7cm  
**Contractions** : more concentrated and painful.  
**Duration:** stronger and longer-lasting 40 to 60 seconds.  
**Frequency:** Q 3-4 minutes, though the pattern may not be regularThe uterine contractions and cervical dilation continue but stretching of the vagina is added.  
  
**Symptoms of Phase 2 without an epidural or pain relief:  
**Increasing pain and discomfort with contractions.  
Increasing backache.  
Leg discomfort or heaviness.  
Fatigue.  
Increasing bloody show.  
Rupture of the membranes if they haven’t already.  
  
**Pain during for the 2 nd phase of labor:** Transmitted by the same afferents activated during the first phase of labor but with additional afferents that innervate the cervix (vaginal surface) vagina and perineum. The additional afferents course through the pudendal nerve at S2-S4 and are somatic. Pain in this phase is transmitted by C fibers.  
  
A pudendal nerve block or extension of the epidural blockade from **T10-S4** during the first phase of labor may be beneficial.  
  
**Phase 3** **(Transitional Advanced Labor)  
Cervix is 7-10cm  
****Duration:** Shortest, generally15 minutes to 1 hour (sometimes up to three hours).  
**Contractions** : become very strong and last 60 to 90 seconds long. May be  
spaced only about two or three minutes apart.  
**  
Symptoms of Phase 3 without an epidural or pain relief:**  
Strong pressure in the lower back and/or perineum.  
Rectal pressure.  
Increase in bloody show as capillaries in the cervix rupture.  
Feeling very warm and sweaty or chilled and shaky.  
Crampy legs that may tremble uncontrollably.  
Nausea and/or vomiting.  
A tightening sensation of throat or chest.  
  
Pain is derived from the stretching of the vagina and opening of the pelvis for delivery.  
Pain in this stage is carried by C and A fibers and the patient feels a lot more pressure in this stage from the opening of the pelvis and baby’s head moving into the pelvis.  
  
Epidural anesthesia is usually desired in the very late phase 1 of labor or early phase 2. This is very effective at controlling the patient’s progress in pain.  
A T10 level is adequate for most laboring patients as this will block C fibers in both stages but most providers aim for a **T8 or T6** level just to ensure adequate pain control.  
  
Instead of administering a certain dose just for the early latent labor and then another certain dose just for active labor, we usually bolus a certain volume of our preferred local anesthetic after the negative test dose, followed with a continuous infusion until delivery.  
If the patient starts to hurt more as labor progresses, we give a little more above the continuous infusion – we call this a “top off.”  
  
**Tips  
**Information is key especially in first time mothers when anxiety can be an issue. I explain the pain relief expected from the epidural to all of my patients. An epidural can do a very good job of alleviating the pain in the early stages of labor but once the sensation of pressure takes over, the epidural will not block that sensation nor do we really want it to because this will tell the patient when it's time to push and help her push. Most patients understand and do very well.  
  
I also explain to my patients that the epidural works by gravity and describe it as water in a jar, as long as the jar stays flat and the water is remains motionless, they stay comfortable. If they turn to one side or sit up- the water moves and they hurt. Most understand this well and are glad to oblige.  
  
Once the patient transitions to active labor and the sensation of pressure takes over the epidural will be less likely to control all of the patient’s pain. At this point it is common to be called to " top up " a patient for delivery. Stronger local anesthetics such as 2% lidocaine or 0.5% marcaine are typically used to get these patients comfortable but keep in mind these strong local anesthetics can also decrease the patient’s ability to push effectively.
