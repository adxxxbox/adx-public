### AICD and Pacemaker Notes

**Biotronik:** 1-800-547-5433  
**Boston Scientific:** 1-800-CARDIAC (227-3422)  
**Medtronic:** 1-800-633-8766  
**St. Jude:** 1-800-PACEICD (722-3423)  
 

**Quick Review:**  
All ICDs contain a pacemaker (has pacemaker functions built in), but pacemakers don’t have a defibrillator function.

**_Current pacemakers, with their advanced noise-filtration techniques, are fairly resistant to common EMI sources like the Bovie (electrocautery)._** 

**Never place a magnet on a pacemaker**    
Magnets were not designed to “turn off” pacemakers, but rather, to test battery life.  
  
**When a magnet is placed on a pacemaker:**  
When a magnet is applied to a pacemaker, it is switched to an ASYNCHRONOUS  pacing mode at a programmed AV delay and a fixed magnet rate, depending on the manufacturer, device model, and the status of the battery

The programmed mode DDD switches to DOO  
VVI switches to VOO  
AAI switches to AOO  
The rate response feature is switched to 'OFF' on magnet application in pacemakers.

**Asynchronous:** Delivers stimuli at a fixed rate, independent of any atrial or ventricular activity; this type is now rarely used except to initiate or terminate some tachycardias.  
  
60% of pacemakers will convert to a high-rate (80-100 bpm) asynchronous mode.  
25% will convert to asynchronous mode at the programmed rate.  
15% will respond with 60-100 asynchronous beats.  
The only way to determine what actually occurs with magnet placement is to consult the manufacturer.

**Removing the magnet from a Pacemaker**  
In almost all pacemakers, removal of the magnet causes the device to revert to pacing at the normal preprogrammed rate with the exception of Sorin pacemakers.

Removing a magnet can rarely cause pacemaker mediated tachycardia (PMT), which results from retrograde P waves that occur during asynchronous slower-than-intrinsic pacing. These retrograde P waves can be picked up by dual sensing pacemakers (DDD, VDD). To correct, re-apply the magnet and remove again.

 **More Notes:**  
Most pacemakers and ICDs have built-in magnetic reed switches that are designed to switch 'ON' or 'OFF' circuitry in response to magnets. Some of the newer devices are equipped with alternative technologies like giant magnetosensitive resistors (GMRs), Hall-effect sensors, or telemetry coils that respond to magnets.
