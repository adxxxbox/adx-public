### Cardiac Stents and Surgery

Quick facts:  
**Drug Eluting Stents (DES):**  
No elective surgery for 365 days  
On Plavix 1 year and 81mg ASA for life.

**Bare Metal Stents**:  
No elective surgery for 6 weeks  
On Plavix 1 month and 81mg ASA for life.  
  
All stent patients should see a Cardiologist pre-operatively for “start/stop” recommendations for Plavix /Brilinta /Effient and aspirin. This is NOT an anesthesia decision.

Patient must be OFF Plavix (Clopidogrel) 75mg for 5-7 days before surgery and CONTINUE their aspirin. However, I’ve seen some surgeons take their patients off their aspirin and restart it a day after surgery.

**For anesthesia:** Keep their BP up and adequate hydration to prevent a prothrombotic state within the coronaries.  
After stent placement, it is recommend to post-pone all elective procedures for which there is a significant risk of bleeding until dual-antiplatelet therapy is completed.

Except for neurosurgical and urologic procedures, **ASA** should continue and NOT be stopped in the peri-operative period in any patient who has ever had a coronary stent.

81 mg of aspirin is protective and poses minimal operative bleeding risk.

  
**Why the big deal with Cardiac Stents and Surgery?**  
Patients with Intracoronary stents having noncardiac surgery are at increased risk of stent thrombosis.   
**Stent thrombosis:** Up to a 40% mortality rate.  The survivors usually have a severely dysfunctional heart.

Over time, an intracoronary stent is covered with smooth endothelium resulting in lowered risk. Dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) effectively reduces the risk of stent thrombosis to 1%.

Plavix (Clopidogrel) and ASA are administered concomitantly. Effient or Brilinta is sometimes substituted for Plavix.

**The Dilemma:** If Plavix if discontinued relatively soon after the placement of coronary stents, there is now a significant mortality risk during noncardiac surgery for MI.  
However, if the Plavix is continued, it can increase the risk of intra-op bleeding and also prevent us from performing regional anesthesia.

**Any surgery soon after the placement of a stent is worrisome:**  
Because stent endothelialization may not yet be complete at the time of an upcoming surgery, abrupt discontinuation of Plavix and aspirin combined with the prothrombotic state induced by surgery increases the risk of acute perioperative stent thrombosis and abrupt vessel closure, leading to significant morbidity and mortality.  
  
Holding Plavix for 5-7 days before the planned surgery is usually sufficient to substantially reduce bleeding risks. Aspirin is continued. The cardiologist, and NOT the surgeon almost always make this recommendation.  
 

**Current consensus recommendations for elective surgery following coronary intervention are as follows:**

1. Delay surgery for at least 2 weeks post POBA (plain old balloon angioplasty) to endovascular stenting. No Plavix is required.

2\. Continue Aspirin whenever possible during the surgery.

3. Surgery with low bleeding risks should continue Plavix. Ex. Cataracts; EGD.

4. Delay surgery for 4-6 weeks after bare metal stents when holding Plavix for patients considered at least moderate bleeding risks.

5. Delay surgery for at least 6 and preferably 12 months after drug-eluting stents when holding Plavix for patients considered to be moderate bleeding risks.

6.  Resume Plavix as soon as possible post-operatively with a 300-600 mg bolus (ideally day 1 post-op).

**Treatment for surgical bleeding when off Plavix:**    
Be prepared to treat potential bleeding problems with platelets (unless Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura or TTP has developed), fresh frozen plasma, and blood transfusions. 

**For surgeries with high bleeding potentials:**  
Preoperative platelets should improve hemostasis.  In those instances where a few days of delay before surgery is acceptable, the various forms of the platelet function assay test (PFA) can help gauge the level of platelet inhibition and aid in the timing of surgery.

**DES (drug-eluting stent)**  
Plavix 75 mg daily should be given for at least 12 months if patients are not at high risk of bleeding. Elective surgery should be postponed if the duration between DES placement and noncardiac surgery is less than six months. Drug-eluting stents (DES) face the challenge of balancing the risks of bleeding vs. perioperative stent thrombosis (ST).

**BMS (bare metal stent)**  
Plavix should be given for a minimum of 1 month and ideally up to 12 months (unless the patient is at increased risk of bleeding; then it should be given for a minimum of 2 weeks). BMS stents have a higher rate of re-stenosis.

Current studies also recommend postponing all elective procedures for which there is a significant risk of bleeding until dual-antiplatelet therapy is completed.

Aspirin is continued throughout the perioperative period, except in instances where surgery is performed in a closed space (intracranial surgery, posterior chamber of the eye as in a vitrectomy, or a spinal surgery in the medullary canal).
