### PCEA Modes

  
_Dr. Alyson Eastep, CRNA  Summerton, SC  
PCEA (Patient Controlled Epidural Analgesia)_

**Contents:** Your infusion mixture is in an IV bag produced by pharmacy.  
Usually a local anesthetic mixed with without or without a narcotic.  
**Example:** Fentanyl 2mcg/mL with Bupivacaine 0.0625% in 250 mL bag.  
**Basal Rate:** (Sometimes referred to as background infusion)  
The base rate you want continuously infused over the hour.  
Around 8-12 mL/hr is a common basal rate.  
**  
Demand**  
The small bolus dose that you permit the patient to receive at certain intervals when they press their red hand button. This mode results in a more constant analgesia and reduces anesthesia provider having to manually arrive to administer top off doses.  
Common dose is 4mL Q 15 minutes, with a continuous Basal Rate of 8 mL/hr.  
(there are so many different cocktails)  
  
**Lockout:** The preset time interval between **Demand** boluses (between previous and future bolus).  
**Ex. Say a Lockout time is 15 minutes:** No matter how many times the patient presses the pain button for their " **Demand** " (small bolus), she will only receive a dose every 15 minutes. The lockout time prevents the patient from abusing it or over dosing.  
  
**Example Setting:Basal Rate:** 12 mLs**Demand:** 2 mLs**Lockout:** 15 minutesSo with above settings, the most a patient may receive hourly is 20 mLs  
12 mLs + (Q 15 minutes x 2 mLs).
