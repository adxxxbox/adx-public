### Epidural Test Dose - Containing Epinephrine

Epinephrine is used in test doses to serve as a marker for intravenous injection catheter. This would indicate that the epidural catheter was unintentionally threaded in a blood vessel.  
  
As already stated in other pertaining files, the epinephrine is usually mixed with 1.5% Lidocaine in a 5 mL test dose vial and part of the epidural kit.  
So drawing up 3 mLs in a syringe gives you 15mcg of epinephrine and 45mg of lidocaine. How simple is that?  
  
3-5 mLs of 1:200,000 epinephrine solution (15-25 mcg) is commonly added to a local anesthetic (usually lidocaine) to make sure the epidural catheter was NOT unintentionally inserted into a blood vessel within or near the epidural space. The lidocaine is for assessing a subarachnoid epidural placement.  
The veins in the epidural space are engorged in a pregnant woman. There is a much higher rate of an epidural catheter being unintentionally inserted intravascularly in pregnant woman than a nonpregnant woman.  
**NOTE:** The Army taught (at least in the early 90s) that the veins in the epidural space were more engorged in the seated than in the lateral position, and therefore more vulnerable to inadvertent vascular puncture.)  
  
**Controversial and conflicting literature with epinephrine used in test doses** There is conflicting literature concerning epinephrine as being an unreliable indicator of intravascular injection in a laboring mother.  
Epinephrine in test doses is associated with “false positives” and “false negatives” when assessing for unintentional intravascular insertion of an epidural needle.  
Despite the literature, epinephrine is commonly added to lidocaine in test doses  
  
**The Epinephrine vial that comes in your neuraxial kits  
**_Do not get the weak 1:200,000 Epinephrine (5mcg/mL) supplied in the Epidural Trays confused with the strong 1:1,000 Epinephrine (1mg/mL) vials we see in the Spinal Trays and operating rooms._**Spinal Tray Epinephrine:** aqueous 1:1000 solution (1 mg/ml) in an ampule of 1 ml, totaling 1mg or 1,000 mcg.  
**Epidural Tray Epinephrine:** 1:200,000 (0.005 mg/ml or 5 mcg/ml) in an ampule of 5 ml, totaling 0.025 mg or 25 micrograms.  
  
**Epinephrine**  
1:200,000 Epinephrine commonly is added to the Lidocaine  
1:200,000 Epinephrine = 5mcg/mL (this is weak concentration of epinephrine)  
Typically 3-5 mLs (15-45mcg) of epinephrine is the common range  
A 1:200,000 Epinephrine vial containing 5 mLs comes in most epidural kits.  
  
**Effects of low dose Epinephrine on the cardiovascular system  
Remember** : 15-45mcg of 1,200,000 of epinephrine is a very low dose as compared to the 1;1,000 epinephrine we administer to a patient during a crisis.  
  
When epinephrine is unintentionally administered intravascularly under normal conditions, it should naturally increase the HR and BP.  
**  
Cardiovascular effects from intravascular injection of a test dose containing epinephrine.**  
HR should increase from a mean of **80** ± 15 to **110** ± 15 beats per minute  
Should occur within 23 ± 6 seconds following the injection  
Returned to baseline within 32 ±33 seconds  
  
**Simply Stated:  
**An increase in heart rate of 20-30 bpm within 45 seconds  
An increase in systolic blood pressure of between 15 and 25 mmHg  
  
**False Positive Test Dose (Intravascular) for a Properly Placed Epidural Catheter  
**A positive HR response to an epinephrine-containing test dose may occur up to 20% of patients - _of when the catheter is actually **NOT** intravascular_ . This may result in removing a properly placed epidural catheter followed by repeating the epidural procedure.  
  
**False Negative Test Dose for an Epidural Catheter Accidentally Placed Intravascularly  
**_Sometimes there is NO cardiovascular change with an intravascular injection_An increase in HR is observed in only 50% of laboring women for INCORRECTLY placed epidural catheters (literature varies). This obviously means that the other 50% of laboring women will NOT have an increased HR after the intravascular injection of epinephrine.  
This is why a false negative test dose with an incorrectly placed epidural catheters may be missed.  
This is one of the two main reasons literature states that each epidural bolus should only be 3-5 mLs and treat each bolus as a test dose.  
This is a reason why epinephrine used in test doses for the diagnosis of accidental intravascular injections remains controversial.  
Always assess other possible symptoms - especially for neural toxicity.  
  
**Is your patient on a Beta Blocker?**  
Parturients who are being treated with **β-blocking** drugs may **NOT** show tachycardia, even when the epinephrine is administered intravascularly.  
  
**It is important to look at the big picture and assess other signs (neurotoxicity, etc.) rather than just focusing on the HR when giving any test dose.  
  
Is your patient experiencing symptoms of local anesthetic toxicity?  
Ask your patient if they are experiencing:**  
Ringing in their ears  
Metal taste in their mouth  
Tongue numbness  
Light headedness  
Disorientation  
Blurred vision  
**Note:** Did you ever bolus your EGD patient with100 mg of lidocaine to blunt their gag reflex before administering propofol? They usually inform you of the metallic mouth taste and ringing in their ears.  
  
**Other controversial or unfavorable literature concerning epinephrine-containing test doses  
**Calimaran et al (Anesth Analg 2003;96:1167) suggested that epinephrine in a test dose may cause a decreased mobility at 60 minutes.  
  
**Intravenous Epinephrine and Uterine Blood Flow**  
Intravascular epinephrine may cause a _transient decline in uterine blood flow as a result of α-adrenergic receptor-mediated constriction of the uterine arteries_ but it is transient and _comparable to the decrease that occurs during a uterine contraction.  
_In healthy parturients, any transient effect of epinephrine on uterine blood flow likely represents a less severe insult than systemic local anesthetic toxicity.  
  
**Patients with Severe Hypertension  
**An epinephrine-containing test dose may not be appropriate in parturients with _severe hypertension or uteroplacental insufficiency._
