Ureteral Reimplantation   

### Ureteral Reimplantation

Ureteral reimplantation surgery changes the way an abnormally positioned ureter connects with the bladder.  
Normally, the ureter enters the muscular bladder in such a way that urine is permitted to enter the bladder without reflux (backflow).  
When the ureter enters the bladder abnormally, the muscle backing of the bladder doesn't completely cover the ureter and urine flows back toward the kidney. This condition is called **vesicoureteral reflux**.

This procedure is surgically similar to a Pyeloplasty, except the surgeon is disconnecting and reconnecting the bad refluxing ureter to the bladder and not to the kidney.

So the end of the ureter is surrounded by bladder muscle in this new position, which prevents urine from refluxing toward the bladder.

_For Anesthesia, this is basically a long easy stable case in the supine position with usually little or no blood loss._ _Little to no narcotics are needed after a caudal block._  
  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
**Airway Issues:** none  
**Regional:** Caudal  
**Narcotics:** Little to none- if there is a caudal block.  
This is a painful procedure without a caudal.  
Hydromorphone 0.01-0.02 mg/kg titrated.  
**Nitrous:** OK to use  
**Muscle relaxation:** usually  
**Antibiotics:** Yes, sometimes the surgeon will want you to wait in administering the antibiotics until he gets a urine sample. Check with the surgeon.  
**Duration** 2-5 hours  
**Position:** Supine, and you will assist sliding the patient down towards the middle of the bed. Protect the ETT. Apply extra padding where needed due to the duration of the case.  
**IV Access:** 22G  
**EBL:** Minimal**  
Hydration: 4:2:1 (below is just a common reference)  
**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg  
  
**Post op:** High pain levels if there was not a caudal.

**Possible Complications  
**Bleeding  
Infection  
Hernia  
Damage to tissues or organs  
Persistent leakage of urine  
Blockage of the ureter

**More Notes**  
Obstruction of the UPJ can be caused by congenital abnormalities like horseshoe kidney, fibrous scarring due to a stone, a previous operation, or a stone that gets impacted in the upper part of ureter. This can cause damage to kidney tissue and eventually lead to pain, stones, infection, high blood pressure, and deterioration of kidney function and failure.

Over the past several years, robotic pyeloplasty was developed to give the same high success rate obtained with open pyeloplasty (>90%) while avoiding the large incision and associated pain and morbidity.

Although different types of pyeloplasty operations have been described, the ultimate goal is to remove the strictured portion of the UPJ, fashion the renal pelvis, and attach it to the ureter in a way to allow for easy drainage of urine down the ureter. There are different ways to approach the kidney to perform the operation. These include a flank incision, subcostal (under the rib) incision, trans-abdominal approach, or even sometimes through an incision in the back.
