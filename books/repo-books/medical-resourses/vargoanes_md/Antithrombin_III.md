Antithrombin III    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Antithrombin III(AT III), a clotting inhibitor  
(Heparin accelerates its inhibition of clot formation)

Antithrombin I-IV originated in early studies. However, only AT III and possibly AT I are medically significant.  
Antithrombin III (ATIII) is a non-vitamin K-dependent protease.  
It inhibits coagulation by neutralizing thrombin (factors IIa, IXa, Xa), thus fibrinogen will not be converted to fibrin.

**Heparins potentiate antithrombin III up to 4,000 times**  
LMWH and Heparin potentiate antithrombin III thus preventing coagulation.  
Heparin POTENTIATES the activity of Antithrombin III by 2,000 - 4,000 times, leading to a risk increased bleeding.  
  
**Plasma half-life of Antithrombin III:** Around 3 days.  
  
**Antithrombin III deficiency:** May result in venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
