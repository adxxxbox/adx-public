Norepinephrine (Levophed) - Dosing    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Norepinephrine (Levophed) - Dosing

Norepinephrine = NE  
Intraoperative hypotension = IOH  
  
**Concentrations for continuous infusion:  
**4 mg of NE in a 250 mL bag of NS or D5W = 16 mcg/mL  
8 mg of NE in a 500 mL bag of NS or D5W = 16 mcg/ mL  
8 mg of NE in a 250 mL bag of NS or D5W = 32 mcg/mL  
  
**Continuous infusion ranges:  
**2-35 mcg/min or  
0.01-0.3 mcg/kg/min  
**  
Maximum doses for refractory shock:  
**80 to 250 mcg/minute or  
2 to 3.3 mcg/kg/minute  
**  
Single diluted bolus for IOH:  
**2-4 mcg (diluted to 4 mcg/mL)  
  
**Low dose of NE (< 4 mcg/min) continuous infusion:**  
Beta actions are predominant  
↑ Venous relaxation  
↑ Cardiac contractility (positive inotrope)  
Little to no chronotropic effect  
  
**Larger dose of NE (> 5 mcg/min) continuous infusion:**  
↑ Arterial and venous vasoconstriction  
↑ Cardiac contractility (positive inotrope)  
↓ HR (baroreceptor triggered)
