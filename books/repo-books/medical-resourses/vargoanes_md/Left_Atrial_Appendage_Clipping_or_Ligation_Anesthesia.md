### Left Atrial Appendage Clipping or Ligation Anesthesia

Refer to _“Left Atrial Appendage Clipping or Ligation”_ for the details of this procedure.  
\- There is no standard of anesthesia management for this novel procedure as not many medical institutions are performing it.  
\- Below is an example of what the anesthesia providers do at one institution that performs them.**  
  
Warning:  
**\- Some anesthesia providers have reported severe hypertension episodes when the patient’s chest gets insufflated.  
\- Have dobutamine and norepinephrine primed and connected.  
\- Other anesthesia providers have not reported severe hypotension and manage this procedure as a traditional thoracoscopy involving one-lung ventilation.  
  
**Anesthesia Management:  
Preparation and equipment:  
**\- Arterial line  
\- 2 IVs  
\- TEE  
\- Left DLT (to deflate left lung)  
\- Pressors- Dobutamine and Norepinephrine  
\- Ten cc syringe of diluted norepinephrine  
\- Albumin  
\- Surgeon’s regimen consisting of steroids, colchicine and NSAID medications - ask the surgeon ahead of time.  
  
**Fluid management:**  
Ask the surgeon.  
  
**Albumin and cardiac output: (optional)  
**\- Consider infusing one 250 mL bottle (5%) when the patient’s cardiac output is normal prior to chest inflation.  
\- Consider infusing two bottles if the patient’s cardiac output is compromised.  
  
**Position:**  
\- A patient positioning device (usually pneumatic) will elevate the patient's left side to create more room for the left thoracoscopy (patient still supine).  
  
**Chest insufflation:  
**\- Collaboration between the cardiac surgeon and anesthesia provider is essential because the insufflation may cause severe episodes of severe hypotension.  
\- Before the surgeon insufflates the chest, consider starting your pressors at a low dose and titrating as needed.  
\- If pressors become insufficient to maintain BP, inform the surgeon.  
\- The surgeon may periodically decrease insufflation until the patient becomes stable.  
  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**EBL:** Minimal  
  
**Possible complications:  
**\- Bleeding  
\- Cardiac arrest  
\- Abnormal heart rhythm  
\- Infection  
\- Pericardial effusion
