Tonsillectomy and Adenoidectomy (T & A) Anesthesia   

### Tonsillectomy and Adenoidectomy (T & A) Anesthesia

Tonsillectomy is defined as surgical excision of the palatine tonsils.

T & A – removing the palatine tonsils and the adenoid.

This is a very common procedure and there are so many variations to manage the anesthesia among practitioners.  
Below is a basic method since there is no ONE standard practice.  
  
**Most Popular Indications:**  
Airway obstruction  
Recurrent throat infections

**Your goal for this case is to:**  
Keep the patient motionless.  
Avoid hypertension to help limit bleeding.  
Safely manage the child’s airway that is prone to obstruction from OSA and laryngeal spasm.  
Avoid PONV and post op pain as much as possible.  
  
**Pre-op evaluation**  
**Labs:** Typically CBC, platelet level, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and bleeding time.

**CXR and ECG:** not required unless there was a recurrent pneumonia, bronchitis, URI, or heart disease.

**History of OSA?** Some literature states that a child diagnosed with severe OSA should have an IV induction. I find that rare.  
Always further assess the severity of the OSA and determine if the patient may need to be admitted.  
  
**Contraindications of Tonsillectomy  
**Anemia Hb <10g  
Acute infection  
Abnormal coags  
Bleeding diathesis; leukemia, purpura, aplastic anemia, hemophilia  
Overt or submucous cleft palate  
Children < 3 years  
Uncontrolled systemic disease  
During menstruation

**Anesthesia:** General/ETT -preferably a cuffed oral rae.

(Cuffed ETT to avoid blood entering the trachea)

Also, the surgeon will pack of the supraglottic area to prevent spillage of blood to the stomach and trachea.  

**Induction:** Pre-oxygenate, (RSI) IV if the child is old enough to tolerate an IV in pre-op.**IV is preferred with severe OSA.** Some patients can't tolerate a supine position may sit upright on the OR table when the mask is applied.  
**Inhalation:** Nitrous/O2 70:30 with high % Sevoflurane or No Nitrous with 8% Sevoflurane and 100% O2.  
Mask ventilation may be difficult due to OSA, don’t hesitate to insert an oral airway while someone is inserting the IV.  
**FIO2:** Lower to <30% when electrocautery or laser is being used.  
There are many surgical methods utilized to remove tonsils that are of little risk. Always check with the surgeon.

**Intubation:** Secure the ETT to midline and do no secure the ETT with a lot of tape because the EENT surgeon will be manipulated it.

Most surgeons request a head drape-two towels opened all the way and placed lengthwise under the patient's head. The top towel is then manipulated around the head like a turban covering the eyes and secured with a small towel clip or tape.

**Ventilation:** Controlled or spontaneous. Most CRNAs breath the child back ASAP and then switch to PSV Pro to assist their spontaneous ventilation. Most avoid waiting to the last second in attempting to breath the patient back. Then they titrate narcotics with the respiratory rate.

**Muscle Relaxant:** Rarely given, or 1-2mg/kg Succinylcholine and/or low dose NDMR.  
**Narcotics:** Minimal to avoid PONV, or  
1-2mcg/kg Fentanyl  
0.1mg/kg Morphine-more PONV documented  
  
**Duration: Tonsillectomy:** 15-45 minutes**Adenotonsillectomy:** 45-90 minutes

**Alternatives to narcotics**  
**Tylenol** (Ofirmev) IV 15mg/kg IV  
**Tylenol suppository:** Rectal Tylenol post induction. Dose of 40  
mg/kg is needed in children to achieve target serum concentrations  
(10-20 mcg/ml).  
**Toradol:** 1mg/kg IV dose. Many EENTs will forbid it due to the  
documentation of more bleeding. Less nausea reported.  
**Precedex (** **Dexmedetomidine):** Titrating in 0.5mcg/kg IV when the  
Sevoflurane is turned off and additional 0.5mcg/kg if the child is wakes up agitated.

**Ketamine:** 0.3-0.5mg/kg after induction, controversial.

**Tramadol** : 1.5mg/kg, rarely given.  
**Clonidine:** 4mcg/kg PO pre-op, rarely given.  

**IV Access:** After the new IV, feel free to give the patient a fluid bolus of 10-20cc/kg if not contraindicated.  
**Why we administer antibiotics**  
Decreased pain  
Decreased infection/inflammation  
Faster healing

**Positioning: Rose Position**  
**Rose Position:** Supine with head extended by placing a pillow or shoulder roll under the shoulders. A rubber ring or foam donut is placed under the head to stabilize it.  
**Rotate the bed 45% for the surgeon.**

Bed rotated 45 degrees for the surgeon after the airway is secure. Make sure your IV and other tubing have slack and out of the surgeon’s field.

After the surgeon is comfortable with the child’s position on the bed,  
a mouth clamp is applied to prye the child’s mouth wide open (usually a Boyle-Davis gag). The gag device can be very stimulating and we usually crank up the sevoflurane just prior or during this application. Do not chase the stress response with narcotics.

**Packing of the supraglottic area (throat pack)  
**The surgeon usually announces when the packing is applied. The most important part is making sure the packing is removed prior to emergence.  
Most of us document when the packing is replied and removed, however it is not mandatory.  
NEVER emerge and extubate your patient until you know the packing as been removed!  
  
**Antiemetics:** PONV is common following a tonsillectomy (30-65%) from blood in the stomach.  
**Zofran** 4mg IV has been the gold standard  
**Decadron** 0.2-0.5 mg/kg (max 20mg) IV  
**  
Why intraoperative steroids (decadron)?  
**Mood elevation-post op  
Appetite stimulation-post op  
Anti-inflammatory-less swelling  
Antiemetic  
Decadron study –shows it decreases post op pain  
Decadron half-life - 36-72 hours  
Decadron Low cost - $0.25/4mg

**During the procedure**  
While the surgeon is removing the tonsils, this is the time for you to quickly draw up your meds for the next case. Make sure your volume is up on your monitor so you won’t miss a beat while your back is turned away from the patient.  
The surgeon will usually give you a warning before the procedure is complete. This is when you let the patient breath spontaneously (if they are not already)

**Hand the surgeon an NG Tube  
**After the surgeon removes the throat pack and BEFORE the Boyle-Davis gag device is removed, we commonly hand an NG tube for the surgeon to insert and suction out the stomach. They usually use their own suction tubing.  
  
**Boyle –Davis gag device is removed (mouth retractor)**  
When the surgeon removes the Boyle –Davis gag device, you or someone else will rotate the bed back to the original position for you to have complete access to the airway. Never emerge the patient without easy access to the airway.

**Emergence  
**Just remember, a tiny drop of blood tickling the vocal cords while going through the excitatory state could induce a laryngospasm.

While the patient is still deep, gently suction the oropharynx to assure a dry airway. Make sure you do not damage or irritate the tonsillar bed in the process.

**Extubate your patient  
**Some deep, some awake? With OSA, always awake.  
Make sure you have a patent airway before leaving the OR.  
Most of us insert an oral airway if the extubation was deep.

**Transport the patient to RR** Many anesthesia providers still exubate the patient on their left side with the head of the bed slightly down.  
  
**Transporting Oxygen**

Many of us use the patient’s mask from the ventilator circuit and tape or stick O2 tubing up to it and place it close to the patients face. So they are getting flow by oxygen from the tank at around set at 10LPM.

While the patient is being transported laterally.  
  
**Emergency Equipment**  
Many of us bring a syringe of Succinylcholine just incase of a laryngosasm.  
  

**Possible Complications**

**Immediate Complications  
**Primary hemorrhage  
Post op hemorrhage: 0.1-8.1%  
Injury to tongue  
Trauma to anterior and posterior pillars  
Damaged uvula, soft palate, superior or constrictor muscle  
Injury to teeth and/or gums -from the gag device  
Aspiration of food  
Facial edema

Jaw joint discomfort or clicking from the gag device

Emesis-(30-65%) irritant blood in the stomach  
gagging-(inflammation/edema)  
Dehydration

**Airway fire risk:** Highest when electrocautery or laser methods are utilized.  
Other methods are very low fire risk and lowering the FIO2 down to 30% is not necessary.

**  
Delayed complications:**  
**Infections** - usually a week after the surgery.  
**Bleeding** during this period is known as secondary hemorrhage.  
Coblation method tonsillectomy: 11.1%-bleed  
Lung complications  
Scaring of soft palate and pillars  
Tonsillar remnants  
Hypertrophy of lingual tonsil  
Aspiration of food  
Facial edema  
  
Trauma to posterior pillar causes nasal regurgitation whenever the patient attempts to drink fluids after surgery. It may also cause undesirable changes in the voice- Rhinolalia aperta**.**  
Studies have shown that adenoid regrowth occurs in as many as 20% of the cases after removal

**Origin of bleeding**  
Tonsillar fossa - 67%  
nasopharynx - 26%  
both - 7%

**Consider the admission to ICU or a monitored bed for the patients below:**

< 24 months of age  
Morbidly obese patients who are > 97th percentile in weight.  
Kids with a neuromuscular disease (myasthenia, muscular dystrophy, spinal cord disorders, severe cerebral palsy.  
Chromosomal disorders prone to airway obstruction(Down syndrome, Pierre Robin syndrome and Treacher Collins).  
Craniofacial syndromes  
Complex or Cyanotic congenital heart disease  
Cor pulmonale  
RV hypertrophy  
Sickle Cell  
Previous trauma or burns to the airway or face.

**More Notes**  
**Post op bleeding Symptoms  
**Always check the back of the patient's throat with a flashlight for trickling of blood.  
Clots or fresh blood in the nose or throat  
Frequent swallowing  
Repetitive clearing of the throat  
Vomiting of dark blood  
Decreased BP  
Tachycardia  
Pallor, and restlessness are hallmark signs of hemorrhage and should be reported to the surgeon immediately.  
  
Some studies show that nausea, vomiting, and/or dehydration occur between 40% and 85% post operatively.  
PONV delays drinking fluids and increases the risk of dehydration.  
  
Kids with persistent vomiting or refusal to swallow, monitor urine output, and consider parenteral rehydration if dehydration is evident.  
  
In the PACU, ice chips and fluid are offered once the child is conscious and reflexes have returned. It is controversial whether fluids should be lukewarm or cold. Consider the child’s preferences.  
  
Avoid permitting a child in using straws or pacifiers; the sucking action can precipitate bleeding.  
  
There may be an increased throat discomfort between postoperative days 4 and 8 due to separation of eschar from the pharyngeal bed.  
  
Delayed hemorrhage can occur 7 to 10 days post procedure.
