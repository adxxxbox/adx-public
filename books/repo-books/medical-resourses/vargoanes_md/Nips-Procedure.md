**NIPs Procedure  
(Non-Invasive Programmed Stimulation (NIPS) for AICD Evaluation)**

  
This is just a basic procedure to test an existing AICD. Sometimes we do them in the EP Lab Holding Area. We just administer a little Propofol or Etomidate before the cardiologist test the AICD. You still need to have your intubation equipment and emergency meds on standby just in case of complications. Just remember these patients usually have a low EF.
