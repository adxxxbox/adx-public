### PCEA Settings and Set Up

PCEA (Patient Controlled Epidural Analgesia)

**PCEA Settings (there are also many different acceptable settings)  
**After administering 5cc x 2 or 1 10cc, your preferred bolus of a mixtures of mixture of LA and an additives of your choice, it is time to connect the patient to a PCEA (patient-controlled epidural analgesia).  
Some providers will add small dose of narcotics in their mixture-usually fentanyl. Some avoid narcotics after the initial bolus to avoid potential side effects.  
There are many possible settings and cocktail mixtures for the PCEA.  
  
**Epidural Tubing  
**Many pumps require special tubing (epidural tubing), so be sure to grab the specific tubing for your pump before you enter the patient’s room. Some hospitals will have extra epidural tubing stocked in their epidural placement carts.  
  
**Plastic Case  
The epidural pump may be enclosed in** a hard plastic case/lockbox and a key is required in order to load the epidural pump for use. If you do not have narcotic in your epidural mixture, it may not be enclosed in a lock box. We don’t want patients tampering with their meds.  
  
When programming the pump, first plug it in.  
  
Next, press the **ON/OFF** button.  
Many pumps perform a self-test and ask you to press ENTER.  
  
**Clear History of the Pump  
**You may want to CLEAR HISTORY.  
Press the appropriate buttons to clear the history from the previous patient.  
  
**The pump may still be locked**  
If it says KEYPAD LOCKED, you will need to unlock it based on manufacturer settings. If the keypad is locked and you do not know the code, you will not be able to program or adjust settings.  
Press OPTIONS and then press FULL LOCK.  
It may then prompt you to enter the lock sequence number; to unlock the pump so that you can reprogram it. So know your sequence number.  
**Do you want a Continuous Infusion, Bolus Only or Continuous + Bolus** ?  
We usually press (CONT + BOLUS).  
  
**Set Continuous Infusion Rate**  
The pump will ask you to set the rate. Press ENTER when done.  
Common rates are 8-15 mLs/hour (12 mLs/hour is popular).  
  
**Loading Dose  
**Next it asks you whether you want to program a LOADING DOSE.  
Say NO.  
Most providers will manually inject the loading in safe increments and assess the patient.  
A common loading doses is 12-15 10 mLs just in case you wanted to know.  
  
**Patient Controlled Demand (Bolus Dose)**This mode may have various names on various pumps.  
The most common name is “DEMAND.”  
It acts as a small top off dose and is given by the pump when the patient starts to hurt and presses the red button on their handheld remote.  
Set your bolus dose and press ENTER.  
4-5 mLs/hr may be helpful for a primigravida (first pregnancy) with a long labor ahead or if the epidural is for overnight labor.  
  
**Bolus Lockout  
**The pump will ask you for a BOLUS LOCKOUT.  
Enter 10 or 15 minutes, depending on your regimen, and press ENTER.  
This will limit the time interval the patient could receive a “Demand” bolus per hour.  
A LOCKOUT set at 15 minutes limits the patient to 4 DEMAND Boluses per hour no matter how many times they press the red button. **Hourly Limit  
**Next it may ask you for your hourly limit. select (NO LIMIT SELECTED) or enter the max MLs an hour you want the patient to receive.  
  
**Container (IV Bag) Size**  
Next it may ask you to enter CONTAINER SIZE.  
Enter 250 the total mLs in the container. It is better to underestimate your volume. For example, if your epidural mixture is 100 MLs, it will save you a headache if you program 80 mLs. This gives you notice to replace your bag before it is completely empty with substantial air in the line. if you haven’t removed any solution from the bag  
Enter 230 mL if you have withdrawn a 20 mL loading dose from the bag.  
  
**Air Sensitivity  
**It will eventually ask for AIR SENSITIVITY.  
Alerts you when there is air in the line.  
Most of us turn it off because we utilize a filter on our catheters.  
  
**Program Review Option** (review your settings you just entered)  
The pump should have a PROGRAM REVIEW OPTION.  
You must press the down arrow to review the program parameters you have selected. When the review is complete, press ENTER.  
The program will be saved and you must press START to begin the infusion.  
**Common PCEA Settings  
  
Most Common Mixed Solutions  
**0.0625-0.125% Bupivacaine with 2mcg/cc of Fentanyl  
(0.125% Bupivacaine with 2mcg/cc Fentanyl is more popular)  
or  
0.15-0.2% Ropivacaine with 2mcg/cc Fentanyl  
(0.2% Ropivacaine with 2mcg/cc Fentanyl is more popular)**Continuous infusion:** 8-15 ml/h (most use 12 ml/hr)**Bolus Loading Dose):** 10-12 ml (we normally just manually bolus)**Air sensitivity:** OFF  
  
**1 hour maximum:** continuous infusion + demand doses Ineffective analgesia is often due to inadequate hourly max leading to "lockout."
