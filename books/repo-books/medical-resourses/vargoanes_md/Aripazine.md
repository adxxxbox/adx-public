### Ciraparantag (aripazine)

**_A broad anticoagulant antidote awaiting FDA approval._**  
Aripazine is a water-soluble cationic small molecule being developed as a universal antidote to reverse the anticoagulant effect of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), fondaparinux, and low molecular weight heparins (LMWH’s). It works through non-covalent hydrogen bonding and may have a wide spectrum of action including unfractionated heparins.  
  
**Method of Action**  
It binds to oral factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs), as well as UFH and LMWH via non-covalent bonding and charge-charge interactions to neutralize anticoagulation and bleeding.
