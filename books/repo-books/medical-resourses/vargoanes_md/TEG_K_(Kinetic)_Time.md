**TEG K (Kinetic) Time**

**K (Kinetic) Time 1-3 minutes  
**K is the time elapsed until the clot reaches a fixed strength (20mm).  
K is impacted by Fibrinogen.  

Together with the alpha angle, it is a measure of clot strengthening.  
Elevation of K time represents a deficiency of Fibrinogen and is treated with FFP/Cryoprecipitate.
