### Pericardial Window

Pericardial window is a procedure to alleviate a **cardiac tamponade.  
**Cardiac tamponade is the accumulation of blood, a blood clot, or fluid in the intrapericardial space that is sufficient to raise the pressure surrounding the heart to the point where cardiac filling is altered.  
  
Chronic cardiac tamponade develops over time, The patient may be stable and not decompensated, thus making this an easy case to manage.  
  
A small incision is performed below the sternum or via a small incision between the ribs on the left side of the chest. An opening is made in the pericardium with the goal of draining the pericardial effusion and thus eliminating the cardiac tamponade.  
  
Technically this case is a pericardiocentesis with a long needle and small sub- xiphoid incision. A drainage device is usually inserted at the end of the procedure.  
  
**Results of a cardiac tamponade  
**Decreased cardiac filling.  
Markedly elevated venous pressures.  
Large decreased cardiac output.  
Shock.  
Death, if not treated.  
  
**Right heart is affected first**  
Because of its lower pressures, the right heart is most vulnerable and abnormal right heart filling is the earliest sign of a hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion.  
_Eventually the pressures in the all the cardiac chambers equilibrate._  
  
**Initial compensation**  
In order to fill the right heart, there is a compensatory increase in systemic venous pressure, which results from venoconstriction and fluid retention.  
**Note:** An acute cardiac tamponade from hemorrhage may result in a rapid circulatory collapse. Not only does intrapericardial pressure rapidly rise but intravascular volume falls, preventing a compensatory increase in venous pressure.  
  
**Possible manifestations and clinical findings depend on the timeline**  
Kussmaul sign: JVD during inspiration.  
Pulses paradoxus in 75% with acute cardiac tamponade, 30% with chronic pericardial effusion.  
Beck’s Triad (low arterial blood pressure, distended neck veins, and distant, muffled heart sounds): in 33% of acute cardiac tamponade.**  
  
Echocardiogram:  
**Presence of pericardial fluid with atrial or ventricular collapse.  
Abnormal ventricular septal motion with inspiration.  
  
**Hemodynamics**  
Increased RAP/PAWP  
Tachycardia and decreased cardiac output  
  
**Respiratory:** Dyspnea, orthopnea  
  
**Possible EKG changes**  
Low voltage QRS complex and ST changes.  
PR segment depression.  
Electrical alternans (alternate-beat variations).

**Treatment prior to surgical correction: maintain stroke volume  
**Expand intravascular volume.  
Administer inotropes.  
Correct metabolic acidosis resulting from low cardiac output.  
Administer isuprel or dobutamine infusion to increase heart rate and contractility.  
Administer atropine for bradycardia resulting from vagal reflexes invoked by increased intrapericardial pressure.  
Dopamine infusion to increase SVR may also be employed.  
  
**Anesthesia Management for a Cardiac Tamponade  
(Fast: tachycardia; full: (hypervolemia); and tight: (increased SVR))  
_Warning:_** _General anesthesia and positive pressure ventilation (PPV) in a patient with hemodynamic compromise resulting from cardiac tamponade can be devastating._  
  
In the case of a repeated cardiac surgical procedure, the surgeon will reopen the chest and not extubate. Administer 100% Oxygen after decompression.  
  
**Goals:  
****Heart rate:** Maintain 90-140 BPM  
**Volume:** 250-500 ml crystalloid  
  
Optimize filling pressures to compensate for the vasodilation seen with induction of anesthesia.

**If a pulmonary catheter is present:** Maintain filling pressures high enough to overcome diastolic filling pressures. CVP or PCWP may need to be > 20-30 mmHg.  
**Spontaneous ventilation:** Maintain as long as possible if muscle relaxation is not required.  
  
**If PPV is required:** Minimize PIP and avoid PEEP.  
PPV increases intrathoracic pressure and decreases venous return.  
Let the patient resume spontaneous ventilation if not muscle relaxed.  
  
**Pre-op preparation:  
**Select agents that minimize cardiac depression and cause the least vasodilation and hypotension.  
Inotropes / chronotropes should be available.  
Epinephrine and other vasopressors.  
Epinephrine or dobutamine infusion may be needed.  
Ketamine.  
Fentanyl.  
Versed.  
NaHCO3 if metabolic acidosis is present.  
  
**Monitors**  
Pulmonary artery (Swan Ganz) catheter is less common today.  
Arterial line.  
Continuous TEE to assess ventricular filling and contractility, if available.  
Large bore IV.  
  
Maintain adequate cardiac output and blood pressure.  
Some surgeons will not require muscle relaxation and will permit spontaneous ventilation  
  
**Anesthetics:** General/ETT  
**Induction:**  
Ketamine 0.25-1mg/kg  
**RSI:** Succinylcholine 1-2 mg/kg for intubation.  
Low dose Propofol may be used for non-critical patients.  
  
**Muscle relaxants:** low dose norcuron or rocuronium (Zemuron®) if muscle relaxation is required.**Duration:** 15-60 minutes  
**IV Access:** 1-2 18G IVs  
**Arterial Line**  
  
**Support circulation:  
**Neosynephrine 100-200 mcg as needed.  
Vasopressin 1-2 units as needed.  
Epinephrine 5-10 mcg as needed.  
Norepinephrine 8-16 units as needed.  
  
**Provide additional IV anesthesia as tolerated:**  
Ketamine 10-20 mg.  
Fentanyl 25-50 mcg.  
  
**Volume:** Maintain filling pressures high enough to overcome diastolic filling pressures.  
CVP or PCWP may need to be > 20-30 mmHg.  
  
_Anticipate a rebound hypertensive response or return of normal hemodynamics after the tamponade is relieved._  
  
**More Notes:**  
**Cardiac tamponade**  
This is a medical emergency. Occurs in approximately 2 out of 10,000 people.  
  
Mortality rate depends on the speed of diagnosis, treatment, and the underlying cause of the tamponade.  
  
Goals are a decreased preload, SV, CO and Arterial Pressure, and an increased HR.  
  
First symptom is decreased BP with reflex tachycardia.  
  
Pulsus paradoxus will be present; normally SBP decreases 6 mmHg or less with inspiration. Tamponade will induce a marked increase (>10 mmHg).  
  
Right and left atrial pressures and RVEDP equalize at 20 mmHg.  
  
Treatment is pericardiocentesis.  
  
**Mechanisms of Acute Tamponade**  
A rapid increase in intra-pericardial fluid produces an acute tamponade, with pressures reaching 20-30 mmHg. Beck’s Triad results: (systemic venous pressure rises, heart volumes are reduced, and systemic arterial pressure falls).  
  
This compression also causes pulsus paradoxus, which is a decrease in arterial pressure of more than 10 mmHg during inspiration. Cardiac filling is severely restricted during diastole.
