Colonoscopy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Colonoscopy

Colonoscopy is an endoscopic medical procedure and is one of many methods to screen for colon cancer. The colonoscope is a thin, flexible tube that ranges from 4-6 feet long.

A well-lubricated colonoscope is inserted into the anus and then is advanced slowly, into the rectum, through the colon and usually as far up as the cecum.

At this point the colonoscope is slowly withdrawn. There is very little stimulation when the flexible tube is slowly exiting and you could reduce your Propofol infusion. 

Air is usually pumped through the colonoscope to help clear the path or open the colon.

The physician views the procedure in real time video on the monitor. Instruments to remove polyps or take samples of tissues, biopsies and foreign body removal can be achieved through the scope.

**Bowel Prep**  
Remember these patients are probably dehydrated from their prep.  
Most GI labs DO NOT hydrate these patients well once the IV is inserted.  
As soon as you get your patient into the room, you should place the NC with ETCO2 sampling on the patient to build up their FRC while you are connecting the other monitors.

Some GI labs are very efficient, allowing little time between the patient entering the room and the start of the procedure.  
**Cardiac:** Watch for a vagal effect when air is insufflated into the patient’s colon.  
Arrhythmias from dehydration and a decreased SVR from Propofol are not rare.  
**Equipment:** Appropriate size oral airway, suction and Ambu bag within arm’s reach.

**Anesthetic:** General TIVA or Total IV Anesthesia with a Propofol infusion.  
In addition to Propofol, some CRNAs administer 2mg of Versed or combine the Versed with Ketamine. There are many different cocktails.

  
**Position:** Left lateral with their knees drawn up towards the abdomen. Pillow tucked beneath their head for cervical neutrality.  
It is good to start infusing the Propofol before the GI doc starts inserting a lubricated gloved finger into the anus to check for any abnormal masses or blockages. This is usually not desirable for an awake patient.   
**Bedside Meds:** Robinul, Atropine, Ephedrine and Anectine.

**Duration:** 15-60 minutes

**IV Access:** 22G is acceptable

  
**Possible Complications:**  
Colonic perforation  
Post-polypectomy bleeding  
Postpolypectomy Electrocoagulation Syndrome  
Infection  
Gas Explosion  
cardiac arrhythmias  
MI

**More Notes:**  
The doctor may have someone press on the abdomen or reposition the patient in order to advance the scope through the colon. This is more stimulating to the patient.

**Related Notes:  
Colonoscopic Tattooing**  
When a lesion requires “marking” to aid localization for a later surgical removal or endoscopic follow-up, a permanent dye is injected to tattoo the colon adjacent to the lesion.

There is clear evidence that removing adenomas (polyps) during a colonoscopy reduces risk for colorectal cancer significantly.

A screening colonoscopy is recommended for anyone 50 years of age and older, and for anyone with parents, siblings or children with a history of colorectal cancer or polyps.
