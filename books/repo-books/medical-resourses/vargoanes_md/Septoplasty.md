### Septoplasty-Nasal

This is a submucosal resection of the septum: SMR, or Septal reconstruction. It is a corrective surgical procedure done to straighten a deviated nasal septum. The deviated septum can be congenital or from trauma.    
A septoplasty may also be done to allow access into the nose to remove nasal polyps. Bony and/or cartilaginous portions of the septum are removed.

**Indications:** To correct nasal airway obstruction and to alleviate chronic sinus symptoms. Like other intranasal surgeries, the surgeon injects a local anesthetic with Epi, so watch the patient’s  HR and BP.  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT; usually with an oral Rae and consider an LTA kit.  
**Muscle relaxant:** Theoretically, the patient does not need to be relaxed, but we usually do to avoid coughing.  
**Inhalation Agent:** Sevo or Forane are popular for these procedures.

**Duration:** 45-90 minutes  
**EBL:** 10-100 mLs.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
**Positioning:** Supine with the HOB up 10-20 degrees or reverse T-berg. Tuck the patient’s arm on the side where the surgeon will sit or stand. Sometimes the bed is rotated 90 degrees. 

**Antiemetics:** yes to Decadron and Zofran.  
**Emergence:** Smooth, avoid coughing. Give Lidocaine .25 mg/kg to stop the coughing. Consider Robinul to prevent secretions from draining onto and agitating the vocal cords.

Gently suction the oral pharynx with a catheter but not a Yankauer. At the end of the operation it is standard to have a packed sponge dressing in each nostril to soak up any blood. This is kept in for a few hours. The patient is now an obligate mouth breather.  
**Extubation:** Deep or Awake? Many CRNAs will extubate deep. Some patients may require an awake extubation, so try to make it smooth. Some CRNAs insert an LMA immediately after a deep extubation and transport the patient to the recovery room. The LMA is removed when the patient awakes. This drastically decreases turnover time.

**Possible Complications:** 

Septal perforation.  
Bleeding  
Infection  
Damage to the eye and its associated structures.  
Permanent numbness of the upper teeth, palate or face.
