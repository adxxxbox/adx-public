# Amidate (Etomidate)

**Amidate (Etomidate)**  
**Class:** GABA mimetic  
**Induction Dose:** 0.3-0.6mg/kg  
**ECTs:** 0.2-0.3 mg/kg  
**Onset:** 30-40 seconds  
**Peak:** 1 minute  
**Duration:**3-10 minutes  
Induction Agent of choice for any patient who would not tolerate the hypotensive effects of Propofol, especially the cardiac patients.  
Ex. Patients with CAD, unstable CV status, dry (vascular) and cerebral vascular disease.  
Has the least myocardial effects of all IV induction agents.  
Very painful on injection, pretreat with lidocaine.  
It can cause myoclonus, PONV and adrenal suppression.  
  
**Elimination:** Hepatic and Plasma cholinesterase.  
3% in unchanged in the urine.  
10-13% of this metabolite is found in the bile.  
**Half-time:** 2-5 hours  
**Metabolized:** By liver and plasma esterases.  
Decreases ICP, CMR and CBF? Yes  
Adrenalcortical Suppression: Yes, with repeated doses.  
**Nausea: Yes**  
**MOA:** Binds to GABA receptor and enhances the receptor's affinity for the GABA neurotransmitter.  
**Involuntary myoclonic movements:** Sometimes  
**An imidazole-containing compound**  
It's like Versed, water soluble at an acidic pH and lipid soluble at physiologic pH.  
**Pharmokinetics of Etomidate (Amidate)**  
Large volume distribution - very lipid soluble.  
Penetrates the brain rapidly reaching peak levels within 1 minute.  
Weak base (pH 4.2, pH 8.2, 99% unionized at physiologic pH) contributing to a PAINFUL injection.  
76% is bound to albumin. So increases effect with low albumin levels.  
Involuntary myoclonic movements are common due to the alteration in the balance of inhibitory and excitatory influences on the thalamocortical tract. These can be attenuated by giving an opioid prior to induction.  
Very little hangover effect.  
An opioid prior to induction will help blunt the hemodynamic responses from direct laryngoscopy.  
  
**Limiting Factor of Etomidate (Amidate)**  
It transiently depresses adrenocortical function.  
Can contribute to PONV.  
Prolonged infusion can inhibit adrenocortical synthesis and potential mortality in ICU patients.  
  
**CNS and Etomidate (Amidate)**  
Potent direct cerebral vasoconstrictor that decreases CBF and CRM02 35-45% -lowers ICP.  
Suppression of adrenocortical function limits its clinical usefulness for long-term treatment of increased ICP.  
Should be used with caution in patients with focal epilepsy. Conversely, Etomidate also possesses anticonvulsant properties, and has been used to terminate status epilepticus.  
  
**Cardiovascular System and Etomidate (Amidate)**  
Induction dose of 0.3mg/kg IV is associated with cardiovascular stability with minimal changes in HR, SV, MAP may decrease up to 15% because of a drop in SVR.  
Minimal drop in BP, up to just 15%.  
  
**Ventilation and Etomidate (Amidate)**  
Depression of ventilation is less than barbiturates.  
Apnea may occur with rapid IV injection.  
Majority of time it decreases tidal volume and increase RR over 3-5 minutes.  
  
**Myoclonus Dystonia and Etomidate (Amidate)**  
Myoclonus-dystonia (M-D) is a movement disorder characterized by a combination of rapid, brief muscle contractions (myoclonus), and/or sustained twisting and repetitive movements that result in abnormal postures (dystonia).  
This occurs in 50-80% of the patients who receive Etomidate without premedication. Fentanyl and Versed will decrease the incidence.  
Appears to be from the disinhibiting of subcortical structures that normally suppress extrapyramidal motor activity.  
  
**Adrenolcortical Suppression and Etomidate (Amidate)**  
Etomidate inhibits the enzyme 11-beta-hydroxylase for 4-8 hours after induction. 11 Beta-hydroxylase converts cholesterol to cortisol. Patients need an intact cortisol response for the body to properly respond to stress.  
  
**Allergic Reactions of Etomidate (Amidate)**  
Incidences of allergic reactions are low.
