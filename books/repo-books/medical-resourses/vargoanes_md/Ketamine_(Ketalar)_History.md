### Ketamine (Ketalar) History

Ketamine is a derivative of Phencyclidine (PCP).  
**The common street names of PCP:** Angel dust  
**Two common street names for ketamine:** Special K or KMore street names are listed at the bottom of this page.  
\-The history of ketamine began in the 1950s at Parke-Davis and Company's laboratories in Detroit, Michigan, when they searched for an ‘ideal’ anesthetic agent with analgesic properties.  
\- A medicinal chemist, V. Harold Maddox, Ph.D., discovered a process that eventually led to the synthesis of phencyclidine or PCP \[ _N_ \-(1-phenyl-cyclohexyl)-piperidine\] on 26 March 1956.  
\- In 1958, Dr. Graham Chen, M.D., Ph.D., and his associates received the compound from Maddox in September 1958.  
Not long after, Chen and Dr. Domino both began to study the experimental effects of PCP on animals.  
\- PCP created potent analgesia in animals: Laparotomies were performed in monkeys without pain, but the animals were in a cataleptic state with their eyes open, and muscle relaxation was of poor quality.  
\- Chen defined catalepsy as a ‘characteristic akinetic state with a loss of orthostatic reflexes but without impairment of consciousness while the extremities appear to be paralyzed by motor and sensory failure.’  
\- In 1958, the first human trials of PCP were published by Dr. Greifenstein, a professor of anesthesiology at the Wayne State University, Detroit.  
\- When experimenting with PCP, he found it was an excellent anesthetic but unsuitable in the anesthesia field because the patients became too agitated, delusional, and irrational in their clinical studies.  
The incidence of prolonged emergence delirium was not acceptable.  
\- In 1959, Johnstone and Evans published their clinical experience in the _British Journal of Anaesthesia_ .  
\- They stated that PCP (also called Sernyl) was undoubtedly the most potent general analgesic agent used in clinical medicine.  
\- It had the unique advantage over other sedatives and analgesics that it did not cause depression of cardiovascular and respiratory function, nor depression of pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes.  
\- It could be used safely in elderly patients.  
\- However, they also mentioned its limited use due to psychotic reactions.  
\- Later, Dr. Calvin Lee Stevens, Ph.D., synthesized a sequence of phencyclidine derivatives for  
preclinical pharmacological testing for Parke Davis.  
\- Dr. Stevens was a professor of Organic Chemistry at Wayne State University and a chemical consultant to Parke Davis Laboratories.  
\- Drs Graham Chen MD, Duncan A. McCarthy Ph.D., and others screened these PCP derivatives in animals, especially monkeys.  
\- One of the derivatives, in particular, was found to be a successful, short-acting anesthetic with fewer side effects than PCP.  
\- Around 1963, that one derivative was selected for human testing and titled CI-581 \[2-( _O_ \-chloro-phenyl)-2-methyl-amino cyclohexanone\] and is what we now call ketamine.  
\- Ketamine was named because of the **ket** one and the **amine** group in its chemical structure.  
\- Ketamine was still minimally utilized but often used for veterinary purposes in Belgium.  
\- In 1964, it was proven that compared to PCP, it produced minor hallucinogenic effects and shorter psychotomimetic effects.  
\- Soon, ketamine had established a safe profile in animals.  
This led Alex Lane, M.D., Head of Clinical Pharmacology at Parke Davis, to find someone to test it in humans.  
\- Early 1964, Edward Domino was contacted by Alex Lane, M.D, to study CI-581 in humans.  
\- Since Edward Domino was not an anesthesiologist and felt uncomfortable, he called his colleague Dr. Guenter Corssen, a professor in anesthesiology at the University of Michigan, who was also interested in intravenous anesthetics.  
\- Dr. Corssen, a war hero in the Wehrmacht during World War II, emigrated to the United States after the war and practiced anesthesiology and pain medicine.  
\- In August 1964, the first human administration of ketamine was conducted by Corssen and Domino to volunteer prisoners at the Jackson Prison in Michigan.  
\- Using lower doses of ketamine, the incidence of adverse effects among participants was about 33%.  
\- Corssen and Domino observed that patients described their feeling of floating in outer space and having no feeling in their limbs. The term named from this feeling by Domino is “dissociative anesthesia.”  
\- In 1966, Domino and Dr. Corssen published evidence that ketamine could be safe and effective for clinical anesthetic use.  
\- They concluded that ketamine could rapidly produce profound analgesia with a unique state of altered consciousness and limited duration of effect that could be safely prolonged with repeated administration.  
\- They also reported minimal side effects and a lack of severe emergence delirium compared to phencyclidine.  
\- In 1966, ketamine was patented in the US by Parke-Davis for human and animal use.  
\- Ketamine became available by prescription in 1969 in the form of ketamine hydrochloride, under the name of Ketalar.  
\- In 1969, the introduction of ketamine (at high doses) as a sole anesthetic to patients in Britain was unsuccessful,  
\- It had been described as a ‘disaster’ from which the drug never recovered.  
\- In 1970, hallucinations were considered so unpleasant that patient acceptance was much lower than with the barbiturates.  
\- In 1970, in the form of ketamine hydrochloride, the name Ketalar was officially approved for human consumption by the United States Food and Drug Administration.  
\- Because of its sympathomimetic properties and its wide margin of safety, ketamine was being administered as a field anesthetic to soldiers during the Vietnam war.  
\- It was and still is the drug of choice for people in traumatic shock who are at risk of hypotension.  
\- Domino _et al._ continued to research and publish on ketamine, and the literature soon had contributions from German, Italian, Brazilian, Japanese, and Danish research teams.  
\- Ketamine arrived in France in 1970 after the 1968 publication by Lassner in ‘Les Cahiers d’Anesthésiologie’.  
  
**The abuse of ketamine:**  
\- Ketamine was becoming abused during the Vietnam war and on the East Coast of the United States (the Vietnam war ended in 1975).  
\- The street abuse increased from 1978 onwards following the publication of two books about authors’ psychedelic experiences from ketamine.  
  
**\- The two books were:  
**“Journeys into the Bright World” by Marcia Moore  
“The Scientist” by John Lily  
  
**Ketamine also became known as a date-rape drug:**  
Ketamine may be used in drug-facilitated sexual assaults because of its sedative and dissociative properties.  
  
**Ketamine became less popular:**  
\- Due to the street abuse of ketamine and the introduction of Propofol in the 1970s, the clinical use of ketamine was drastically reduced.  
\- In 1999, ketamine was declared a Class III substance of the US Controlled Substances Act.  
  
**Through time and more research, ketamine has regained popularity and is now used for many purposes:  
**The battlefield with injured soldiers and has been widely used for emergency surgery in field conditions in war zones.  
\- Multimodal analgesia for surgical procedures requiring anesthesia.  
**\- Multimodal analgesia:** Consists of administering two or more drugs that act by different mechanisms for providing analgesia.  
**  
Other uses:**\- Critical care medicine and emergency department  
\- OCD  
\- Suicidal ideation\- Acute agitation  
\- Acute pain  
\- Burn patients  
\- Postoperative pain  
\- Certain chronic pain syndromes-fibromyalgia  
\- Non-cancer pain  
\- Depression  
\- Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)  
  
**The opioid crisis also enhanced ketamine usage during anesthesia** .  
\- In anesthesia, ketamine is commonly used with multimodal analgesia to decrease opioid requirements in specific surgical procedures.  
\- It is mainly used at lower doses.  
\- Low doses of ketamine and the concomitant administration of a benzodiazepine (midazolam) have drastically reduced the occurrences of emergence delirium.  
  
The opening of Ketamine Clinics is now occurring nationwide.
