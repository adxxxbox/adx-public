### Total & High Spinal Notes Part 1

Can occur with either epidural or spinal anesthesia  
Like any other medical procedures, there are risks associated with regional anesthesia.

The sympathectomy produced by spinal anesthesia induces hemodynamic changes. The block height determines the extent of sympathetic blockade, which determines the amount of change in cardiovascular parameters. The higher, the worse.  
  
Higher neuraxial blockade resulting in hypoxia or hypercarbia can cause profound peripheral vasodilatation leading to significant decrease in venous return and poor atrial filling.  
  
**Why Bradycardia?  
**The sympathetic blockade, decreased venous return and unopposed parasympathetic activity may produce significant bradycardia and hypotension resulting in cardiac arrest.  
  
A higher neuraxial blockade may be due to:  
Excessive doses of local anesthetic  
Failure to reduce the susceptibility to excessive spread (i.e. elderly, pregnant, obese, or short patients)  
Increased sensitivity  
Excessive spread  
  
When dosing a spinal or epidural, it is important to monitor the patient’s vital signs and block level.  
  
Use of alcohol wipes as well as pin prick testing every few minutes will help track the block’s progression.  
  
**Incremental dosing**  
Incremental dosing of your local anesthetic allows the anesthesia provider to determine if the epidural block is progressing more rapidly than anticipated.  
  
**Hyperbaric Spinal**  
With hyperbaric spinal techniques, changing the patient’s position may slow down excessive spread.  
  
**Initial symptoms include the following:**  
Dyspnea  
Numbness or weakness of the upper extremities (tingling in the fingers)  
Nausea will usually precede hypotension (hypoperfusion of the brain is responsible for nausea)  
Mild to moderate hypotension  
  
**At this point:**  
Change the patient’s position if a hyperbaric spinal was used  
Stop the administration of epidural local anesthetics  
Apply supplemental oxygen  
Open up the IV fluids wide open  
Treat hypotension with ephedrine or phenylephrine  
Treat tachycardia/bradycardia.  
  
**Use common sense:** you do not treat hypotension with neosynephrine when the patient presently has a low HR. Phenylephrine is the medication of choice if the patient is tachycardic and hypotensive.  
  
**Epinephrine Doses**  
Refractory bradycardia and/or hypotension should be rapidly treated with epinephrine (starting with small 5-10 mcg doses). Epinephrine should be repeated and doses increased until the desired effect is obtained.  
  
**If the block has spread up to cervical dermatomes the following will be noted:**  
Severe hypotension Bradycardia  
Respiratory insufficiency  
  
**A,B,Cs**  
Additional spread may lead to unconsciousness and apnea.  
Treatment includes the A, B, C’s:  
**Airway and breathing** \- supplemental oxygen, maintenance of a patent airway by intubation, and mechanical ventilation if necessary.  
**Circulation** \- aggressive intravenous fluid administration.  
  
**Trendelenburg position** and  
  
**Vasopressors** . If ephedrine and phenylephrine are not adequate to treat hypotension, then treat the patient with epinephrine.  
  
**Early and aggressive treatment**  
Early and aggressive treatment may avoid cardiac arrest!  
Bradycardia should be treated with atropine.  
Dopamine infusions may be considered.  
  
Once the patient has been successfully treated and stabilized, surgery can often proceed. The decision to proceed is based on individual circumstances such as severity and time spent hypotensive, indications of myocardial ischemia, etc.  
  
**Respiratory compromise associated with a high spinal is often transient.**
