Craniotomy Anesthesia    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Craniotomy Anesthesia

It is considered acceptable to use 0.5 MAC of an inhalation agent for craniotomy.  
A full MAC of an inhalation agent increases CBF and ICP and may also inhibit cerebral autoregulation for blood flow.  
In procedures where ICP is not an issue, a full MAC of inhalation agent is not harmful.  
  
**Most common anesthetic approach  
**Isoflurane is considered the volatile agent of choice; however, sevoflurane is also acceptable when dose is limited to half of MAC.Separate propofol and remifentanil (or sufentanil (Sufenta®) infusions are commonly administered to achieve the analgesia not provided by 0.5 MAC of inhalation agent..  
Phenylephrine (Neosynephrine®) is the pressor of choice for patients with normal cardiac function.  
  
**Antihypertensive medications may INCREASE ICP  
**Nitroprusside, nitroglycerine and nicardipine **ALL** dilate cerebral vessels and may increase intracranial pressure (ICP).  
In modern evidence-based practice, antihypertensive agents are kept available, and their administration titrated to effect when necessary.  
  
**Nicardipine** appears to be becoming more widely used as an antihypertensive for craniotomy procedures.  
  
**Antihypertensive drugs that do NOT increase ICP (short acting)  
**Thiopental was useful but is no longer available  
Propofol bolus  
Esmolol  
  
Hydralizine and labetalol are very rarely administered in craniotomies due to their duration of action.  
  
_Some providers prefer to use a full MAC of inhalation agent without opioid infusion with satisfactory results, not with-standing the recommendation to use one-half MAC.  
_  
**Pre-op:**  
Assess baseline neurological status. Patients who present with endotracheal tubes will remain intubated. ICP should be measured, and pertinent comorbidity noted and planned for.  
  
Define the type and location of the tumor. The location will dictate patient positioning and will predict the nature and extent of neurologic deficit. Communication between surgical and anesthesia teams is especially important during these procedures.  
  
Determine the nature and severity of any acute or chronic changes. Patients with acute changes are more likely to be sensitive to anesthetic effects on ICP.  
  
Less aggressive, slower-growing tumors are usually asymptomatic for longer periods.  
**MRI:** Useful in assessing for cerebral edema, midline shifts greater than 5 mm, and size of ventricles.  
  
**Labs**  
**Check electrolytes:** Electrolyte abnormalities are more likely in this setting secondary to use of loop diuretics.  
**Medications to consider:**  
**Steroids:** Patients with brain tumors are usually given steroids. Chronic steroid therapy suppresses the pituitary-adrenal axis, and this increases susceptibility to refractory hypotension.  
  
**Anticonvulsants:** If used, blood levels should be checked along with basic laboratory results.  
  
**Premedication:** benzodiazepines and opioids cause hypoventilation and hypercapnia, which contribute to ICP elevation; they should be avoided if this is a concern. Their effect on sensorium may render neurologic exam difficult to interpret.  
  
**  
Possible Infusions:**  
Nicardipine: 5-15 mg/hour (titrated to effect)Nitroprusside: 05.-5 mcg/kg/minute  
Nitroglycerine: 0.2-1.5 mcg/kg/minute (titrated to effect)  
Neosynephrine: titrated to effect  
Propofol: 50-100 mcg/kg/min.  
Remifentanil: 0.02-0.2 mcg/kg/min or  
Sufentanil (Sufenta®): 0.25-0.5 mg/kg/hr  
Transient hypotension should be treated with incremental doses of ephedrine or phenylephrine rather than IV fluids.  
**Foley catheter:** Necessary  
**Hydration:** Overhydration contributes to cerebral edema, and thus must be avoided. An initial infusion of albumin, 500 ml following a liter of crystalloid, is often used.  
**  
Significant events during craniotomy  
**Highly stimulating intraoperative events such as laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation, application of the Mayfield skull clamp and tightening of its pins, opening of the skull, and opening of the dura mater require deeper levels of anesthesia.  
Blood loss can be significant while the scalp flap is raised and may be hidden on the drapes or in a collection bag.  
Brain relaxation, using mannitol and/or furosemide, may be required prior to dural opening.  
  
The parietal dura is rich in pain fibers; manipulation of the dura is intensely painful  
**Intracranial procedure:** Depending on the indication and location of the pathology, the procedure may be brief and superficial (e.g., evacuation of subdural hematoma) or lengthy with microscopic dissection (e.g., clipping of a cerebral aneurysm).  
**Decreased anesthesia requirement:** Brain tissue has no pain receptors and thus less anesthesia is required.  
**Wound closure:** After the procedure is complete, the surgeon will close the dura and replace the bone, followed by scalp closure. Dural closure is painful.  
Closure can take an hour or more.  
  
Adequate anesthetic levels are required during application of dressings because movement of the endotracheal tube may cause bucking. It is prudent to delay reversal of any muscle relaxation or lightening of anesthetic level until dressing application is complete.  
  
**Monitoring for venous air embolism (VAE) in the sitting position**  
_See "Venous Air Embolism" for details._  
VAE can occur whenever the operative site is positioned above the level of heart, especially during a craniotomy in the sitting position.  
VAE can occur during a variety of intracranial procedures, including tumor resection or skull opening along venous sinuses, and has occurred at skull pin sites.  
  
**BP:** Preoperative discussion among surgical and anesthesia team should include target ranges for blood pressure.  
  
**Anesthetic:** General endotracheal.  
**Induction:** The goal is to induce gently to avoid increasing ICP or compromising CBF. For an aneurysm, the ICP is less important than hypertension during induction. The mortality rate associated with aneurysmal rupture during induction is substantial. Large drops in BP can also compromise the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).**Thiopental** is useful, but no longer available in the US.  
**Propofol or etomidate** are both acceptable.  
**Esmolol:** 100-150mg 2 minutes before laryngoscopy to prevent tachycardia.  
**Nicardipine,** **nitroglycerine or nitroprusside** should be connected and ready to titrate to effect.  
Laryngotracheal anesthesia (LTA) kit is recommended, but not universally used.  
  
**Hyperventilation** lowers ICP after intubation.  
Keep ETCO 2 around 30-35 mmHg and check a blood gas after induction before incision.  
Some neurosurgeons will request an ETCO 2 in the high 20s.  
**Fentanyl:** 5-10 mcg/kg may be given prior to laryngoscopy.  
**Remifentanil** may also be used.  
**Remifentanil induction dose** of 1-3 mcg/kg may be given over 1 minute.  
**Remifentanil induction infusion** of 0.5-1 mcg/kg/min may be for 5-8 minutes, after which endotracheal induction may be done.  
  
**Muscle Relaxants:** Selection and use of muscle relaxants are guided by the modes of neurologic monitoring employed. This should be determined and discussed among members of the team.  
  
Evoked potential monitoring, sensory evoked potentials (SEP) or motor evoked potentials (MEP), are used to assess the integrity of neural pathways.  
Their purpose is the avoidance of iatrogenic damage to parts of the pathways.  
Each imposes varying anesthetic techniques to preserve the integrity and reliability of monitoring.  
If such techniques are used, they should be discussed among the anesthesia team and among all providers carrying out the monitoring.  
  
If MEP are not being monitored, rocuronium or vecuronium may be used.  
Complete paralysis is necessary for intubation, and immobility for the procedure must be ensured.  
Succinylcholine increases ICP, and thus is to be avoided.  
However, considerations such as anticipated difficult airway may necessitate its use. Hypercarbia and hypoxia during failed attempts to manage the airway are more deleterious to ICP than is the use of succinylcholine.  
If used, it must be followed by use of a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant as soon as neuromuscular function has recovered.  
The duration of action of NDMR is reduced by many anticonvulsants.  
Atracurium and cisatracurium are not affected by anticonvulsants because of Hoffman elimination.  
Rocuronium and vecuronium are commonly used.  
  
If SEP are monitored, then both the type and dose of anesthetic agents affect the efficacy of monitoring.  
Evoked potentials (EP) of cortical regions are more susceptible to distortion by anesthetic agents than are deeper regions' EP such as brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) or somatosensory evoked response (SSER).  
It is crucial to the accuracy of monitoring that the type and quantities of various anesthetic drugs be coordinated with personnel tasked with the monitoring. Communication is especially important in this regard.  
  
The duration of action of NDMR is reduced by many anticonvulsants.  
**Inhalation Agent:** Isoflurane or sevoflurane at ½ MAC.  
**Propofol infusion:** Commonly infused when ½ inhalation MAC is advised.  
**Opioid infusion:** Sufentanil (Sufenta®) or remifentanil are usually concomitantly infused with propofol.  
  
**IV Access:** 1-2 large bore IVs (14-18g).  
**IV Fluid:** Most providers infuse lactated ringers despite the recommendation of most texts to use normal saline. A liter of lactated ringers provides approximately 100 ml of free water. Dextrose-containing solutions are contraindicated because they increase neuronal lactate production and exacerbate edema and ischemia. This may result in persistently poor neurologic outcome.  
  
**Foley catheter:** Necessary; excessive urine output may result from the use of mannitol and furosemide (Lasix®). Fluid balance is guided by urine output among other parameters. Use of mannitol, which may result in five-liter urine output, especially when followed by furosemide. Volume restriction, formerly recommended to improve ICP, is no longer recommended.  
Norvolemia is to be sought, but overhydration avoided.  
  
**Temperature:** Normothermic. Hyperthermia may increase susceptibility to brain injury. Mild hypothermia, with decrease of body temperature by 2-3°C, provides significant neuroprotection. Deeper hypothermia is used with bypass, especially for deep hypothermic cardiac arrest, sometimes necessary in the surgical correction of aneurysm.  
  
**Nitrous Oxide:** N 2 O, when combined with a volatile anesthetic, can further increase CBF. When given alone, nitrous oxide causes mild cerebral vasodilation and can potentially increase ICP.**Central Line and CVP:** Not necessary unless large blood loss or prolonged surgery are anticipated.  
  
**A-line:** Required. For aneurysm surgery, normally inserted following induction.  
  
**ABGs:** A baseline ABG is commonly drawn prior to incision and every two hours.  
**Neuro Monitoring:** Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), motor evoked potentials (MEP), and electromyography (EMG).  
**  
Neuromonitoring:  
**Somatosensory Evoked Potentials or SEP: < 0.5MAC is best; muscle relaxation is acceptable.  
Motor Evoked Potentials or MEP (Transcranial motor evoked potentials or TceMEP or Cortical motor evoked potentials or CMAP): < 0.5 MAC is best; do not paralyze.  
EMG: Full MAC is OK, do not paralyze.  
  
**Positioning:** Patient position must be determined in advance. Frontal, temporal, and parieto-occipital craniotomies are done in supine position.  
The head is elevated 15-30 degrees to facilitate venous drainage and drainage of CSF.  
Ensure that the patient's head is not flexed or rotated too far because this could decrease jugular venous drainage and increase ICP.  
Ensure that ventilation tubing and IV or monitoring line tubing is correctly positioned to prevent disruption when the operating table is rotated 180 degrees for surgical access to the head. Positioning methods and methods to protect lines vary across practices as does arm positioning.  
  
**If patient is in prone position  
**A reinforced endotracheal tube is advised to prevent possible kinking that may occur when the head is flexed chin to chest.  
Arms will be tucked. Ensure access to and functioning of IV tubing.  
**Note:** Scissors can be used to carefully cut through sections of the arm wrapping to access IV ports and for trouble shooting.  
**Head stability:** The head is securely position on towels, in a cerebellar head rest or placed in three fixation points (Mayfield head pins).  
**Mayfield Pins and Propofol:** The application of Mayfield pins is very stimulating.  
A common strategy to deepen anesthesia for this procedure is to administer a bolus of propofol.  
  
**Intra-Op Maintenance**  
Verify required positioning with the operating team.  
Anesthetic agents, infusions and opioids must be titrated to achieve the target blood pressure. Crystalloid boluses must not be used to correct hypotension.  
  
**Ventilation:** Mild hyperventilation to achieve ETCO 2 between 30-35 mmHg.  
**Note:** For every 1 mmHg decrease in PaCO­ 2 , CBF decreases by 1-2 mL per 100g/min, which is usually adequate to offset the vasodilatory effects of volatile anesthetics.  
  
**Avoid Peep greater than 10cm:** Higher values could decrease venous drainage and increase ICP.  
**ABGs:** A baseline ABG is used to verify PaCO 2 and to determine the correlation with end-tidal and arterial PCO 2.  
  
Consider switching to lactated ringers if metabolic acidosis is present. There is a potential for hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis if normal saline is infused. This is very rare.  
**Blood Loss:** Should be replaced at a 3:1 ratio (3L crystalloids for every liter EBL) to achieve a hematocrit of 25-30%.  
**Brain Protection Meds may be ordered by the surgeon.  
**Determine and prepare for the surgeon's preference for neuroprotective measures. Some of the medications and doses used for this purpose are discussed below.  
  
**Mannitol:** 0.25-1mg/kg (25-50g) prior to opening the dura.**Lasix:** usually 10-20mg prior to opening the dura.  
**Steroids:** Usually dexamethasone (Decadron®) or Solu Medrol. 10mg Q2 hours is not unusual.  
**Phenytoin (Dilantin** ®): 1g; rarely used. Must not be given as a bolus.  
  
**Levetiracetam (Keppra** ®): An anticonvulsant coming into common use for this indication.  
  
**After Dura Incision:** Anesthetic requirements decrease substantially because the brain has no pain receptors. At this point, propofol 50-150mcg/kg/min with remifentanil 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg/min will be adequate without delaying emergence.  
**Reversal:** Delay reversal of muscle relaxant until dressing application is complete.  
  
Sugammadex is preferred over neostigmine and glycopyrrolate because of decreased potential for nausea. Postoperative hemorrhage is more likely if hypertension is present during emergence; thus, bucking and hypertension must be avoided.  
  
**Emergence Recommendations:** The surgical team's preference for extubation should be determined beforehand and planned for. Deep extubation is appropriate unless airway management was difficult or if reintubation is predicted to be difficult. A neurologic examination prior to leaving the operating room is rarely necessary. A patient who arrived in the operating room intubated will remain intubated postoperatively.  
  
**Drugs commonly used during emergence from anesthesia for craniotomy  
Lidocaine:** 1.5 mg/kg 1-2 minutes prior to suctioning and extubation.**Labetalol:** 20-60 mg with emergence if the BP permits.  
**Dexmedetomidine (Precedex** ®) Infusion may also be used.  
It is becoming more commonly used for this purpose. Common dexmedetomidine  
infusion dose range is between 0.2-1 mg/kg/hr. It is commonly diluted to 4 mcg/ml and  
infusion rate calculated appropriately based on patient weight.  
**Antiemetics:** PONV is very common after craniotomy. Prophylactic antiemetic given shortly before emergence reduces PONV.  
Ondansetron (Zofran®) 4 mg is the most commonly used.**  
  
Failure to regain consciousness may result from:**  
Elevated ICP  
Residual anesthesia or paralysis  
CO 2 narcosis, hypoxia, and hypercarbia.  
Emergence may be facilitated by administering physostigmine (0.01-0.03 mg/kg) and/or naloxone (Narcan®) (0.04 - 0.4 mg).  
Patient monitoring of recovery is, however, preferable to rapid emergence.  
  
**More Notes  
Isoflurane's neuroprotective properties result from two mechanisms:**  
It reduces excitatory neurotransmitters release by a presynaptic mechanism, an effect comparable to hypothermia (K Nakashima et al 1996).  
It decreases neuronal metabolism by a nontoxic mechanism.  
It can induce EEG isoelectricity at non-toxic concentrations of 2 MAC.  
A combination of isoflurane inhalation with intravenous opioid is becoming more commonly used.  
**Mayfield Pin Complications**  
Severe hypertension during application.  
Over tightening resulting in skull fracture.  
Bleeding requiring suturing.  
Laceration may result from inadequately tightened pins.  
  
**Nitroprusside**  
Vasodilates both cerebral arteries and veins, increasing ICP.  
Inhibits the normal vasoconstrictive response to hypocapnia.  
**Nitroglycerin  
**Causes cerebral venodilation, increasing ICP.  
Impairs vasodilatory response to hypercapnia.  
**Hydralazine (varying effects)**  
Vasodilates cerebral arteries more than it does cerebral veins.  
Impairs cerebral autoregulation.  
**Nicardipine**  
Other calcium channel blockers increase ICP by vasodilating arteries.  
Has been used to treat vasospasm in SAH.  
Increases cerebral blood flow in patients with SAH and acute stroke.  
In patients with ischemic stroke or intracerebral pathology, labetalol or esmolol may be used to lower blood pressure without raising ICP.  
  
Nicardipine is recommended for use in patients with ischemic stroke or SAH but not in patients with brain injury.  
  
If the patient has NO structural abnormalities, but has hypertensive encephalopathy, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, labetalol, esmolol, or nicardipine may be used.
