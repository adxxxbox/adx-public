### Platelet Inhibitors

**Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Inhibitors**  
GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors are a class of platelet inhibitors which function by binding to and blocking GPIIb/IIIa receptors (fibrinogen receptors) on the surface of platelets.  
  
By preventing the GPIIb/IIIa molecule from interacting with fibrinogen, platelet aggregation is inhibited.  
  
These drugs DO NOT inhibit platelet activation, but do inhibit platelet aggregation.  
  
**GP IIb/IIIa Inhibitors:**  
Abciximab (Reopro)  
Eptifibatide (Integrilin)  
Tirofiban (Aggrastat)  
  
**Cyclooxygenase (COX) Inhibitor**  
Low-dose, long-term aspirin is an irreversible platelet inhibitor.  
Aspirin is the prototype NSAID and functions by irreversibly inhibiting cyclooxygenases.  
Irreversibly meaning the life span of the platelets.  
Other NSAIDS are reversible platelets inhibitors.  
  
COX converts Arachidonic Acid to a variety of prostoglandins and thromboxanes.  
By blocking formation of thromboxane A 2 in platelets, this produces an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation.  
  
**ADP Receptor/P2Y12 Inhibitor  
**When the P2Y 12 platelet receptor interacts with ADP, it inhibits the GPIIb/IIIa receptors on the surface of the platelets from binding with fibrinogen for platelet aggregation.  
**Remember:** Fibrinogen links all the platelets together for platelet aggregation.  
  
**ADP Receptor/P2Y12 Inhibitors**  
Clopidogrel (Plavix, Duoplavin)  
Prasugrel (Effient, Efient)  
Ticagrelor (Brilligue)  
Ticlopidin (Ticlid)  
  
Clopidogrel and Prasugrel are prodrugs, meaning it is their metabolites that do the work.  
  
**Prostaglandin Analogue (PG12)  
**Prostacyclin activates adenylate cyclase, raising the cyclic AMP level in platelets.  
This indirectly decreases ADH levels and we know that ADH is a platelet activator that increases the binding between the GIIb/IIIa receptors on the surface of platelets and fibrinogen for platelet aggregation.  
  
**Prostaglandin Analogue (PG12)  
**Prostacyclin (Folan)  
Lloprost (Ilomedian)  
  
**Phosphodiester Inhibitors  
**Exact mechanism is unknown.  
Cilostazol and its metabolites probably inhibits PDE III activity, thereby suppressing cAMP degradation (decreasing ADP levels). ADP is needed for GPIIb/IIIa receptors on the surface of the platelets to bind with fibrinogen for platelet aggregation.  
  
Phosphodiesterase is a ubiquitous enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds. It is responsible for the hydrolysis of cyclic 3,5 adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and 3,5 cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)  
  
**Phosphodiester Inhibitors**  
Cilostazol (Pletal)
