### Combined Spinal Epidural – Step by Step

_By Lisa Stiel Moreno, CRNA_

**Preparation of Equipment** Obtain medications-Spinal meds do not come with the CSE kit.  
**Most institutions have a CSE kit that contains:**  
A CSF Tuohy needle (different than regular Tuohy)  
Compatible 5 inch 25g or 27g Spinal needle  
Syringe to administer the spinal medications  
**CSE Touhy** A CSE Tuohy has an extra lumen in its heel (underside of the bevel) to allow the passage of the spinal needle; whereas a regular Tuohy that comes in the conventional epidural kit does not have this feature _._  
  
**CSE Step by StepIn outlining the steps for a CSE, I am assuming the following below is already completed:**  
Preoperative assessment has been performed  
No contraindications  
Informed consents have been obtained  
Patient has been positioned in either the lateral or seated position  
Patient’s vital signs are being monitored appropriately.  
  
**The steps of the procedure are as follows:  
  
**1.  
**Open the dressings** that you will use to secure the epidural at the end of procedure  
This step is probably the easiest to overlook since you will be so concerned with getting all of the other required equipment. Remember that this is similar to an epidural placement with a couple of extra steps.  
Don’t forget the basics.  
For the dressings, I use tegaderm, but there are a number of ways to secure an epidural catheter. Make sure these dressings are close by.  
This is not a time that you are going to want to get fancy with your dressing.  
Most people will just tape it up as quickly as possible and can redress it after the C-section if they want.  
  
2.  
**Open the epidural tray and then open the extra CSE kit.  
**Empty its contents into the tray. Be sure to keep the Tuohy that comes with the epidural tray out of the way so as not to confuse the CSE Touhy needle.  
Always make sure the epidural catheter from your epidural kit can slide through the CSE Tuohy.  
Occasionally you will find an 18G CSE Tuohy and if your epidural kit has an 18G catheter, clearly that isn’t going to work.  
  
3.  
**Draw up the medications that you will be using for the spinal portion of your CSE.  
**Some people draw those medications up prior in a nonsterile syringe. Once the provider is sterile, they hold up an empty sterile syringe (w/o needle) for their assistant to inject the spinal medications into. That method requires another person to help you, and unfortunately there is not always someone available.  
Personally, I open my vial of Marcaine and place it on a nearby surface. I then draw up my narcotics, and once I open my kit. I will inject my narcotics into an empty well on the tray. After I am sterile, I will draw up the correct amount of local anesthetic and then draw up the narcotics. It is up to you to determine which method works for your purposes.  
  
4.Prep skin, drape, and localize as you normally would. This is also a good time to line up your equipment in the order that you will use it.  
  
5.  
Insert your CSE Tuohy needle and obtain your loss of resistance (LOR).  
(Note: the epidural needle acts as spinal needle introducer as far as the epidural space)  
**Once I have LOR, this is when I ensure all of my next steps are lined up to be efficient.**  
Once the spinal medications are injected the clock starts ticking. You do not want waste precious time searching in your kit for something that may have been moved or covered up.  
_Note: Once the spinal medication is injected, the longer the patient is sitting upright, the less likely for an adequate spread. So the epidural catheter insertion needs to be efficient.  
  
_6.  
Insert the SPINAL needle until you feel the pop as it penetrates the dura. If no CSF is present, then the epidural needle may be lateral and requires repositioning to midline.  
Once CSF is present, then inject the medication for your spinal.  
_Again, you have multiple syringes on your tray, so be aware and be diligent that you are injecting the correct syringe._  
  
7.  
Once the SPINAL medications have been injected, quickly remove the spinal needle and insert your epidural catheter through the epidural needle that is still positioned in the epidural space.  
  
**If you CAN NOT thread the epidural catheter:** An attempt can be made to dilate the space with saline.  
If you are still unable to thread the catheter, then a quick decision must be made about what you need more, the spinal or the epidural.  
If you lose time (after spinal meds are injected while the patient is still in the sitting position) by continuing to attempt the epidural, then the spinal may set up too low and be inadequate for the C- section.  
This is not catastrophic though because the epidural can be used to raise the block a bit higher. If you abort the epidural and just proceed with the spinal, then an epidural can be placed post operatively if the intention was to use it for post-op pain control.  
If the epidural was intended prolong a block for a possible long C-section, then be prepared to convert to general when the spinal starts to wear off during the C-section. The patient will definitely let you know.  
  
**Can you attempt another epidural if you can’t thread the catheter?**  
You can, but time is of the essence.  
If it takes you too long to reattempt another catheter insertion, then your spinal will not achieve and adequate sensory level while the patient is still sitting up.  
If you successfully insert the epidural catheter on the 2nd attempt, then an inadequate spinal is not an issue because you can dose the epidural to achieve a higher block.  
  
8.  
Once the epidural is in place, tape it securely as rapidly as possible.  
  
9.  
Quickly lay your patient back down, and assess the effect.
