### Neurological Injury

  
_Daniel D. Moos, CRNA_  
(extremely rare with an incidence of 0.08-0.16%)

Can be a transient or permanent.  
Avoid trauma to the nerve roots or spinal cord.  
Appropriate anatomical landmarks should be identified prior to the initiation of neuraxial blockade. Measures include the following:  
  
**Document pre-procedural neurological deficits**  
Does the patient suffer from neuropathy, chronic/acute low back pain, sensory, and/or motor deficits?  
Document conditions that may contribute to postoperative neurological deficits such as peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, intervertebral disk disease, and spinal/neurological disorders.  
  
**Perform Spinals below L2  
**Subarachnoid techniques should be performed below L2 in adults and L3 in children, where the spinal column ends.  
  
**Avoid Multiple Attempts  
**Multiple Attempts increase the incidence of trauma.  
Avoid this by carefully positioning the patient, noting anatomical landmarks, taking your time, and being deliberate when performing neuraxial techniques. Don’t be afraid to ask for help from another anesthesia provider if difficulties are encountered. Remove and redirect the needle when encountering a paresthesia. The incidence of encountering a paresthesia has been estimated to be 6%.  
**Paresthesia:** Patient states an extreme pain - from the needle having direct contact with nerve tissue.If pain is encountered during needle insertion, catheter insertion, or injecting medication, immediately stop. Direct injury to a spinal nerve root may cause permanent injury. Document the presence of paresthesia or pain during neuraxial blockade. Document the subjective description and if it was transient or prolonged. Alternatively, if the block was placed without a paresthesia or pain, document it.  
  
**Neurological Deficits  
**If a patient experiences a neurological deficit after neuraxial blockade, rule out an epidural hematoma or abscess. Neurological deficits may occur related to surgical positioning, improper positioning in the postoperative period, or as a result of direct trauma related to the surgical procedure.  
  
Obstetric patients are at risk for neurological deficits related to cesarean section or normal vaginal delivery. Carefully document the signs and symptoms that the patient is experiencing.  
**For example:** Is the patient experiencing a peripheral neuropathy in the distribution of the neuraxial block? Often these symptoms are transient. Is the patient experiencing severe symptoms such as sharp back and leg pain? This may indicate the formation of a spinal/epidural hematoma or transient neurological symptoms. Is the patient experiencing a progression of numbness, motor weakness, and/or sphincter dysfunction? This may indicate the development of a spinal/epidural hematoma. Trauma and subsequent damage to the conus medullaris will result in isolated sacral dysfunction.  
  
**Symptoms include the following:**Paralysis of the biceps femoral muscle  
Sensory loss of the posterior thigh, perineal area, or great toes  
Bowel and/or bladder dysfunction  
  
**Postpartum Neurological Deficits  
**Postpartum neurological deficits unrelated to neuraxial techniques include lateral femoral cutaneous neuropathy, foot drop, and even paraplegia.  
After an initial evaluation it is reasonable to request a neurological consult.
