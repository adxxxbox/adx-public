About Torsade de Pointes

---

A polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with a characteristic twist of the QRS complex around the isoelectric baseline. It is also associated with a drop in MAP and associated with syncope. Although torsades de pointes is a rare If not treated,

it it can degenerate into VF

It is associated prolonged QT intervals.

Proloned QT intervals predispose the patient to an R-on-T phenomenon,

Hallmark- upward and downward deflection of the QRS complexes around the baseline.

The term **Torsade de Pointes** means "twisting about the points."

**Caused by:**

drugs which lengthen the QT interval such as quinidine

electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia

myocardial ischemia

**Treatment:**

Synchronized cardioversion is indicated when the patient is unstable.

IV magnesium

IV Potassium to correct an electrolyte imbalance

Overdrive pacing
