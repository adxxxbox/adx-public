### Rigid Bronchoscopy

The rigid bronchoscope is a rigid, straight, hollow metal tube that is available in several sizes. Its purpose is to provide access to the trachea and the mainstem bronchi.  
**Insertion:** Once the vocal cords have been visualized, the bronchoscope is turned 90 degrees vertically in order to pass through the vocal cords. This offers the least resistance and avoids damage to the vocal cords. After entering the upper trachea, the bronchoscope is turned back to its original neutral position.  
  
If a more detailed examination, washings, laser/photodynamic ablation, or stent insertion is required, a flexible bronchoscope can be inserted through the rigid bronchoscope.

**Indications for a Rigid Bronchoscopy:**  
To remove larger foreign bodies that a flexible scope could not.

Deeper biopsy specimen removal when fiber-optic bronchoscopy is inadequate.  
Washing and tumor staging.  
Bleeding or hemorrhage.  
Dilation of tracheal or bronchial strictures.  
Relief of airway obstruction.  
Insertion of stents.  
Pediatric bronchoscopy.  
Tracheobronchial laser therapy or other mechanical tumor ablation.

**Anesthetic**: General, but don’t intubate. The surgeon will insert his rigid scope as soon as your patient is deep enough and the bed is rotated towards him.  
Make sure you have the anesthesia circuit tubing fully extended and your ventilator tubing holder is out of the surgeon’s field. It helps to have all your lines already isolated to the proper side prior to induction so you are not scrambling to remove them the last second while rotating the bed immediately after induction.  
  
**Duration:** 5-40 minutes.  
**Induction:** lidocaine/ Propofol/ Anectine. Then immediately rotate the bed for the surgeon so the scope can be inserted before the Propofol wears off.  
**Position:** Supine with a shoulder roll; arms are usually tucked. Bed rotated 90 degrees.  

**Ventilation:** Ventilation is initiated via the side port of the rigid bronchoscope. Hand the ventilator tubing to the surgeon. There will be a leak and you will have to manually ventilate. It will still leak.  
**Inhalation Agent:** Sevoflurane. Sometimes the surgeon will request for you NOT to use gas because of the leak and it bothers some surgeons to have anesthetic gasses in their face. TIVA is a good alternative.

**Oral Airway:** Have one available on your table top. The doctor may need it to be able to mask ventilate with the expected desaturations.  
**Prevent/Treat Hypertension and Tachycardia:**

BP and HR often fluctuate strikingly during these procedures. Make sure everything you use is short acting. Turn your Sevoflurane up if surgeon does not mind.  
**Esmolol:** Consider 0.5mg/kg just prior to the insertion of the rigid scope. Consider small boluses of Propofol.  
**Remifentanil:**  Could be optimal. Start it at 0.5-1mcg/kg/min at least 8 minutes before the start of the procedure. Or the easiest is to just start the drip before induction.

**Propofol Infusion:** Yes. Slowly push some when needed because a 1-2% MAC of Sevoflurane usually does not blunt the gag reflex. I give 2-4 ccs every 1-2 minutes.  
**Fentanyl:** Be careful not to give too much because these can be short cases. Propofol wears off much quicker.  
  
**Local Anesthesia:** Sometimes the patient will receive a lidocaine nebulizer treatment, Cetacaine spray or an airway block to blunt the stimulation.  

**Mouth guard or gauze pads:** yes, the teeth need to be protected.  
**Antisialagogue:** Yes, Robinul of 0.1-0.2 mg IV pre-emergence or 0.2-0.3mg IM 1h pre-op.

**Decadron:** Yes, 4-12mg.  
 

**Drops in SaO2:**  Inform the surgeon when the SaO2 is dropping. He could remove the rigid scope and mask ventilate. Offer the oral airway on your table top.

**Possible Complications:**  
Vocal cord injury  
Pneumothorax  
Damage to teeth  
Episodes of desaturations, tachycardia and hypertension  
Gums, tracheal or bronchial tears  
Hemorrhage
