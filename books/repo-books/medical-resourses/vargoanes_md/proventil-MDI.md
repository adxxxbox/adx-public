# Proventil MDI

**Proventil (Albuterol) Inhaler**

Also known as "MDI" (metered-dose inhaler)  
**Class:** Beta 2 Adrenergic Bronchodilator  
**Dose:** 4 Puffs

**During surgery per OETT:** 4-8 puffs is common Remember-very little even reach the alveoli  
**Note:** If the inhaler is new, you should shake and prime it (squirt it a few times in the air).  
Also, with a properly taken10 minute AEROSOL treatment, only around 1-2 % of the aerosol drug even reaches the alveoli.  
So imagine how little the drug with an MDI reaches the alveoli. This is why we can give several puffs.

**Common Side Effects**  
Just like other other beta-adrenergic agonist, Proventil can increase the HR, BP and cause some small tremors. This is usually not an issue.

**Pseudohypokalemia.** Therapeutic doses reduce the plasma potassium concentration in healthy subjects by as much as 1.5mmol/L. This can be from a transient shift of potassium from serum to skeletal muscle. However, this type of hypokalemia can vanish within seconds to minutes due to the huge capacity of skeletal muscle Na+/K+ pumps and K+ channels.

**CONTRAINDICTIONS** Hypersensitivity to albuterol or any other PROVENTIL HFA components.  
Hypokalemia

**PRECAUTIONS**  
Albuterol , as with all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with:  
Cardiovascular disorders  
Coronary insufficiency  
Cardiac Arrhythmias  
HTN
