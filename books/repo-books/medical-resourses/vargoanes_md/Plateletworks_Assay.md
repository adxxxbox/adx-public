### Plateletworks Assay

Plateletworks provides a CBC with platelet count plus information about platelet aggregation (or inhibition, depending on your perspective).  
  
Based on the measurement of platelet count before and after aggregation.  
**Plateletworks Analyzer works in a 2-step method:  
First** it measures **baseline** platelet count **(BPC)  
Second,** the analyzer repeats another platelet sample that has been exposed to a known platelet agonist (collagen, ADP and AA) AA= Arachidonic Acid.  
The agonist stimulates functional platelets to aggregate into clumps. The remaining non-aggregated platelets are recounted. The difference between the first baseline platelets count and second agonist platelet count **(APC)** provides a direct measurement of platelet aggregation.  
  
_Platelet count must be at least 27,000 for this analyzer._  
  
**Percentage of platelet aggregation** **\=** \[ (BPC-APC) / BPC \] x 100  
**Percentage of platelet inhibition =** (APC/BPC) x 100

| Assay | Reference Range |
| --- | --- |
| AA (arachidonic acid) | 60-100 % aggregation |
| ADP | 86-100 % aggregation |
| Collagen | 70-100 % aggregation |

Turnaround is about 5 minutes using traditional agonists including ADP, collagen and arachidonic acid and a standard impedance cell counter. All reagents are of non-human origin.

Specimen Requirements  
**A 2.5 ml sample of fresh whole blood for testing (1.0 ml for baseline tube and 1.0 ml for agonist tube).  
  
**Disadvantage of Plateletworks Assay Analyzer  
**Analyzer must be nearby.  
Once the blood specimen is drawn, the test should be performed within a few minutes. The need for this strict time interval has relegated this analysis to restricted operating areas such as cardiac surgery and cardiac operating room.   
  
**Interferences that may affect Plateletworks values  
**Pseudothrombocytopenia  
Cell counters utilizing electronic impedance cell counting principles may be subject to known interfering substances which can impact platelet count results.  
  
**These include:** Microcytes, schizocytes, and WBC fragments, which may interfere with the proper counting of platelets and cause elevated platelet counts.  
  
Agglutinated erythrocytes, which may trap platelets and cause an erroneously low platelet count.  
  
Giant platelets, which may cause an erroneously low platelet count since they may exceed the upper limit threshold for the platelet parameter.  
  
Chemotherapy, which may increase the fragility of platelets and cause low platelet counts.  
  
Hemolysis, which produces red cell stroma and may elevate platelet counts.  
  
Acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD) blood, which may contain platelet aggregates that could depress the platelet count.  
  
RBC inclusions, which may produce a spuriously increased platelet count.  
  
Platelet agglutination, due to poor collection techniques or EDTA activation, which may cause a decreased platelet count.
