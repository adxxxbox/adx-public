# Hespan

**6% Hespan (Hetastarch, Hydroxyethyl Starch, HES)**  

Black Box Warning by the FDA concerning Hespan and Voluven. HES solutions increase a patient’s risk of rapid loss of kidney function. We no longer administer Hespan or Voluven. Albumin is our colloid of choice.

Below is the old literature.

**Hespan** is basically Hetastarch in NS.

**Hextend** is Hetastarch in LR.

A synthetic colloid available as a 6% solution in NS. Synthetic plasma expander.  
**Hydroxyethyl starch:** a derivative of thin boiling waxy corn starch. Average volume expansion and clinical effect: 6-8 hours

**Also contains:** Na 154mEq/L Cl 154mEq/L potassium and magnesium.

**Doses:**  
**Standard:** 500-1,000mL.  
We usually limit to 1 Liter.  
\>1 liter is said to effect bleeding times.  
Not to exceed 1500 mL/day (20 mL/kg).  
Doses higher than 20 mL/kg/24h increase the risk of circulatory overload, especially with impaired renal function.  
**If CrCl <10 mL/min:** Follow a regular initial dose and reduce subsequent doses by 20-50% of normal. Caution with compromised kidneys. HESPAN is not eliminated by hemodialysis.

**Anesthesia Indications** For the treatment of hypovolemia when plasma volume expansion is desired. It is not a substitute for blood or plasma.

**Average molecular wt:** Molecules vary in size depending what literature you read.

**Excretion:** primarily the kidneys.  
**Molecules: 600 - 700 kD:** Rapidly renally excreted.  
**Molecules > 600 - 700 kD:** Metabolized amylase prior to renal excretion.  
62% of the Hespan dose is excreted as the original molecules in the urine within 72 hours.  
Plasma levels remain at 75% of peak concentration at 30 minutes post infusion and decrease to 14% at 6 hours post infusion.

**Volume of Distribution:** 5.9 L  
A single dose of 500 mLs of HESPAN (approximately 30 g) results in elimination in the urine of approximately 33% of the dose within 24 hours. However, one article states that plasma levels returned to baseline levels 24 hours after infusion.

**Oncotic pressure:** 30mmHg Has a higher COP than 5% Albumin, but not 25% Albumin. Much cheaper than Albumin.

**Disadvantages** It increases serum amylase, sometimes 2-3 times. Dilutes coagulants, over 1 Liter is said to effect bleeding times. Hespan derivatives have been demonstrated to have increased rates of acute renal failure and need for renal replacement therapy and to decrease long-term survival when used alone in cases of severe sepsis compared with Ringer lactate solution.

**Contraindications** In patients with known hypersensitivity to hydroxyethyl starch (HES). Clinical conditions where volume overload is a potential problem, such as, CHF or renal disease with anuria or oliguria not related to hypovolemia. Large volumes of may transiently alter the coagulation mechanism due to hemodilution and a direct inhibitory action on Factor VIII. Patients with hypernatremia and hyperchloremia. Patients with intracranial bleeds. Patients receiving dialysis.

**Caution:** For patients allergic to corn because such patients can also be allergic to hetastarch. Renal patients with CrCl <10 mL/min Patients with kidney failure not related to low blood volume and patients on dialysis should avoid this product in high doses, which are used for volume expansion. Indirect bilirubin levels of 8.3 mg/L (normal 0.0–7.0 mg/L) have been reported in 2 out of 20 normal subjects who received multiple infusions.

**Anaphylactoid reactions** Mild influenza-like symptoms Bradycardia Tachycardia bronchospasm Noncardiac pulmonary edema
