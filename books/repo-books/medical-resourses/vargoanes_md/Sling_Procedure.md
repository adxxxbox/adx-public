### Sling Procedure/Vaginal Sling/Pubo-Vaginal Sling

The urethral sling surgeries involve placing a sling around the urethra to lift it back into a normal position and to exert pressure on the urethra to aid urinary retention. The sling is attached to the abdominal wall.  
The sling material may be muscle, ligament, or tendon tissue taken from the woman or a pig graft. It may also be composed of synthetic material such as delicate plastic that is compatible with body tissues or of an absorbable polymer that eventually disintegrates.  

**Indications:**  
Urinary incontinence.  
Urethral hypermobility.  
Intrinsic sphincter deficiency.  
  
**Anesthesia:** General/ETT or spinal.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Usually.  
**Position:** Lithotomy.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours.  
**EBL:** Minimal.  
**Incision site:** Vaginal or lower abdominal..  
**Cystoscopy at the end:** Yes.  
**Foley:** Yes.  
  
**Methods:**  
Needle Suspension.  
Percutaneous approach.  
Vaginal Tape.  
Transvaginal Anchor.  
Vesico-Urethral Suspension.  

**Possible Complications:**  
Bleeding.  
Infection.  
Erosion or infection of the graft material (possibly requiring further surgery).  
Injury to nearby structures.  
Urinary retention.  
Recurrent or worsening incontinence..  
New onset or worsening vaginal prolapse.  
Urgency or urge-to-void type of incontinence.  
  
**More Notes:**  
The standard retropubic and transobturator slings last 10-15 years and are considered the gold standard..  
Newer materials and a needle approach through the skin with minimal cutting, along with  
“tension-free” placement in the mid-urethra, have led to these operations becoming the  
most popular procedures in the United States and Europe.  
  
**Stress Incontinence Facts:**  
10-30% of women experience incontinence during their lifetime.  
  
**Risk Factors for Incontinence:**  
Women who have 3 or more children.  
Women who were given oxytocin to induce labor.  
Women who smoke have twice the rate of incontinence.  
Gymnasts, softball, volleyball, and basketball players.  
Women with Diabetes and Obesity.
