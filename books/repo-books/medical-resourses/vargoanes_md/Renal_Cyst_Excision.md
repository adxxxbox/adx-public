### Renal Cyst –Excision, Laparoscopic

This is a rare case because renal cysts usually do not get big. Renal cysts are so common that they are encountered in daily radiological practice. Renal cysts occur in 50 % of adults and 66% of people over 80 years old, but the literature varies on the percentages. The cause of these cysts is unknown. The cysts can grow larger than the kidney and also become complicated, leading to hemorrhage, infection and ischemia.  
Simple cysts: are benign and fluid filled, spherical in shape.  
Complex cyst: are irregularly shaped and may be suspicious for cancer. They are thicker and most are vascular.  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
**A-line:** Usually not for a healthy patient with a simple cyst. If the surgeon tells you the cyst is vascular, consider an A-line. Ask the surgeon what the patient’s EBL might be. The surgeon has seen all the scans and has more information than you.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Yes.  
**Nitrous Oxide:** No; it can expand the bowel and get in the way of laparoscopic visualization and access to the renal cyst.  
**IV Access:** 1-2 large bore for potential blood loss.  
**Neosynephrine Drip:** Have available.  
**Position:** Lateral or transperitoneal approach with an axillary roll.  
**Kidney Rest:** Up, thus “breaking” the table in the middle. This is used to widen the gap between the 12th rib and the iliac crest of the hip, thereby improving surgical access. The patient’s waist should be over the middle break in the OR table.  
**EBL:** 50-750mLs. It all depends on the vascularity of the cyst and the surgeon’s experience.  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**Possible Complications:** Hemorrhage and infection.

**More Notes:**  
Renal cysts can be classified according to the Bosniak classification depending on their features. This is a CT classification only, since the cyst has not been visualized yet. Like most things in X-Ray, my motto is Prepare for the Worst, be surprised if radiology is actually correct, and don’t get your hopes up.  
**Type I:** A simple benign and thin walled cyst. It does not contain septa, calcifications, or solid material. Septa are divisions within walls of the cyst. The cyst has a density similar to that of water. Looks like a small water balloon. No vascularity. 0% malignant.

**Type II:** A benign cyst that contains a few thin septa. Fine calcifications exist in the cyst wall or in the septa. Lesions less than 3cm may have sharp edges. Not vascular. 0% malignancy. Type I and II can be ignored for cancer worries. Not surgical candidates.  
  
**Type IIF:** The F stands for Follow up. Similar to above, except the lesions are greater than 3 cm.  
  
**Type III and IV** are surgical lesions. Type IV is inevitably malignant and in the type III group about 80-90% turns out to be malignant as well. Both are vascular.

**Cysts can cause pain due to:**  
Growth and stretching of the wall of the cyst. Pressure on the kidney.  
Pressure on the drainage of the kidney, causing blockage. Pressure on other organs (stomach, intestines).  
  
Rarely, cysts can bleed, rupture, or become infected.
