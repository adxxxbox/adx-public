### D-Dimer

_An elevated D-dimer is an important tool for the diagnosis of DVT, PE and DIC.  
Has a high rate of false positives, which limits its use._  
  
D-dimers are protein products of cross-linked fibrin degradation that are present in the blood of most healthy individuals in only negligible amounts (100-200 ng/mL).  
It is an objective evidence of increased fibrinolysis.  
Elevated levels of D-dimer display evidence of intravascular coagulation and thrombotic disease.  
  
D-dimers are produced during fibrinolysis, which is degradation of the fibrin cross links.  
D-dimer represents the lysis of fibrin rather than fibrinogen.  
  
Although elevation of D-dimer is invariably evident in those with VTE, it can also be evident in many other conditions that are associated with a pro-coagulant state; so that a positive D-dimer test cannot be used to diagnose VTE. Further imaging testing is required to either confirm or exclude VTE.  
  
However, a negative D-dimer test can be used to reliably exclude VTE among patients whose pre-test probability of VTE (based on clinical assessment) is low. Application of the test in this way allows rapid exclusion of VTE without the necessity for expensive, time-consuming imaging tests.  
  
**Unfortunately, a low specificity limits the usefulness of D-dimer testing.**  
Specificity is typically between 40% and 60%, leading to a high rate of false-positive results.  
  
Several factors, other than PE or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), are associated with positive D-dimer results. Some, such as advanced age, malignancy, and pregnancy, have been described in the medical literature.
