### Transient Neurological Symptoms (TNS)

  
_Daniel D. Moos, CRNA_

Transient neurological symptoms, or TNS, have been called transient radicular irritation in the past. It is a relatively new diagnosis, first described in 1993.  
  
**Signs and symptoms of TNS include:  
**Low back pain with radiation to the legs.  
  
Signs and symptoms occur after the spinal anesthetic has regressed and normal sensation has returned.  
It can occur between 1 and 24 hours and generally subsides after several days.  
  
There are no sensory or motor symptoms.  
  
All local anesthetics have been associated with TNS.  
  
There is an occasional report of TNS after epidural anesthesia.  
  
The incidence is highest with spinal lidocaine.  
  
This has prompted many in the anesthesia communities to abandon the use of high concentrations of lidocaine as a spinal anesthetic. On the other hand, it has left the anesthesia community with few short acting local anesthetic agents. Procaine is often too short lived. Prilocaine has a relative high incidence of nausea and vomiting. Mepivacaine has a similar profile to lidocaine, both for duration and the incidence of TNS. The exact mechanism is not known. It is theorized that lidocaine is more neurotoxic to the unsheathed nerve than other local anesthetics.  
  
**Two factors contributing to the incidence of TNS:  
**Positioning  
Early ambulation.  
  
TNS is more common in patients that have received a spinal anesthetic and are then placed in a lithotomy position. This position may cause lumbosacral nerve root stretching, decreasing perfusion and making nerves more susceptible to toxic effects of local anesthetics. Knee arthroscopies are one of the most common surgical procedures associated with TNS.  
  
Prevention largely lies with avoiding lidocaine, which has the highest incidence.  
  
Bupivacaine is an excellent alternative. However, if only lidocaine is available the anesthesia provider must weigh the risk/benefit since TNS is a transient complication. It is important to closely monitor positioning when placing a patient in lithotomy position. Patients undergoing ambulatory surgical procedures or procedures in the lithotomy position should be informed that this complication can occur. Treatment is symptomatic and short lived.
