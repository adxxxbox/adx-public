### Thyroid Gland Changes with Pregnancy

The thyroid gland can increase in size by almost 20% during pregnancy, which can affect patients with preexisting goiters.Increasing levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (Hcg) stimulates thyroid-stimulating receptors (TSH) in the anterior pituitary as the subunits of TSH and HCG are both identical. This leads to a transient hyperthyroidism. T3 and T4 increases and peaks mid-gestation.  
Most studies show there is really no difference between pre-pregnancy and pregnancy thyroid levels and being in a euthyroid state. However, most of the cases of true hyperthyroidism in pregnancy are usually only due to Graves' disease.  
  
**A parturient with thyrotoxicosis is very rare and requires:**  
Careful airway evaluation  
ECG  
A-line  
Hydration corrections  
Correction of electrolyte and glucose abnormalities  
Avoid sympathetic stimulation  
  
These patients are usually admitted to an ICU unit postpartum for monitoring.
