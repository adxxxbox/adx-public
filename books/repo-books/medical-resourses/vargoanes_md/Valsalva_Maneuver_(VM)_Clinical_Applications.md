### Valsalva Maneuver (VM) Clinical Applications

**Replication of Valsalva maneuver under anesthesia**  
The **Valsalva maneuver** can also be performed on anesthetized and intubated patients.  
A passive **Valsalva maneuver** can be performed under anesthesia by squeezing the reservoir bag of the Bain's breathing circuit to maintain a sustained airway pressure of 40 mmHg for 10 seconds at a time.  
In reality, we only use 20-30 mmHg for about a 5 second inspiratory hold.  
  
**Central venous cannulation:  
**A VM causes a substantial increase in the vascular lumen, especially in those patients in whom the vessel is found to be collapsed (e.g. in hypovolemic patients).  
The VM significantly increases the cross-sectional area of central veins (>20%), reduces their collapsibility and opens their valves, thereby increasing the success rates of central venous cannulation.  
reduces the kinking and locking of the guide wires.  
VM decreases the chances of air embolism during the placement of the venous cannula as well as during the removal of the central venous catheters.   
  
**Decreasing pain with IV cannulation**  
VM before venous cannulation and observed a significant reduction not only in the severity of pain but also in the number of patients in whom one needed to make the vein prominent before cannulation in adults and children.  
A significant reduction in the incidence and severity of pain with venipuncture in kids aged 6–12 years when inflating a balloon when compared with those children whose attention was distracted.  
  
**Detecting the integrity of dural repair:**  
A VM is commonly requested by the spinal surgeon to assess for detectable CSF after a dura repair.  
During Phase I of VM, there is an increase in ICP, which is also transmitted to the spinal cord.  
The increased pressure can lead to seepage of CSF from a compromised dura and arachnoid.  
The absence of CSF with a VM tells the surgeon the dural closure is watertight and there would be no subsequent cerebrospinal fluid leakage from the wound.  
  
**Assess for diagnose inadvertent dural tears dura tear during spinal surgeries  
**Leakage of CSF from the dura following application of the VM can be used to diagnose inadvertent dural tears following surgeries such as microdiscectomies.  
  
**Better visualization with transsphenoidal approach with pituitary surgeries  
**A VM may be utilized for better visualization and delineation of the suprasellar tumor.It causes descent of the pituitary gland, facilitating tumor resection.  
  
**To assess suprasellar arachnoidal breach during a transsphenoidal pituitary tumor resection  
**CSF rhinnorhea indicates suprasellar arachnoidal breach.A VM can be used to locate the site of a CSF leakage so that appropriate repair measures (fat graft, etc.) could be instituted at the focal point of the leakage.  
**  
Thyroid surgery  
**VM has been used to detect bleeding points during thyroid surgery.  
  
**VM can be used for the diagnosis of varicocele.  
  
Facilitate CO2 removal from the abdominal cavity after laparoscopic surgery  
**The surgeon will request a VM and pressure is applied on the abdomen to enhance CO2 removal from the trocar ports.  
  
**Other applicat** **ions of VM:  
Termination of Arrhythmias:** VM is also useful for termination of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) with variable success.  
Increased vagal activity, leading to increased refractoriness of AV nodal tissue interrupting re-entry, has been proposed as the mechanism for termination of PSVT.  
  
**Assessment of heart failure:** Patients with heart failure show an abnormal blood pressure overshoot in response to Valsalva maneuver due to impaired ventricular function.  
  
**Detecting of radicular or neuropathic pain of the cervical spine:**  
With a VM, the intraspinal pressure slightly increases.  
Thus, neuropathies or radicular pain may become manifest or exacerbated, and this may indicate an impingement of the nerve by an intervertebral disc, osteophytes, or bony compression.  
  
**Chiari Malformation:  
**Headache and nuchal pain upon performing the VM is also one of the hallmarks of Chiari Malformation.  
  
**Decreasing the pain during lumbar puncture  
**VM has been seen to reduce the skin puncture pain associated with needle insertion due to its action on controlling the nociceptive pain.  
The mechanism involves the increase in the intrathoracic pressure, which in turn results in baroreceptor activation. Activation of either the cardiopulmonary baroreceptor reflex arc or the sinoaortic baroreceptor reflex arc is believed to induce antinociception.  
  
**Diagnosis of murmurs:**  
**Murmur of aortic stenosis (AS):** Murmur is reduced in intensity on the administration of VM because reduced end-diastolic volume (EDV) diminishes the blood available for ejection through the stenosed aortic orifice.  
  
**Murmur of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM** ): The murmur accentuates in response to VM because reduced EDV during VM leads to the worsening of the obstruction in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
