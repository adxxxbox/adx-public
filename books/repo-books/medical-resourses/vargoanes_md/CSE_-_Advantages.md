### Combined Spinal Epidural Advantages

**_By Lisa Moreno, CRNA_**

It must be emphasized that CSE has, time and again, shown advantage for use in laboring parturients. In comparison with straight lumbar epidurals, fetal, neonatal and maternal side effects are not increased, and the risk of C-section is not increased.  
**  
Advantages and Uses of CSE:**  
There are many advantages and uses for the CSE, and it has shown itself to be a very fast, safe and effective technique, with wide- ranging applications.  
  
Fetal bradycardia may be associated with the CSE technique. However, the mode of delivery is unchanged when compared to epidural analgesia for labor.  
  
Specifically, the cesarean section rate is not higher in the CSE group.  
  
Motor block and pruritus may be increased, but usually only transiently, and can be reduced by combining an opioid with a local anesthetic, thereby reducing the total dose-requirement of each, through synergistic effects.  
  
**Reduction in failed epidural, unilateral block and dural punctures with CSE  
**The answer is quite simple.  
In order to get a good flow of CSF, the epidural needle must be in the epidural space and not a false space, and it must be fairly close to a perfect midline insertion point, reducing the risk of a failed or unilateral block.  
Finally, it reduces the incidence of wet tap because it allows the clinician to test if they are at a false loss of resistance by placing the spinal needle and looking for CSF after the loss of resistance, rather than advancing forward blindly. Thus, the spinal needle becomes like a “sounding device.”  
  
**_NOTE:_** _There may also be less sacral sparing with CSE, both because of the residual effect of the intrathecal injection and because of the dural puncture, through which some of the epidurally-administered agents enter the CSF. In fact, in one Japanese study, sacral sparing was less and pain scores lower with a dural puncture preceding the epidural injection, even when no intrathecal injection was carried out._ _Jim Carroll, CRNA  
  
_**More Advantages**  
Rapid onset of anesthesia/analgesia  
No increase in adverse effects (literature varies)  
Compared to continuous epidural infusion, PCEA results in a lower total dose of local  
anesthetics used over the course of labor.  
A decreased need to administer additional doses of anesthetic.  
A lower incidence of motor block.  
  
**Able to ambulate during labor** (in up to 80% of women) because it is not associated with impaired equilibrium (walking epidural with correct dose).  
  
**_NOTE:_** _Some authorities question this, citing a small but non-zero incidence of loss of proprioception with intrathecal narcotic injection, even without local anesthetics. I recall seeing a study in which volunteers given an intrathecal narcotic injection demonstrated more instability using a “balance board” after injection than under control conditions before injection. It is an individual decision for each provider, but at my institution, there is no walking after any neuraxial labor analgesia. At most, the patient is allowed use of the bedside commode, assisted by two healthcare providers. This is made plain to patients at their pre-delivery visit and interview weeks before term, and reinforced when they are contemplating neuraxial analgesia during labor._ _Jim Carroll, CRNA.  
  
_**You can re-dose with the epidural in place.** Having the epidural allows for re-dosing if the C-section or procedure goes longer than the duration of the spinal dose coverage.  
  
**PCEA can be used for post op pain control.  
**Unfortunately, substance abuse is a real problem in the obstetric population.  
In my experience, substance abusers have a higher incidence of C-sections. This means that you now have to manage post-operative pain on a non-opiate naive individual. Performing a CSE will provide a non-opiate method of pain control for this population.  
  
So, the evidence is overwhelming. CSE is the best technique for labor analgesia and other uses such as anticipated difficult C-sections, for multiple reasons which extend well beyond quick onset.  
  
It is well supported to use the technique in practically all laboring patients, in early or late labor, except in the few cases where a spinal should be avoided. For such a relatively simple technique, the benefits of CSE are tremendous.
