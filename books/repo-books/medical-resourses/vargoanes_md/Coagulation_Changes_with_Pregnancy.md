Coagulation Changes with Pregnancy    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Coagulation Changes with Pregnancy

Coagulation is affected in pregnancy with an increase in most of the coagulation factors but also an increase in fibrinolytic activity.  
The result is a HYPER-coagulated state increasing the occurrence of VTEs.  
Thromboembolic complications from thromboembolism is at least five times greater during pregnancy.  
Thromboembolic disease is a very common condition and is one of the most important causes of maternal mortality in developed countries.  
  
**Pregnant woman still using oral contraceptives  
**A pregnant woman using an oral contraceptive as compared to a nonpregnant woman NOT using oral contraceptives results in an increase of the risk of VTE by 1.5 times and 21 times by term.  
  
Platelet turnover ↑  
Platelet Count - WNL but may ↓ decrease a little by term.  
Fibrinogen ↑  
Fibrinolysis ↑  
Factor 2,7,8,9 10 and 12 ↑  
Factor 11 slight ↓  
Factor 13 ↓ by 50%.  
PT and PTT ↓  
INR - decreased <1 by week 20.  
Plasminogen ↑ by 50-60% by third trimester.  
D-dimer ↑ 3-5 fold by third trimester.  
  
The risk of thromboembolism persists until around 3 weeks postpartum.  
The hypercoagulable state facilitates clotting at the time of placental separation and prevents bleeding during pregnancy.  
There is a 10-fold risk of venous thrombosis and a 25-fold increase in the post-partum period. All clotting factors except XI and XIII are increased.  
Also there is a decrease in natural anticoagulants and fibrinolytic activity.  
**Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are becoming popular in pregnancy**  
LMWHs are being used increasingly in the antenatal period. If so, you need to find out when the last dose was before performing a regional anesthetic.  
  
**Platelets**  
Both the platelet production and destruction increases and peaks in the third trimester. The platelet count may be lower but still within normal limits due to hemodilution from an increase in plasma.  
  
**Severe Preeclampsia and Platelets**  
With severe preeclampsia, the platelet count can decrease rapidly, increasing the risk of an epidural hematoma.
