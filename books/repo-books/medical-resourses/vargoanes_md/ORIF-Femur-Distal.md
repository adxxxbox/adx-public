ORIF of the Femur - Supracondylar or Distal Fractures     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### ORIF of the Distal Femur

Supracondylar fractures of the femur account for approximately 7% of all femur fractures. They occur proximally just above the knee joint.  
This is basically a fracture at the lower portion of the femur.  
These fractures usually occur in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities.  
These are usually repaired by the standard ORIF.  
**Available Equipment:** Power drill, guide wires, plates, intramedullary rod set and a C-arm may be used.

These patients will arrive to surgery in traction to minimize the muscle spasms. The traction should not to be removed until the patient is asleep.

**Anesthetic: General/ETT.**

For Regional: A spinal is optional. Consider Propofol or a little Ketamine for positioning of the spinal due to pain.  
**Position:** Supine or Lateral, usually on a fracture table.  
**Neo Drip:** Yes, especially if a spinal is done. Most of these patients are old and volume depleted.  
**EBL:** 50-150 mLs.  
**IV Access:** 18 or 20G

**Complications:**

Bleeding  
Infection

Malunion

Nonunion

Loss of reduction of fracture  
Infection  
Wound complications 

DVT/PE
