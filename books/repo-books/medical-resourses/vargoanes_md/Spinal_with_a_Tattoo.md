### Spinal with a Tattoo

Reliable studies are not yet available on the long-term effects of dyes and heavy metals introduced by needles into the epidural and subarachnoid spaces.  
  
Some anesthesia providers still refuse to perform an epidural or spinal if they can't find tattoo-free skin to go through. The lower back tattoo is what we are concerned with in OB.  
  
**We are concerned about “Coring”** (so use a stylet)  
Coring is when the passage of a hollow bore needle through the dermis may theoretically introduce pigmented tissue into the epidural, subdural, and/or subarachnoid spaces.  
  
**This is why you should always use a stylet  
**Use a stylet and do not remove the stylet until the needles have passed through the superficial layers, making this scenario very unlikely.  
This reduces any possible risk associated with trapping tattoo pigment inside the needle or depositing the pigment into deeper tissues.  
  
Always warn the patient that there may be a small small scar that could alter the appearance of the tattoo.  
  
**_Red dyes contain mercury._  
  
Other Concerns  
**Is the tattoo recent? Always make sure the tattoo is healed.  
Older dyes (that appear blurry) the inks were organic and safer.  
Modern inks are more a metallic base.  
  
The ink in a tattoo is not in a fluid state, it has simply stained the skin, so it won't be flowing around because of a puncture.
