### Hormonal Changes With Pregnancy

**Progesterone and Estrogens**  
Progesterone and estrogen rise continually throughout pregnancy, suppressing the hypothalamic axis and subsequently the menstrual cycle.  
Estrogen is mainly produced by the placenta and is associated with fetal well–being.  
B-hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) is increased and is also produced by the placenta.  
  
An increased progesterone production is first due to the corpus luteum and later by the placenta.  
The elevated progesterone functions to relax bronchiolar smooth muscle and contributes to an increase in minute ventilation to 50% greater than non-pregnant levels.  
  
**Prolactin** levels increase due to maternal pituitary gland enlargement by 50%. This mediates a change in the structure of the mammary gland from ductal to lobular-alveolar.  
  
**Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)** is increased which leads to increases of calcium uptake in the gut and reabsorption by the kidney.  
  
**Adrenal hormones -** cortisol and aldosterone also increase.  
  
**Human placental lactogen (hPL)** is produced by the placenta and stimulates lipolysis and fatty acid metabolism. It conserves blood glucose for use by the fetus. It can also decrease maternal tissue sensitivity to insulin, resulting in gestational diabetes.  
  
**Aldosterone Actions are Enhanced  
**Enhanced aldosterone leads to increased water absorption, causing an increase in the volume of distribution and increased elimination half-life of certain drugs. Primary renal disease is uncommon with a healthy pregnancy. However, preeclampsia causes deterioration in renal function that warrants careful anesthetic approach with strict management of fluid balance, diabetic control, and adjustment of drug doses and regime.  
  
**Fetal Insulin vs Maternal Insulin** Fetal insulin levels are independent of maternal insulin production.  
However, fetal glucose levels are dependent on the maternal glucose levels and the glucose load available for placental transfer.  
Poor maternal glucose control can result in macrosomia in the fetus and neonatal hypoglycemia after delivery
