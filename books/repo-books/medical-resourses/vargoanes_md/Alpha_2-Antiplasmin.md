Alpha 2-Antiplasmin (α2AP) Deficiency    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Alpha 2-Antiplasmin (α2AP) Deficiency

α2AP prevents fibrinolysis (clot breakdown), so a deficiency will increase fibrinolysis and thus increase bleeding.  
Can be congenital (heterozygous and homozygous) or acquired.  
Acquired: from liver failure.  
  
**Causes of decreased levels of A2AP**  
DIC.  
Sepsis.  
Surgery.  
Liver failure.  
Asparaginase treatment may lower A2AP due to reduced synthesis.  
  
**Heterozygous antiplasmin deficiency:** mild  
Symptomatic patients may report mild bleeding similar to that found with PAI-1 deficiency above. Only about 20% of patients with heterozygous antiplasmin deficiency typically report bleeding problems, most are asymptomatic.  
  
**Homozygous antiplasmin deficiency:** severe  
More rare, resulting in moderate to severe bleeding characterized by umbilical stump bleeding, hemarthrosis, easy bruising, gingival bleeding and bleeding after minor dental or surgical procedures.  
  
**Diagnosis of** **Alpha-2-antiplasmin (** **α2AP) Deficiency**  
Draw citrate anticoagulated blood and check the antiplasmin activity.  
Homozygous antiplasmin deficiency has close to undetectable levels of activity.  
Heterozygous deficiency typically has antiplasmin activity levels from 35–70% of normal.  
  
**Treatment:** Tranexamic acid helps prevent the generation of plasmin and blocks its action.  
Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is a source of alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor.  
  
**Epidural Hematomas**  
Epidural Hematomas from 2-plasmin inhibitor deficiency (alpha-2-PI deficiency, a2-PI deficiency), must be coupled with plasma infusions to correct alpha-2-plasma inhibitor deficiency and with inhibitors of fibrinolysis (tranexamic acid) to prevent rebleeding.  
  
**Avoid NSAIDs**  
Serial laboratory assessments of the level of alpha-2-plasmin inhibitor (alpha-2-PI, a2-PI) must be performed in the postoperative period to ensure maintenance of adequate levels of over 70%.
