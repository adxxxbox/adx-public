### Orchiectomy

The removal of one or both testicles.

If cancer is not suspected, the testicle is removed through the scrotum.  
If cancer is suspected an inguinal orchiectomy is a necessary because the surgeon will also remove the retroperitoneal lymph nodes.  
A testicular prosthesis may be inserted.

**Indications:** testicular torsion, trauma or cancer.

**Two types or Orchiectomies:** Radical and Simple  
**Radical (inguinal):** When testicular cancer is suspected, the testicle along with the retroperitoneal lymph nodes are removed.  
**Simple:** The testicle is removed through a small incision made in the scrotum.

**Anesthetic:** General/LMA, some intubate.

Spinal is optional, but rare.  
**Duration:** 45-120 minutes

**Positioning:** Supine and legs apart or frog legged  
**Muscle relaxant:** No

**Vagal Bradycardia**: Pulling on the genitals can cause a vagal bradycardia. You should have Atropine and Robinul readily available. Alert him if there is a bradycardic episode so he could stop manipulating the genitals.

**EBL:** 20mLs  
  
**Possible Complications:**  
Infection  
Bleeding  
  
**More Notes:**  
Both testicles (bilateral orchiectomy) are usually removed if a decrease in testosterone is the desired outcome.

A simple orchiectomy may be done as a type of hormone therapy to help relieve symptoms, prevent complications, and prolong survival for advanced prostate cancer or to treat male breast cancer.

**How well it works Orchiectomy for testicular cancer** Orchiectomy is the most effective way to remove cancerous tumors of the testicles. In some cases, orchiectomy is followed by additional surgery to remove cancer that has spread or by other therapies such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy. For early-stage testicular cancer, orchiectomy may be the only treatment needed.

**Orchiectomy for advanced prostate cancer** Hormone therapy is the main treatment for advanced prostate cancer. Bilateral orchiectomy is the fastest and simplest way to block testosterone production. But because it is irreversible, many opt for drug therapy to reduce testosterone before surgery. Patients should discuss all options and associated risks carefully with their physician.

If cancer is not suspected, the testicle is removed through the scrotum.

If cancer is suspected an inguinal orchiectomy is a necessary because the surgeon will also remove the retroperitoneal lymph nodes.

Inguinal orchiectomy is the standard treatment for suspected testicular carcinoma.

If the orchiectomy is performed to diagnose cancer, the testicle and spermatic cord are then sent to a pathologist to determine the makeup of the tumor, and the extent of spread within the testicle and cord.

Inguinal orchiectomy and high spermatic cord ligation remain the standard of care for diagnosis and initial management of testicular cancer

Inguinal orchiectomy is the standard treatment for suspected testicular carcinoma.
