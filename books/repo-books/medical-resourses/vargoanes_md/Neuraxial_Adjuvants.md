### Neuraxial Adjuvants

Adjuvants are drugs that increase the efficacy or potency of other drugs when given concurrently.  
Neuraxial adjuvants are used to improve or prolong analgesia and decrease the adverse effects associated with high doses of a single local anesthetic agent. Some adjuvants will reduce latency time with neuraxial anesthesia.  
  
**What is Reduced Latency?  
**Reduced Latency is a term you will often see in anesthesia texts concerning onset times and adjuvants in neuraxial anesthesia.Reduced latency is a fancy way of saying “reducing the speed on onset” (make it work faster).  
  
**Neuraxial adjuvants include:  
Opioids** \- popular (PF Morphine, Fentanyl and Sufenta).  
**Sodium Bicarbonate** (NaHCO3) - not popular, but very well documented.  
**Vasoconstrictors** \- Epinephrine.  
**Alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists** \- rarely given, but slowly gaining popularity  
**Cholinergic agonists** \- not anymore - too much nausea.  
**N-methyl-d-aspartate** (NMDA) antagonists - N/A here.  
**γ-aminobutyric acid** (GABA) receptor agonists - N/A here.
