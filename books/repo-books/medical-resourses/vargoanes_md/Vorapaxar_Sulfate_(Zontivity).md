Vorapaxar Sulfate (Zontivity)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Vorapaxar Sulfate (Zontivity)

A Reversible Platelet-aggregation inhibitor; protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) antagonist.  
(but its long half-life makes it effectively irreversible).  
  
**Indications:  
**First-in-Class PAR-1 Antagonist, for the Reduction of Thrombotic Cardiovascular Events in Patients with a history of heart attack or with peripheral arterial disease.  
  
Reduction of the risk of thrombotic cardiovascular events (e.g., cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, urgent coronary revascularization) in patients with a history of MI or with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).  
**  
Used in conjunction with aspirin and/or clopidogrel**  
Data lacking of long half-life makes it effectively irreversible in use of vorapaxar in combination with other antiplatelet agents (e.g., prasugrel, ticagrelor) or as monotherapy.  
  
**Monitoring: Platelet function Assay  
**No specific monitoring has been determined for toxicity.  
  
**Mechanism of Action:  
**Vorapaxar inhibits thrombin-induced and thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRAP)-induced platelet aggregation in in vitro studies. Vorapaxar does not inhibit platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP), collagen or a thromboxane mimetic and does not affect coagulation parameters ex vivo. PAR-1 receptors are also expressed in a wide variety of cell types, including endothelial cells, neurons, and smooth muscle cells, but the pharmacodynamic effects of vorapaxar in these cell types have not been assessed.  
  
**PAR 1 Receptors**  
PAR-1 receptors are also expressed in a wide variety of cell types, including endothelial cells, neurons, and smooth muscle cells, but the pharmacodynamic effects of vorapaxar in these cell types have not been assessed.  
  
**Lab monitoring:** Due to reliability, not routinely monitored.  
Platelet function Assay is most reliable.  
Does NOT affect standard coagulation tests:  
PT, aPTT  
Thrombin Time \[TT\].  
Activated Clotting Time \[ACT\].  
Ecarin Clotting Time \[ECT\]).  
  
In healthy volunteer studies, no changes in platelet P-selectin and soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) expression or coagulation test parameters (TT, PT, aPTT, ACT, ECT) occurred after single- or multiple- dose (28 days) administration of vorapaxar.  
  
**Onset**  
At recommended doses, ZONTIVITY achieves ≥80% inhibition of TRAP-induced platelet aggregation within one week of initiation of treatment.  
  
**Absorption**  
After oral administration of a single ZONTIVITY 2.08 mg dose under fasted conditions, peak concentrations (Cmax) occurs at 1 hour post-dose (range: 1 to 2 h). The mean absolute bioavailability as determined from a microdosing study is approximately 100%.  
  
**Duration - (4 weeks)  
**The duration of platelet inhibition is dose- and concentration-dependent.  
Inhibition of TRAP-induced platelet aggregation at a level of 50% can be expected at 4 weeks after discontinuation of daily doses of ZONTIVITY 2.08 mg, consistent with the terminal elimination half-life of Vorapaxar.  
  
**Hepatic Impairment**  
No dosage adjustment necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment; use not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  
  
**Renal Impairment  
**No dosage adjustment necessary in patients with renal impairment, including those with end-stage renal disease.  
  
**Bioavailability**  
Rapidly absorbed after oral administration; peak plasma concentrations occur within approximately 60 minutes (range 1–2 hours).  
  
**Duration**  
Dose- and concentration-dependent; following discontinuance of recommended dosage, platelet-inhibitory effects expected to persist at a level of 50% inhibition for about 4 weeks.  
  
**Plasma Protein Binding**  
Both drug and active M20 metabolite extensively (>99%) bound to human plasma proteins.  
  
**Elimination Route**  
Eliminated principally by hepatobiliary excretion; following administration of radiolabeled drug, approximately 84% of dose was recovered (58% in feces and 25% in urine).  
  
**Half-life**  
Effective half-life 3–4 days; apparent terminal half-life of drug and active metabolite approximately 8 days (range 5–13 days).  
  
**Metabolism**  
Extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2J2.  
The major circulating active metabolite (M20) is pharmacologically and accounts for approximately 20% of total drug exposure.  
  
**Excretion:** 60% stool, 25% urine (total of 85% of labeled material in 6 weeks).

**Antidote: None  
**Use of platelet transfusion might help to reverse the antiplatelet effect of Vorapaxar post T1/2, but there has been no clinical experience with this technique. The sponsor suggests treatment of “signs and symptoms” in the event of overdose.  
**For overdose:** neither dialysis or platelet transfusion will help.
