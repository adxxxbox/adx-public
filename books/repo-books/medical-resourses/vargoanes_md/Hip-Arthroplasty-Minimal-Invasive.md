### Hip Arthroplasty -Minimally Invasive (Total)

**Minimal Invasive Total Hip Arthroplasty (MIS-THA)**  
  
For a traditional hip replacement, the incision is 5 to 10-inches.  
With the minimally-invasive (MIS) approach, incisions are about 1.5-2 two inches in length, though this can vary with the size of the patient.

The MIS technique involves generally avoiding or separating muscles, ligaments and tendons rather than cutting through them, as is done in traditional hip replacement surgery. This involves less muscle and tissue trauma, less post op pain and a quicker recovery. Less DVTs and less blood loss are plus factors for this case. However, MIS has a higher rate of infection and nerve palsy.  

  
MIS can use one or two incision approach. Incisions can be anterior or posterior; both have their advantages. See “More Notes” below.  
  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
**Regional:** Spinal or Epidural  
Remember: a spinal means less EBL. Many patients receive both a spinal and an ETT, or a spinal with a NC and Propofol infusion. They are in the lateral position so you will need a good airway if you want to use a NC.  
**Duration:** 1-3 hours  
**Position:** Lateral or Supine, usually lateral.  
**EBL:** 200-900mLs. Varies with surgeons.  
**Cell Saver:** Sometimes  
**Duration:** 1.5 -3 hours  
**IV Access:** 1-2 18G  
**Neo Drip:** usually  
**Blood Type and Screened:** Yes  
**Administer Tranexamic Acid:** usually 20mg/kg after induction to decrease blood loss.  
**Foley Catheter:** Yes  
**A-Line:** Usually not, but many still do.  
The components inserted are usually cementless.  
 

**Complications:**  
DVTs  
Excessive blood loss.  
Intraoperative femoral shaft fracture.   
Complications related to cement Methyl-methacrylate.  
Anterior approach is subject to occasional Lateral Femoral Cutaneous nerve damage.  
  
**More Notes**  
There are two approaches, anterior or posterior.  
**Anterior:**   
Supine position  
The surgeon works through the natural space between the muscles. The most important muscles for hip function are left undisturbed and do not require a healing process to recover from surgical trauma. To visualize the joint, the surgeon retracts between the  Tensor and Sartorius muscles. This provides excellent visualization of the acetabulum but poor exposure of the femur.  
This procedure carries a higher risk of nerve damage to the Lateral Femoral Cutaneous nerve and intraoperative femur fracture. There may be a temporary sciatic nerve injury due to vigorous operative retraction.

**Posterior**  
Lateral position  
Better exposure requiring less retraction.  
There is almost a zero risk for nerve damage.
