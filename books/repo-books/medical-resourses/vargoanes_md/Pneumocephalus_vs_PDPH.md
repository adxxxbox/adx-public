Pneumocephalus vs PDPH    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Pneumocephalus (Iatrogenic) versus Post Dural Puncture Headache (PDPH)

_Like a PDPH, a pneumocephalus ALSO results in a headache after a dura puncture, so it may also be considered a PDPH. The etiology, onset and treatment between the two are different._**  
  
The main differences between a Pneumocephalus and PDPH is:**  
Onset/Duration  
Cause  
Treatment  
  
With a **Pneumocephalus** the symptoms are typically very similar to a PDPH. However, the primary difference is a quick onset, particularly if the patient is sitting up as this allows the air to rise quickly into the ventricles. With a spinal headache due to a CSF leak, the onset is usually 24-48 hours later, requiring time for the CSF to leak and the brain to drop in the cranial vault.  
If untreated, a PDPH will usually resolve in a week.**A pneumocephalus is one of the 2 causes of a PDPH** .  
You must be able to differentiate a pneumocephalus from a standard PDPH by knowing the cause (etiology) in order to successfully treat it.  
  
**The PDPH we commonly refer to:** A nasty headache from a wet tap resulting from an inadvertent dura puncture. The dura puncture leads to the loss of CSF from the subarachnoid space.  
  
**Pneumocephalus:** A nasty headache from the injection of air into the subarachnoid space resulting from an inadvertent dura puncture. Some literature also states it may occur from air injected into the epidural space.  
  
**Onset/Duration of Pneumocephalus:** immediate to a few hours and usually disappears in 3–5 days with the reabsorption of the air. **Onset/Duration of PDPH (from CSF leakage)** from a few hours or 7-12 days after deliveryMost PDPH occurs with 24-48 hours after delivery. **Pneumocephalus Treatment:** 100% oxygen  
**PDPH from a CSF Leak:** Blood patch is common
