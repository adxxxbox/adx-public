Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Basic Notes   

### Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Basic Notes

MRI is a medical imaging technique used in radiology to investigate the anatomy and physiology of the body in both health and disease.

MRI scanners use magnetic fields and radio waves to form images of the body.

MRIs are very popular for medical diagnosing, staging of disease and for follow-ups because there is no exposure to ionizing radiation and their high degree of detail.  
Because there is exposure to ionizing radiation, MRI is generally favored over CT.

MRI is rapidly growing in importance as a way of diagnosing and monitoring congenital defects of the fetus as it can provide more diagnostic information than ultrasound and it lacks the ionizing radiation of CT.

MRI without contrast agents is the imaging mode of choice for presurgical in-utero diagnosis, as well as fetal evaluation of tumors; primarily teratomas. Thus facilitating open fetal surgery, other fetal interventions, and planning for procedures to safely deliver and treat babies whose defects would otherwise be fatal.

However, in certain cases MRI is not preferred as it can be more expensive, time-consuming, and claustrophobia-exacerbating.  
  
**MRI is used for:**  
Neuroimaging  
Cardiovascular  
Musculoskeletal  
Liver and gastrointestinal  
Oncology  

MRI requires a magnetic field that is both strong and uniform. The field strength of the magnet is measured in teslas – and while the majority of systems operate at 1.5T, commercial systems are available between 0.2T–7T. Basically, the higher the tesla the stronger the magnet and the faster the scan.

**MRI Safety: Most important**  
All patients scheduled for MRI’s should have their medical history evaluated for any possible contraindications to MRI scanning.  
  
Patient medical devices and implants can be placed into one of three categories:  
**MR-safe**  
**MR-conditional**  
**MR-unsafe**  
**MR-safe:** the device or implant is completely non-magnetic, non-electrically conductive, and non-RF reactive, eliminating all of the primary potential threats during an MRI procedure.  
**MR-conditional:** A device or implant that may contain magnetic, electrically conductive or RF-reactive components that are safe for operations in proximity to the  
MRI, provided the conditions for safe operation are defined and observed.  
**MR-unsafe:** Objects that are significantly ferromagnetic and pose a clear and direct threat to persons and equipment within the magnetic room.  
  
MRI unsafe objects include, but are not limited to, devices such as cochlear implants, and most pacemakers. However, many implants can be safely scanned if the appropriate guidelines regarding these devices are followed. A list of appropriate conditions for implants can be found at www.MRIsafety.com.

Titanium objects and like alloys are safe from attraction within the MR suite.

**Ferromagnetic foreign bodies such as:** (shell fragments or metallic implants) and other items are MR unsafe. Foreign bodies can interact with the magnetic and radio frequency field and become heated or torqued during the MRI procedure. Other metallic items can become projectiles within the MR suite causing injury to the patient and damage to the imaging matching.  
Titanium objects and like alloys are safe from attraction with in the MR suite.

**Objects to keep out of the MRI Suite:**  
• Purse, wallet, money clip, credit cards, cards with magnetic strips  
• Electronic devices such as beepers or cell phones  
• Hearing aids  
• Metal jewelry, watches  
• Pens, paper clips, keys, coins  
• Hair barrettes, hairpins  
• Any article of clothing that has a metal zipper, buttons, snaps, hooks, underwire, or metallic threads  
• Shoes, belt buckles, safety pins  
  
**Objects that may interfere with image quality if close to the area being scanned include:**  
• Metallic spinal rod  
• Plates, pins, screws, or metal mesh used to repair a bone or joint  
• Joint replacement or prosthesis  
• Metallic jewelry including those used for body piercing  
• Some tattoos or tattooed eyeliner (these alter MR images, and there is a chance of skin irritation or swelling; black and blue pigments are the most troublesome)  
• Makeup, nail polish or other cosmetic that contains metal  
• Bullet, shrapnel, or other type of metal fragment  
• Metallic foreign body within or near the eye (such an object generally can be seen on an x-ray; metal workers are most likely to have this problem)  
Dental fillings (while usually unaffected by the magnetic field, they may distort images of the facial area or brain; the same is true for orthodontic braces and retainers)

**Contrast:**  
Gadolinium contrast medium makes certain tissues, abnormalities or disease processes more clearly visible on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Gadolinium based contrast medium is sometimes called an MRI contrast medium or agent  
  
Gadolinium contrast medium is used in up to 30% of MRI scans to improve the clarity of the scanned images or pictures of your body’s internal structures. This improves the diagnostic accuracy of the MRI scan. For example, it increases the visibility of inflammation, a tumor or growth, blood vessels, cardiac (heart) muscle scarring and assesses the blood flow to organs such as the brain and heart.

**Allergic Reactions to Gadolinium**  
Patients have a very small allergic risk to Gadolinium contrast medium.  
Minor reactions (such as hives or itchy eyes) can occur in approximately 1 in 1,000 people.  
More significant reactions (difficulty in breathing or collapse) might occur in 1 in 10,000 people.

**Poor kidney function with Gadolinium  
**Patients with poor kidney function should avoid Gadalinium.Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is a rare, but serious complication following a gadolinium chelate injection in people with very poor kidney function.

**Pregnancy:**  
No effects of MRI on the fetus have been demonstrated.  
Current guidelines recommend that pregnant women undergo MRI only when essential. **MRI and CT of the Cardiovascular System** Hardcover – August 12, 2013
