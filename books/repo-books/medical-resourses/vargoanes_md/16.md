### Cardioplegia Cannulation

This will occur during a period of increased workload.  
  
The surgeon will next be inserting some other small cannulae for the cardioplegia to eventually arrest the heart.  
  
Once these are in place, cardiopulmonary bypass will be initiated.  
  
The cardioplegia solution will not be delivered to arrest the heart until the aorta is cross clamped.
