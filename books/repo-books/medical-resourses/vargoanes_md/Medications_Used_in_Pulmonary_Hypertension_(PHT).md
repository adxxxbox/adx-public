Pulmonary Hypertensive Crisis and Treatments    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Pulmonary Hypertensive Crisis and Treatments

_No single pulmonary vasodilator appears to be superior to others in ALL respects.  
All pulmonary vasodilators have limitations due to a variety of contraindications and adverse effects. Some are life-threatening._  
**Intravenous pulmonary vasodilators have** the disadvantage of systemic vasodilatation leading to hypotension, necessitating the concomitant use of vasopressors with their inherent drawbacks.

**A: Oxygen  
**Oxygen is a recommended core component of conventional therapy for patients with PAH and COPD because it can slow or even reverse the progression of the process.  
  
Hypoxemia causes vasoconstriction of the pulmonary vasculature by hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). HPV is intrinsic to the lung and is modulated by the endothelial and smooth-muscle cells, but the exact mechanism of this effect is unknown.  
  
Many people with advanced pulmonary hypertension eventually require continuous oxygen therapy.  
  
**B: Calcium channel blockers (CCBs)** (diltiazem, nifedipine or amlodipine)  
**Diltiazem** 120 mg/day or  
**Nifedipine** 30mg/day or  
**Amlodipine:** a long-acting dihydropyridine. May be administered when patients do not respond to diltiazem or nifedipine.  
  
CCBs inhibit the influx of calcium ions into smooth-muscle cells and thus cause relaxation and vasodilation.  
CCBs are a first-line treatment for patients with mild functional impairment from PAH.  
Long-term use of CCBs (diltiazem and nifedipine) reduced PAP, decreased right-ventricular hypertrophy, and improved survival over a 5-year period, with improvement in symptoms.  
CCBs are NOT prescribed for group 1 PAH patients unless their acute vasoreactivity test is positive.  
Unfortunately, of those patients who are vasoreactive, only half will display long-term improvement with CCB treatment.  
CCB therapy may be initiated with either long acting nifedipine or diltiazem, then titrated to the maximal tolerated dose.  
  
**Negative vasoreactive patients are NOT candidates for CCBs**  
Adverse effects from CCBs are common among patients with PAH who were previously tested and NOT vasoreactive.  
CCB adverse effects include systemic vasodilation causing hypotension, while pulmonary vasodilation may reduce hypoxic vasoconstriction. Loss of hypoxic vasoconstriction can worsen ventilation-perfusion mismatch and hypoxemia. CCBs may also be associated with deterioration of right ventricular (RV) function.  
  
**C: Inhaled Nitric Oxide (INO)**  
When delivered through the inspiratory limb of the ventilator circuit, INO gas diffuses rapidly across the alveolar-capillary membrane into the vascular smooth muscle and mediates relaxation. The vasodilator effect of INO can decrease PAP and reduce right-ventricular afterload.  
Improvement in ventilation/perfusion matching and oxygenation occurs in approximately 60% of patients who receive supplemental INO.  
Once in the bloodstream, NO is metabolized within seconds and its duration of effect is only a few minutes.  
INO therapy has several potential toxicities and toxic metabolites. NO is unstable in the presence of oxygen; it undergoes spontaneous oxidation to nitrogen dioxide (N20), which is toxic when inhaled.  
  
**Review of nitric oxide (NO)**  
NO is naturally synthesized within cells by an enzyme NO synthase (NOS).  
NOS catalyzes the oxidation of L-arginine to L-citrulline, producing NO, which diffuses into vascular smooth muscle.  
It then activates guanylate cyclase which in turn converts guanosine triphosphate into cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). This leads to a decrease in intracellular calcium and produces relaxation and vasodilation.  
  
In the US, INO is delivered in a 0.8% concentration with nitrogen (99.2%).  
**INO doses are in parts per million (ppm)  
**Dosage of INO is usually 20 ppm, however ranges from 5-80 ppm.  
It may be administered for up to 14 days, or until the underlying desaturation is resolved.  
Dosages of greater than 20 ppm lead to toxicity.  
  
**INO set up  
**Respiratory therapy with bring the INO machine into the operating room when you need it. They will set the desired ppm dose ordered to begin therapy.  
The device will be connected within the inspiratory limb on the anesthesia ventilator circuit.  
You will need to run the fresh gas flows at 8 liters per minute.  
Due to the risk of toxicity to others, INO requires a scavenger system.  
  
**D: Nitric oxide donor drugs (** **nitroprusside and nitroglycerin)**  
Nitric oxide (NO) donors are pharmacologically active substances that release NO.  
Sodium nitroprusside and nitroglycerin decrease pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP).  
**  
Sodium nitroprusside**  
Low-dose intravenous sodium nitroprusside causes pulmonary vasodilation and reduces PAP, PVR, and right-ventricular afterload, but its effect is not selective.  
It is no longer commonly used due to toxicity risks and the availability of newer alternative drugs.  
Not all practices make sodium nitroprusside available.  
  
**Nitroglycerin:** Very effective, but not selective. It causes systemic vasodilatation leading to hypotension, necessitating the concomitant use of a vasopressor.  
Milrinone is more commonly used than Nitroglycerin for PHT.  
**E: Prostacyclin (prostaglandin) pathway agonist**  
  
IV Epoprostenol  
A relative deficiency of endogenous prostacyclin may be a contributing factor to the pathogenesis of some forms of PAH.  
**Synthetic analogs of prostacyclin**  
  
**Treprostinil:** given by subcutaneous, intravenous, or inhalation route.  
**Iloprost:** Inhaled  
_Prostaglandin I-2 and_ _prostaglandin E-1 are produced as metabolites of arachidonic acid in the vascular smooth-muscle cells._  
_Prostacyclins stimulate soluble adenylate cyclase and convert adenosine triphosphate to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This causes a cAMP-induced decrease in intracellular calcium and produces relaxation and vasodilation_  
  
Use of prostacyclins in WHO Group 2 PH is not well studied.  
The use of prostacyclins in WHO Group 3 PH is controversial.  
  
**Review of prostacyclins (prostaglandin) I-2 and E-1  
**E-1 is a potent vasodilator with antiplatelet and antiproliferative effects that increases intracellular cAMP.  
Prostaglandin I-2 and prostaglandin E-1 are both potent pulmonary vasodilators.  
**Prostaglandin I2:** Commonly abbreviated as PGI2 or PGI 2 .  
**Prostaglandin E1:** Commonly abbreviated as PGE1 or PGE 1 .  
  
**Iloprost (** **Ventavis®)** prostacyclin analog  
  
**Inhalation** or intravenous administrationThe first prostaglandin I-2 approved by the FDA for the treatment of PAH via direct pulmonary delivery by aerosol inhalation.  
Iloprost is a synthetic prostacyclin analog solution for inhalation.  
**Indications:** For the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group 1) to improve exercise tolerance and symptoms (NYHA Class), and to prevent deterioration. Patients studied were those with NYHA Functional Class III-IV symptoms and etiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH (65%), or PAH associated with connective tissue disease (23%).  
Disadvantage: Iloprost has a half-life of only 20 - 30 min; it requires 6 - 9 inhalation sessions per day using a special inhalation system.  
  
**Inhalation Doses:  
Initial dose:** 2.5 mcg (10 mcg/mL)  
(2.5 to 5 mcg, six to nine times per day)  
  
If well tolerated, increase to 5 mcg (10 mcg/mL) and maintain; otherwise, reduce to 2.5 mcg.  
  
Given the presence of multiple treatment options currently available, iloprost inhalation as a single primary therapy may have a limited role in the treatment of chronic PAH.  
  
**Treprostinil (Remodulin®)** A prostacyclin analog that can be administered by subcutaneous or intravenous administration.  
Treprostinil is preferably infused subcutaneously but can be administered by a central intravenous line if the subcutaneous route is not tolerated because of severe site pain or reaction.  
  
**Indications:** In adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; WHO Group 1,2), to diminish symptoms associated with exercise.  
Recently approved for patients with group 1 PAH who are WHO functional class III.  
Patients receiving epoprostenol may be transitioned to subcutaneous or intravenous treprostinil.  
Treprostinil was studied mainly in patients with NYHA Functional Class II-IV symptoms.  
Treprostinil has the advantage of stability.  
It can be administered subcutaneously, by IV infusion, and by inhalation.  
Has a longer half-life of 4 hours.  
Treprostinil has similar safety concerns to those of epoprostenol.  
  
The inhaled formulation is administered in four inhalation sessions per day and requires the use of a specially-designed inhalation system.  
**Dose:** The infusion rate is initiated at 1.25 ng/kg/min. If this initial dose cannot be tolerated because of systemic effects, the infusion rate should be reduced to 0.625 ng/kg/min.  
  
**Adjustments:** The infusion rate should be increased in increments of 1.25 ng/kg/min per week for the first four weeks of treatment and then 2.5 ng/kg/min per week for the remaining duration of infusion, depending on clinical response.  
  
**Advantages of parenteral treprostinil over epoprostenol**  
May continuously be administered subcutaneously.  
Has a longer half-life, thus a short interruption of infusion won’t cause a deadly rebound.  
Does not require refrigeration.  
  
If treprostinil is ineffective, epoprostenol may be used.  
**Epoprostenol (** **prostacyclin; PGI** **2** **)  
**_Also referred to as Flolan or Veltri_  
Epoprostenol directly vasodilates the pulmonary and systemic arterial vasculature, which reduces ventricular afterload, pulmonary vascular resistance and platelet aggregation, and thus increases cardiac output (CO).  
Inhaled epoprostenol is an effective alternative to INO in the acute care setting.  
  
**WHO Group I PAH patients**  
Epoprostenol pulmonary vasodilation is an advanced therapy that improves hemodynamic parameters, functional capacity, and survival in patients with group I idiopathic PAH (IPAH) patients.  
For other types of group I PAH patients, epoprostenol improves hemodynamic parameters and functional capacity. The drug is too new for reliable documented survival rates.  
  
**Severe PHT symptoms (WHO functional class IV)**  
_Because clinical trials are lacking, epoprostenol should be considered the first-line agent in severe disease._  
**Route:** Inhalation or intravenous (IV) administration  
**Intravenous indications:****  
For long-term treatment of adult patients with NYHA functional Class III or IV primary pulmonary hypertension (Group I) or adults with pulmonary hypertension due to scleroderma (systemic sclerosis).  
****IV Delivery:** Administered through a permanently implanted central venous catheter using a portable infusion pump  
  
**Inhalation (aerosolized) Indication:** **For short-term treatment of pulmonary hypertension.**  
  
**Aerosolized epoprostenol has been effective in treating:**  
Primary and secondary PAH  
Cardiac surgery-associated PAH and right ventricular failure  
Lung transplantation-related reperfusion injury  
Porto-pulmonary hypertension following liver transplantation  
Hypoxemia due to single-lung ventilation  
  
Various delivery systems are available for epoprostenol administration. Due to the short half-life of the drug, pneumatic and ultrasonic means provide for continuous use.  
  
**Disadvantage of IV Epoprostenol  
**_Because of the short half-life (2–6 minutes), interruptions in epoprostenol therapy related to catheter displacement or pump malfunction may be life- threatening due to acute rebound PAH._  
In ICUs, it is common to have a back-up pump with epoprostenol ready to immediately replace the primary source in the event of pump failure or any other interruption.  
Interruption of therapy will proceed to severe deterioration.  
**Doses of** **epoprostenol**  
  
**Intravenous and inhalation starting doses:** vary depending on patient setting and characteristics, but is typically initiated as noted below”  
  
**Intravenous:** At 1 to 2 ng/kg/min, increased by 1 to 2 ng/kg/min every one to two days as tolerated. Once 6 to 10 ng/kg/min is achieved, most patients require dose increases of 1 to 2 ng/kg/min every two to four weeks to sustain the clinical effect.  
  
Patients receiving epoprostenol for many years may receive doses as high as 150 to 200 ng/kg/min with sustained clinical and hemodynamic benefit.  
  
When doses produce high output cardiac states, administration rate should be reduced, monitoring for rebound pulmonary hypertension.  
  
**Maximum Dose:** Has not been established  
**Inhalation dosage range:** Continuously inhaled at 10–50 ng/kg/min.  
During anesthesia, administration usually begins at 50 ng/kg/min, titrated to effect.  
  
**F: Non-prostanoid prostacyclin receptor agonists  
****Selexipag (Uptravi®)**  
  
**Indication:** PAH, WHO Group I, functional classification II or III symptoms.  
An oral selective non-prostanoid prostacyclin receptor (IP receptor) agonist  
  
Both selexipag and its active metabolite possess high selectivity for the IP receptor over other prostanoid receptors distinguishing it from prostacyclin and prostacyclin analogs currently used in the management of PAH  
**Dose:** 200 to 1600 micrograms  
  
**G: Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors  
sildenafil (Viagra** **®, Revatio** **®), tadalafil (Cialis** **®** )  
  
**PDE5 inhibitors:** Sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil are orally administered cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors that prolong the vasodilatory effect of nitric oxide and are also used to treat erectile dysfunction.  
  
**Sildenafil (Viagra)** improves pulmonary hemodynamics and exercise capacity in patients with group 1 PAH  
PDE5 is an enzyme abundantly expressed in the lungs that hydrolyzes cGMP, a second messenger of the NO pathway within the lungs. PDE5 inhibitors prevent the hydrolysis of cGMP, which has vasodilatory and antiproliferative effects on the pulmonary vasculature.  
  
The two PDE5 inhibitors FDA-approved for treatment of PAH in the USA are sildenafil and tadalafil.  
Compared with prostacyclin analogs and endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs), PDE5 inhibitors tend to be well tolerated.  
  
Sildenafil improves mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), cardiac index (CI), and exercise tolerance in pulmonary arterial hypertension.  
  
**Indications:** Pulmonary hypertension, usually WHO Functional Class II-III.  
  
**Half-life:** 4 hours, requiring dosing three times daily.  
  
**Initial dose:** 5 or 20 mg orally three times a day, 4 to 6 hours apart  
**Maximum dose:** 20 mg orally three times a day  
**Injection** : Initial dose: 2.5 or 10 mg IV bolus three times a day  
  
Present therapeutic applications have limitations including the delivery mechanism (e.g., IV epoprostenol), short half-life (e.g., inhaled iloprost), and cost  
  
Due to the concern regarding severe hypotension, PDE5 inhibitors should not be used with nitrates. More serious, but rare adverse effects include retinal vascular disease, myocardial infarction and nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy.  
  
**Tadalafil (Cialis®)  
**Also improves outcomes in patients with group 1 PAH.  
Tadalafil (40 mg) has significantly increased the six-minute walk distance and the time to clinical worsening, while decreasing the incidence of clinical worsening and improving health related quality of life.

**Endothelin receptor antagonists** **(ERAs)  
**Bosentan (Tracleer **®** )  
Macitentan (Opsumit **®** )  
Ambrisentan (Letairis **®** )  
Also improves outcomes in patients with group 1 PAH.  
  
The most potent vasoconstrictor in man is endothelin-1 (ET-1).  
  
It is produced in the endothelium and binds primarily to one of two G-protein coupled receptors, ET A and ET B of the vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells.  
ET A receptor is responsible for pulmonary vasoconstriction.  
ET B receptor produces pulmonary vasodilation through the release of NO and prostacyclin.  
  
High concentrations of ET-1 have been recorded in the lungs of patients with both idiopathic PAH and other etiologies of group 1 PAH, including scleroderma and congenital cardiac shunt lesions  
  
As with other PAH-targeted therapies, research is limited on the use of ERAs for PHT in WHO Groups 2–5.  
Studies on WHO Group 2 PHT have been limited, partly because the current literature indicates that ERAs are not beneficial in heart failure patients, making them weak candidates for the treatment of WHO Group 2 PHT.  
ERAs are contraindicated during pregnancy.  
  
**Adverse effects of ERAs  
**Hepatotoxicity and peripheral edema.  
ERAs are potent teratogens, requiring meticulous, double method contraception if used by women with PHT.  
  
**There are two receptors (endothelin receptor A and B) that are targeted by endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs).**  
Nonselective dual action receptor antagonists include bosentan and macitentan.  
  
**Bosentan,** the first ERA approved in the USA, is a dual ET A /ET B receptor antagonist with slightly higher affinity for the ET A receptor.  
**Terminal half-life:** 5 hours, dosed orally twice daily.  
Effective in severe group 1 PAH (WHO functional class III or IV) and may also be effective in patients with moderate group 1 PAH (WHO functional class II)  
  
**Macitentan (Opsumit®)**  
  
An oral dual ET A /ET B receptor antagonist.  
Has a 50-fold increased selectivity for the ET A subtype compared to the ET B subtype.  
  
A steady state of effect is reached by the third day of administration.  
**Half-life:** 16 hours  
  
**Dose:** 10 mg daily.**Indications:** WHO group 1 PAH.  
  
**Ambrisentan (Letairis®)  
**An oral selective type A endothelin-1 receptor antagonist.  
Is the least hepatotoxic of the ERAs.  
  
Has a > 4000-fold increased selectivity for the ET A versus ET B receptor type.  
Dose: Q day  
  
**Effective half-life:** 9 hours  
Often prescribed with PDE5 inhibitor tadalafil (Cialis **®** ).  
**Adult dosage:** 5-10 mg once daily, with or without tadalafil.  
  
**Indication:** Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) WHO Group 1patients to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening.  
  
A combination of Letaris and tadalafil has reduced the risk of disease progression.  
  
**H: Soluble guanylate cyclase (SGC) stimulator** (a fairly new class)  
  
Riociguat (Adempas **®** )  
  
**Guanylate cyclase stimulant** — Stimulators of the nitric oxide receptor.  
**Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) have a dual mode of action** :  
Increase the sensitivity of sGC to endogenous nitric oxide (NO)  
Directly stimulate the receptor to mimic the action of NO.  
  
Nitric oxide (NO) appear to be mediated through the sGC-cGMP-dependent downstream mechanisms, whereas most of its detrimental effects occur independently.  
  
**Indications:** Persistent/recurrent chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) (WHO group 4) after surgical treatment or inoperable CTEPH to improve exercise capacity and WHO functional class.  
As monotherapy or in combination with endothelin receptor antagonists or prostanoids to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO group 1) to improve exercise capacity, improve WHO functional class and to delay clinical worsening.  
  
**Initial dose:** 1 mg orally 3 times a day  
**Maximum dose:** 2.5 mg orally 3 times a day  
  
Contraindicated with pregnancy.  
  
**I: Diuretics  
**Patients with fluid retention from PHT-related right ventricular (RV) failure may benefit from diuretics.  
Diuretics decrease hepatic congestion, peripheral edema, and pleural effusions.  
They may also be beneficial for whose interventricular septum encroaches into the left ventricle as a result of elevated RV pressures.
