### Decompressive Craniectomy

This procedure is performed as a life saving measure.  
A procedure in which part of the skull is removed to permit an actively swelling brain room to expand when other ICP controlling treatments have failed.  
Sometimes the surgeon just needs to evacuate an underlying clot, that is compressing the brain.

The goal is to permit the actively swelling brain to expand outward rather than inward, thus preventing brainstem compression and possible brain death.  
Most of these patients are Neuro ICU patients who are intubated, have an A-line, and acceptable IV access. Lucky for us, these patients are not usually actively bleeding like you would see with a hemorrhaging cerebral aneurysm. We rarely need to administer blood.

For anesthesia, this is a quick procedure. You prepare the OR room like an emergency craniotomy and have all your brain protection meds available.

_Patients with acute changes are more likely to be sensitive to the anesthetic effects on ICP._

The anesthesia you provide is basic craniotomy. Once the surgeon removes a piece of the skull (craniectomy), the ICP will drop as the brain is permitted to expand through the given space. The surgeon will usually warn you to be prepared for a possible drop in BP.

Have some have neosynephrine and ephedrine available. The patient is to remain intubated and transferred back to the neuro ICU.

Over time the brain swelling should subside and the bone that was removed can be replaced via cranioplasty. Typically the bone is stored in a freezer.

In the meantime, some patients are provided with a custom fit helmet that they wear to from further brain injury.

**Pre-op**  
Remember, these patients are usually deteriorating from an uncontrolled elevated ICP and may already have brain damage.

**Find out as much as you can from the surgeon and call the neuro ICU for specifics.**

Have anesthesia IV tubing primed and ready to connect to an available port. When the patient arrives to the OR area, get a quick report and baseline neurological status (DOCUMENT BASELINE).  
Don’t forget to have an extra syringe of propofol if Mayfield pins will be used.

Find out how the patient will be positioned.

**MRI results:** Is there brain edema, a midline shift > than 0.5 cm and ventricular size changes?  
**Labs:**  
Check electrolytes: these patients are prone to electrolyte abnormalities secondary to loop diuretics.  
**Meds To consider:**  
**Steroids:** These patients are usually on them. Patients on chronic steroids may be hypo-adrenal, so be alert for refractory hypotension.  
**Mannitol and Lasix:** Always have available. The patient may already have received them in the unit.  
**Anticonvulsants:** Is the patient on any?  
If yes, check anticonvulsant levels along with your CBC and Electrolytes.  
**Pre medication:** Patient should already be intubated and sedated upon arrival  
**  
Possible Drips:**  
Nipride or Nitroglycerine: Titrate to effect  
Neosynephrine: Titrate to effect  
Propofol: 50-100mcg/kg/min.  
Remifentanil: 0.02-0.2mcg/kg/min.  
Sufenta: Some prefer Sufenta over Remifentanil.  
Transient hypotension should generally be treated with incremental doses of Ephedrine or Neosynephrine rather than IV Fluids. We usually just titrate the Neosynephrine.  
**Foley catheter:** Usually has one

**Basic CSF Drainage System:** Some of these patients will have one. The surgeon will usually give post op instructions concerning when to open the system.

**Room Set up**  
Most of the time, these patients are already intubated and on the ventilator. The patient is usually delivered to you on a big ICU bed somewhere in the OR hallway with a nurse, RRT and a helper. The patient will be manually ventilated (bagged) by the RRT. Get your report and vent settings. Many times the patient will be on a Propofol drip.  
Bring some Versed and a 10cc syringe of flush so you can give Versed before you take the patient to surgery and turn off the Propofol. Sometimes we just let the Propofol drip continue and use less inhalation agent if the BP permits.

Make sure you check the patient’s pupils pre and post op.

If you are in a facility that you have to go to the unit and get the patient, make sure you bring:  
Primed IV anesthesia tubing  
Versed and flush  
Transport Monitor  
Transport Tech to help  
Oxygen E cylinder (unless the ICU offers one)

**Surgical Procedure**  
The neurosurgeons will make an incision in the scalp, typically on the side of the head where the most compression is taking place (especially in cases where the compression is caused by a blood clot).  
Once the skin and underlying tissues have been cut and moved out of the way, a piece of a skull is then removed. The bone is stored in a freezer in hoping the brain swelling has subsided and the bone may eventually be put back in place. While the bone is removed, patients are provided with a custom fit helmet that they wear to prevent further brain injury.

**Possible Complications**  
Bleeding  
Infection and Meningitis

**Emergent**  
The patient will most likely remain intubated if arrived from the ICU intubated.
