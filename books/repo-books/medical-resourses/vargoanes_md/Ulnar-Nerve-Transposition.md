#### Ulnar Nerve- Transposition (For Cubital Tunnel Syndrome)

**Cubital Tunnel Syndrome** is a condition brought on by increased pressure on the ulnar nerve at the elbow. The most common sites of entrapment around the elbow are the olecranon groove and the cubital tunnel.

The ulnar nerve runs just posterior to the medial epicondyle in the cubital tunnel or ulnar groove. When pressure on the nerve becomes great enough to disturb the way the nerve works, then numbness, tingling, and pain may be felt in the elbow, forearm, hand, and/or fingers.

In this procedure, the surgeon may shift the nerve to the front of the elbow, which relieves pressure and tension on the nerve. The nerve may be placed under a layer of fat, under the muscle, or within the muscle. Some surgeons may recommend trimming the medial epicondyle.
