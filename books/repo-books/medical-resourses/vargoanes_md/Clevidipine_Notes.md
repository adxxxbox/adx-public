### Clevidipine (Cleviprex) Notes

For continuous infusion. Similar in appearance to propofol.  
  
Clevidipine is a new third-generation IV dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB) that was approved by the FDA in 2008 for treatment of severe hypertension.  
  
**Advantages**  
Fast onset and offset (ultra-short half-life of <1 minute).  
Ease of titration.  
Small volume of distribution.  
Fast elimination independent of hepatic and renal clearance.  
It is an arterial selective vasodilator that reduces peripheral vascular resistance directly without causing venous (capacitance vessel) dilation.  
BP reductions occur within 6 to 10 minutes. BP and heart rate return to baseline within 10 to 15 minutes after discontinuation of the drug.  
  
**Acute hypertension:** 1mg bolus may decrease BP within 90 seconds.  
**Class:** Calcium-channel blockers: dihydropyridine.  
**Solution concentration:** 0.5mg/mL.  
**Character:** Similar in appearance to propofol; milky white injectable emulsion.  
Contains 0.2 grams of lipids per mL.  
Because of lipid load restrictions, no more than 1000 mL or an average of 21 mg/hour of clevidipine infusion is recommended per 24-hour period.  
**Decreases SVR  
Mechanism of action:** Blockade of the dihydropyridine L-type calcium channels, found primarily on the arterial rather than venous system. Researchers noted no change in central venous pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, or cardiac index with increasing doses.  
  
**Half-life:** 1 minute  
  
**Indications:** Reduction of BP when oral therapy is not feasible or desirable.  
**Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment not necessary.  
**Hepatic Impairment:** Dose adjustment not necessary.  
**Elimination:** Rapid  
  
**Metabolism:** By the blood and tissue esterases independent of liver and kidney function.  
Has little to no risk of cytochrome P450-associated drug toxicity.  
Metabolized to inactive metabolites with a mean blood clearance rate of 0.121 l/min per kg.  
  
**Protein bound:** Up to 99.7%.  
  
**Heart rate increase:**  
Clevidipine does result in a modest increase in heart rate from baseline, as has been shown with other IV calcium channel blockers. Heart rate increases within the first 30 minutes of administration, but this appears to return to baseline.  
  
**Pregnancy Category:** C  
**C:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.  
Animal studies show risk and human studies not available or neither animal nor human studies done.  
  
**Lactation:** Not known if excreted into breast milk, do not nurse  
  
**Possible complications:  
**Hypotension and reflex tachycardia from rapid dose increases; decrease rapidity of increase in dose.  
Rebound hypertension when the drug is discontinued without transitioning to another antihypertension agent. It is therefore advised that patients be observed for 8 hours after the infusion is discontinued.  
  
**Adverse Effects**  
**\>10%  
**AFib (21%)  
Nausea (21%)  
  
**1-10%  
**Acute renal failure (9%)  
Headache (6%)  
Vomiting (3%)  
  
**<1%  
**Cardiac arrest  
Myocardial infarction  
  
**Postmarketing Reports:  
**Increased blood triglycerides.  
Ileus.  
Nausea.  
Hypersensitivity.  
Hypotension.  
Reflex tachycardia.  
Decreased oxygen saturation (possible pulmonary shunting).  
  
**Contraindications:  
**Hypersensitivity to drug, soy or egg products.  
Defective lipid metabolism.  
Acte pancreatitis if accompanied by hyperlipidemia.  
Severe aortic stenosis  
  
**Cautions:  
**CHF  
Risk of hypotension & reflex tachycardia.  
Contains no preservatives.  
Potential for rebound HTN after discontinuation of prolonged infusion.  
  
**More Notes:**  
It reduces BP without affecting cardiac filling pressures or causing reflex tachycardia.  
  
**Advantages**  
Fast onset and offset (ultra-short half-life of <1 minute).  
Ease of titration.  
Small volume of distribution.  
Fast elimination independent on hepatic and renal clearance.  
It is an arterial selective vasodilator that reduces peripheral vascular resistance directly without causing venous capacitance dilation.  
BP reductions occur within 6 to 10 minutes and BP and heart rate return to baseline within 10 to 15 minutes after discontinuation of the drug.  
  
**Acute hypertension:** 1mg bolus may decrease BP within 90 seconds.
