### Tourniquet Notes

Tourniquets are useful aids for limb procedures as they decrease the blood loss during surgery and provide a relatively bloodless field for the surgeon, if used properly!  
  
Muscle is more susceptible to ischemic damage than nerve with tourniquets.  
  
Histological evidence of muscle damage is evident 30–60 minutes after tourniquet inflation.  
  
Decreased pH (<6.5), decreased pO 2 , increased pCO 2 , increased K+, increased lactate, occur progressively. These changes are generally mild and well tolerated.  
  
Tourniquet pain develops in up to 66% of patients, 30–60 minutes after cuff inflation.  
Tourniquet-induced hypertension occurs in 11–66% of cases.

**The usual Orthopedic Fixed inflation pressures:** 

250 mm Hg for upper arm  
300 mm Hg for thigh

Or a fixed amount of pressure above systolic arterial pressure, typically +100 mm Hg for upper arm and 100–150 mm Hg for thigh may be used.

Many orthopedic surgeons do not consider the baseline blood pressure of the patient on whom the tourniquets are being applied.

**Complications of Tourniquets:**

Nerve injury is the most common, likely from both mechanical compression and neural ischemia. Nerve injury can range from mild transient loss of function to irreversible damage and paralysis. **Tourniquet Contraindications:**

Limbs with severe infection.  
Poor cardiac reserve.  
Traumatized limbs.     
Peripheral neuropathy.  
DVT in the limb.  
Reynaud's disease.  
PVD

RSD  
   
A safe time limit of 1–3 hours.

Horlocker _et al_. (2006) found a strong correlation of nerve injury with prolonged total tourniquet times; study showed an approximate threefold increase in risk of neurological complications for each 30 minute increase in tourniquet inflation.

  
The use of a tourniquet for >2 hours and pressures of >350 mmHg in lower extremity and >250 mm Hg in upper extremity increases the risk of compression neuropraxia.

If >2 hours is required, the tourniquet should be deflated for 5 minutes for every 30 minutes of inflation time.

The circulator nurse is usually responsible for inflating/deflating the tourniquet when requested. 

We are all taught to document inflation/deflation tourniquet times. The circulator also documents. The tourniquet machine tracks the time. If you forget to document the inflation/deflation time, do not loose any sleep over it.

 Tourniquet pain is an issue in longer cases.
