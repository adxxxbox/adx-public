### EGD with Esophageal Stent Placement

Concerning anesthesia, this procedure is just an extra long EGD procedure. It is more convenient just to intubate the patient rather than possibly struggle with the airway.  
This procedure is done using a pediatric endoscope and fluoroscopy, so you will need a lead apron. An adult endoscope is usually too large to pass the stricture.  
A guide wire is used and the stent is passed just distal to the tumor.  

**Indications of Esophageal Stent**

Malignant dysphagia (from a tumor)-Many with unresectable, resectable, and potentially resectable cancer.  
Esophageal strictures  
Esophageal fistulas  
Esophageal perforations  
Esophageal leaks

**Pre-op:** There is a good chance the patient has copious oral pharyngeal secretions backing up from the esophagus.  
Consider Robinul  
  
**Anesthetic:** General/ ETT, sometimes MAC if the GI doc is really fast

**Muscle Relaxation:** Not needed  
**Duration:** 15-60 minutes  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 22G in acceptable  
**Position:** Supine  

**Possible Complications**  
Laryngeal spasm –MAC case  
Aspiration-increased secretions  
Bleeding and perforation-rare  
Stent migration-rare  
Tumor overgrowth  
Tumor ingrowth (which are more common)
