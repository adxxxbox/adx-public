### Colonoscopy Decompression

A colonoscopy removing excess gas from the colon to avoid perforation.  
  
Concerning anesthesia, this procedure is just a another colonoscopy. Some of these patients may have had nausea and vomiting so you may need to intubate. Be aware that many of these patients may be taking neostigmine in attempt to increase motility. Mild bradycardia may be present.  
**  
Indication Colonoscopy Decompression:**  
Intestinal pseudoobstruction  
**  
Goals:  
**To aspirate the excess gas distending the colon.  
Prevent colonic perforation while treating the primary problems.  
Avoiding a surgical celiotomy and cecostomy.  
**Intestinal pseudoobstruction:** Massive dilatation of the cecum (diameter > 10 cm) and right colon verified from an abdominal X-ray. It usually occurs from a large accumulation of gas to the point of risking perforation. It usually involves the cecum and right hemicolon, although occasionally colonic dilation extends to the rectum. It is usually secondary from another condition.  
  
**Ogilvie syndrome  
**The acute dilation of the colon in the absence of any mechanical obstruction in severely ill patients. Colonic pseudo-obstruction is characterized by massive dilatation of the cecum (diameter > 10 cm) and right colon on abdominal X-ray. The diameter at which the cecum perforates is variable. However, the cecum rarely perforates at a diameter of less than 12 cm.  
  
Massive distention of the colon may result in perforation of the cecum and fecal peritonitis and is associated with a very high mortality rate.  
  
**Colonoscopy Decompression Procedure  
**A colonoscope is inserted into the anus and then is advanced slowly, into the rectum, through the colon (or where the pseudoobstruction is located).  
At this point the colonoscope aspirates the excess gas that is distending the bowel.  
Sometimes a rectal tube may be quickly inserted.  
**Possible Symptoms:  
**Abdominal painBloating  
Constipation  
Nausea and vomiting  
Swollen abdomen (abdominal distention)  
Weight loss  
**Bowel Prep:** Some of these procedures may be difficult to perform because of poor colonic preparation.  
Some type of enema is usually performed preoperatively.**Neostigmine or pyridostigmine:** The patient may be on one of these anticholinergics in attempt to increase motility. Have atropine or robinul at the bedside.  
Most of these patients already have an IV and have been hydrated.  
Pre-op electrolytes and CBC are still needed.  
  
As soon as you get your patient into the room, you should place the NC with ETCO 2 sampling on the patient to build up their FRC while you are connecting the other monitors.Some GI labs are very efficient, allowing little time between the patient entering the room and the start of the procedure.  
  
**Cardiac:** Watch for a vagal effect when air is insufflated into the patient’s colon.  
Arrhythmias from dehydration and a decreased SVR from Propofol are not rare.  
**Equipment:** Appropriate size oral airway, suction and Ambu bag within arm’s reach.  
**Anesthetic:** General TIVA or Total IV Anesthesia with a propofol infusion.  
GETA with RSI for a patient with nausea/vomiting.  
In addition to Propofol, some CRNAs administer 2mg of versed or combine the versed with ketamine. There are many different cocktails.  
  
**Position:** Left lateral with their knees drawn up towards the abdomen. Pillow tucked beneath their head for cervical neutrality.  
It is good to start infusing the Propofol before the GI doc starts inserting a lubricated gloved finger into the anus to check for any abnormal masses or blockages. This is usually not desirable for a patient that is awake.  
**Bedside Meds:** Robinul, Atropine, Ephedrine and Anectine.  
**Duration:** 15-60 minutes  
**IV Access:** 22G is acceptable  
**NG Tube:** most of these patients tend to have one. Connect it suction preoperatively is suggested.**  
  
Possible Complications:  
**Colonic perforation  
Rectal tube obstruction  
Post-polypectomy bleeding  
Postpolypectomy Electrocoagulation Syndrome  
Infection  
Gas Explosion  
Cardiac arrhythmias  
Colonic/rectal ulceration  
  
**More Notes:  
**The most common cause we see is from a secondary decrease in colonic motility from the interruption of the parasympathetic fibers from S2 to S4 leaving an atonic distal colon and a functional proximal obstruction.  
  
**Other possible causes:**  
Cerebral palsy or other nervous system (neurologic) disorders  
Chronic kidney, lung or heart disease.
