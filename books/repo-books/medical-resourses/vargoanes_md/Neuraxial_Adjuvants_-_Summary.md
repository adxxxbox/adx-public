### Neuraxial Adjuvants Summary

**Epinephrine  
Common uses of Epinephrine in neuraxial anesthesia:**  
In epidural test doses to check for accidental intravascular placed catheters.  
Increases the duration of intrathecal and epidural local anesthetics  
  
**Fentanyl and Sufenta  
**Both lipophilic fast-acting narcotics. Fentanyl is much more popular than Sufenta due to price.  
Lipophilic narcotics do not hang around in the CSF to move cephalad and cause a delayed respiratory depression like morphine does. Higher doses of neuraxial narcotics are associated with itching and urinary retention.  
  
**Morphine  
**A slow-acting hydrophilic opioid also used in neuraxial anesthesia. Its advantage over Fentanyl and Sufenta is its duration for post-op analgesia after a C-section. It may last up to 24 hours.  
May cause a delayed respiratory depression.**  
  
Sodium Bicarbonate  
**Sodium bicarbonate is mentioned in every Obstetric Anesthesia book, but realistically rarely used. It can be used with 3% Chloroprocaine to quicken the onset for urgent C-sections with previously placed epidural catheters.  
  
**Clonidine  
**Clonidine improves analgesia without affecting sensation or producing motor blockade.  
Clonidine may ALSO cause sedation, hypotension, and severe bradycardia.  
_FDA has issued a “Black Box” against the use of Clonidine in obstetrics for the concerns of hemodynamic instabilities after its use_ .  
Clonidine is rarely used, but some anesthesia providers still use it at lower doses.  
  
**Precedex  
**Precedex is an alpha-2 agonist, just like Clonidine. It is also rarely used as a neuraxial adjuvant in the US. Precedex does not have the same documented cardiovascular side effects as Clonidine.  
There is little literature on neuraxial Precedex, but it does show more promise than Clonidine.  
  
**Neostigmine  
**Neostigmine is also mentioned in our Obstetric Anesthesia books as an adjuvant to neuraxial anesthesia. We no longer use neostigmine due to nausea and GI side effects.
