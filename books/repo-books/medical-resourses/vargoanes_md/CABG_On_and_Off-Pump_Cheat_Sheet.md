### CABG On and Off-Pump Cheat Sheet

By Samuel Badger, MSN, CRNA, and John Sheetz, MSN, CRNA

The management below may vary among anesthesia providers.

_Refer to the “CABG” section for details._

Cardiopulmonary Bypass: CPB

Systolic Blood Pressure: SBP

Ejection Fraction: EF

Erector Spinae Plane: ESP

**Pre-op:**

ESP block: For sternotomy (optional)

**Room setup:**

**Tabletop:**

8.0 ETT

OG Tube-insert before TEE to de-air the stomach

**Pre-drawn Medications:**

**Fentanyl-20 cc syringe (1,000 mcg)**

250 mcg-500 mcg on induction.

Additional dosing as needed.

It is common to administer all 1000mcg to the patient throughout the procedure.

However, too much fentanyl will result in hypotension, requiring a vasopressor.

**Propofol or Etomidate:**

**Propofol:** 100-150

**Rocuronium or Vecuronium:** Keep the patient paralyzed throughout the entire procedure.

**Heparin:** 30 cc Syringe

300-400 units/kg for CPB surgeries, goal ACT > 400 or >450 seconds

150 units/kg for off-pump CABG, goal > 300 seconds

**Protamine syringe:**

Keep isolated to avoid accidentally giving.

Many anesthesia providers will not draw it up until it is time to administer it.

**Phenylephrine:** 10 mL

**Ephedrine:** 5cc

**Note:** Some anesthesia providers bypass Ephedrine and Phenylephrine and immediately use Norepinephrine.

Have syringes drawn up of **Norepinephrine**, **Epinephrine**, and **Nitroglycerin** at concentrations you are comfortable administering boluses.

**Possible adjuncts of your choosing:**

Decadron

Diphenhydramine

Famotidine

Ondansetron

**Antibiotics:**

Ancef Q 4 hours

Vancomycin when the patient is allergic to penicillin.

**Lines and Infusions:** (Some facilities line their patient preoperatively)

Arterial Line

Central Line - Double stick

2-3 lumen central line

Cordis and swan catheter

**Blood set on a fluid warmer primed with either:**

Plasma-lyte or

Normosol-R or

NS

**Drips:**

Separate carrier line for infusion (all primed and on a pump)

\- **Nitroglycerin:** 5-20mcg/min

\- **Norepinephrine:** 0.02mcg/kg/min - 0.06 typically but as high as needed

\- **Epinephrine:** Same as norepinephrine

\- **Insulin:** 2-10 units/hr, goal- glucose less than 160 or less than 180

\- **Dexmedetomidine:** 0.5-0.8mcg/kg/hr started when closing the chest and continued up to ICU.

Some anesthesia providers will start the Dexmedetomidine at the beginning of the case.

When ERAS is requested, infuse at 0.3 mcg/kg/hour the entire case.

**Have available but not need to prime:**

\- **Dobutamine:** 2-3 mcg/kg/min; we only use this for our off-pump CABG.

It works great to increase CI with an elevated SVR

\- **Milrinone:** 0.2-0.5mcg/kg/min used when coming off pump along with epinephrine for cases when the right side of the heart needs additional support.

**\- Amiodarone:** Incase the surgeon request it.

Bolus with 150mg, then 1mg/min for 6 hours, and finally 0.5mg/min for 18 hours.

**Other equipment:**

**Defibrillator settings:**

**Settings:** 200 joules for external and 10-20 for internal paddles.

Place patches on the patient once they enter the OR.

The surgeon has internal paddles.

**Patient warming device:** Underbody Bair Hugger or underbody heating pad

BIS monitor

Cerebral oximetry, if available

**Induction and presurgical tasks:**

Peripheral IV placed in pre-op holding

2 mg of midazolam prior to entering the OR

**Patient arrival to OR:**

Monitors and defibrillator pads are placed on the patient.

**Standard induction:**

**Fentanyl:** 250 mcg-500 mcg

Use vasopressors to maintain stable blood pressure and heart rate.

ETT placed and confirmed

If not done preoperatively, a central line, cordis, and PA catheter are inserted in the OR.

TEE is inserted, and a pre-procedure evaluation is done.

**Shoot opening cardiac index (CI):**

\- The goal is to maintain an adequate cardiac index greater than 2.0.

\- Whether it is pre-CPB, post-CPB, or off-pump CABG, using your infusions to ensure a CI greater than 2.0 is key to successful surgery.

\- The start of any cardiac surgery is exceptionally stimulating and will require additional narcotics and or the use of nitroglycerin to prevent hypertension.

\- Patients who received ESB blocks will not require a large dose of fentanyl just prior to sternotomy.

\- When the surgeon is ready to perform a sternotomy, they will activate the sternal saw before beginning the sternotomy.

\- At this time, it is imperative that respirations are stopped, and the breathing circuit is disconnected from the anesthesia machine.

\- This results in lung deflation, which decreases the chances of lung perforation with sternotomy.

\- Once the sternotomy is complete and chest saw is tuned off, respirations can be resumed.

**Grafts harvested:**

\- Grafts will be harvested if a CABG is performed.

\- Depending on surgeon preferences, they will use one or both internal mammary arteries, radial arteries, or saphenous veins as grafts.

\- During this time, your drips are used to maintain CI, BP, and HR within normal ranges.

\- Tilt the bed left so the surgeon can better visualize the left mammary artery for harvesting.

**On CPB surgeries:**

\- If you are performing anesthesia for any on-pump CPB surgery, once grafts are harvested, the surgeon will ask for heparin to be administered and for the ACT to be checked.

\- You will now work to get your systolic blood pressure between 75 and 90 mmHg.

\- This will allow the surgeon to insert the cannulas for CPB safely.

\- Once cannulas are placed, perfusion may draw blood back through the arterial and venous cannulas to the perfusion machine to prime the machine with the patient’s heparinized blood.

\- This is called Retrograde Autologous Priming or RAP and is used to decrease hemodilution.

\- This process may require additional vasopressors, but they should be given cautiously so that the systolic blood pressure (SBP) does not exceed 100 mmHg.

\- Once full CPB is initiated, turn off respirations and vaporizer, announcing “gas off” to remind perfusion to turn the vaporizer.

**Cardioplegia:**

\- The surgeon will place cardioplegia lines either in the aortic root for antegrade delivery or in the coronary sinus for retrograde delivery of the cardioplegic solution.

\- This solution causes the heart to arrest and is cold to protect the myocardium.

\- A clamp is placed between the aortic cannula and the heart, emptying the heart of blood.

\- The CABG or valve surgery is then underway.

**While the patient is on CPB, anesthesia is responsible for two jobs:**

\-Adjust the OR table and maintain normal blood glucose levels.

\-Perfusion will draw i-Stat labs at regular intervals so you can monitor glucose values.

\-Once the procedures are complete, rewarming begins.

\-Perfusion will begin warming up the blood returning to the patient.

\-The surgeon will remove the aorta cross-clamp.

\-Blood is then allowed to refill the heart and perfusion through the coronary arteries or new coronary artery grafts will begin.

\-Along with the use of epicardial pacing wires, the heart starts beating again.

**Epinephrine drip before coming off CPB:**

\-Many experienced anesthesia providers start a low-dose epinephrine infusion once the aorta cross-clamp comes off, even as low as 0.02 mcg/kg/min, but the typical range is 0.04-0.06.

\-Once off pump, you can always continue the infusion and adjust according to CI and BP.

\-Epinephrine and possibly other inotropes may help support the heart during this time.

**Coming off-pump:**

\-When it is time to separate from the CPB, these medications are maintained and goal-directed for CI > 2.0.

\-Additional fluids such as albumin and cell saver are given to the patient to aid in volume resuscitation.

\-Blood pressure should be maintained between 90 and 110 mmHg.

\-If blood pressure increases > 120 mmHg, the risk of bleeding increases from the cannula sites.

\-Protamine is administered 1.3 times the ml dose of heparin, giving you the ml dose of protamine.

\-Shoot CI immediately coming off CPB and once the chest is closed.

\-Dexmedetomidine is used for patient sedation in the ICU.

**Off-Pump CABG:**

\- These procedures are more labor-intensive for anesthesia and require a great working relationship with the surgeon.

\- Anesthesia must be acutely aware of what the surgeon is doing and planning to do at all times.

\- Grafting while off CPB causes severe hemodynamic changes.

\- The surgeon lifts and supports the heart in extreme positions so they can access graft sites.

\- The heart is commonly lifted from the axis for the surgeon to graft posterior sites.

\- This will also cause a change in the appearance of the EKG tracing due to the change in the axis/vector of the monitoring. BP, HR, and CI all must be maintained for the surgery to be successfully completed off CPB.

\- At my hospital, all CABG surgeries are performed off-pump and are highly successful.

**Pearls for CABG:**

**CI maintained > 2.0**

\- Dobutamine and epinephrine are very commonly used to maintain CI.

\- These infusions improve CI, BP, and HR and are used while the heart is placed in compromised positions.

**Norepinephrine:** Inotrope that increases SVR

**Epinephrine:** Inotrope that increases HR and SVR

**Dobutamine:** Inotrope that decreases SVR (may increase HR)

**Milrinone:** Inotrope that decreases SVR

**Scenarios with CI to SVR:**

**↓ CI with ↓ SVR:**

Use Norepinephrine or Epinephrine

**↓ CI with ↑ SVR:**

Use Dobutamine or Milrinone or Dobutamine + Norepinephrine

Avoid Norepinephrine and/or epinephrine alone

****Milrinone:** Can be used for left and/or right heart failure**

**Nitroglycerin is commonly used.**

\- Even low-dose infusion at 5-10 mcg/min will help coronary artery perfusion of current and new grafts.

\- Nitroglycerin also helps offload volume, decrease vascular resistance, and prevent vasospasm of arterial grafts.

\-Have perfusion check ACT and i-Stat every 20 minutes.

\-If ACT is less than 300 seconds after the initial bolus, give 5000 units of heparin and recheck.

\-Treat I-Stat values to maintain normal pH, K+, iCa, and glucose.

\-Giving bicarb, potassium, and calcium is very common throughout the surgery.

**Heparin reversal:**

Reversal of heparin with protamine is done with a much smaller dose.

Typically, only a 75 mg dose of protamine is required to return an ACT of 300 seconds to a baseline of nearly 100 seconds.

BP values can and should be more liberal.

Because there are no cannula sites in the aorta

BP is allowed and encouraged to be higher.

Increasing the BP up to 140s or even 150s before grafts that require extreme heart positioning will prevent hypotension.

**Communication for off-pump CABG:**

\-The most important aspect of these surgeries is communication with the surgeon.

\-The surgeon needs to be aware of any problems you may have.

\- Grafting while off CPB will cause ischemic changes to the heart that will be obvious with increased PA pressures and ST elevations.

\-These situations need to be communicated to the surgeon.

\- Learn the surgeon's regiment and likes/dislikes.

\- This will allow you to anticipate what he/she will do next.

**Minimally Invasive Mitral Valve Surgery:**

\-Very similar to on-pump surgeries except for two differences.

\-Double lumen ETT is required for one-lung ventilation pre- and post-CPB.

\-Femoral arterial and venous cannulation for CPB.

\-This type of cannulation will require the use of the TEE to see if the guide wires are in the correct vessels.
