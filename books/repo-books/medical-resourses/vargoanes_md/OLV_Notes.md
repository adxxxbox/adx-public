### One Lung Ventilation (OLV) Notes

  
_Steven L. Belmont, DNP, CRNA, APRN_

**One Lung Ventilation (OLV)**

Once a lung is let down, you will switch to OLV.  
You will immediately need to make ventilator changes to prevent lung trauma.  
TV (6-8 mL/kg of predicted body weight\*)  
PEEP 5-10 cm H2O (caution in patients with severe obstructive disease)  
Respiratory rate to maintain PaCO2 between 35-40 mmHg  
Maintain PIP to <35 cm H20  
Plateau pressures <25 cmH20.

A FIO2 of 1.0 is usually recommended to prevent hypoxemia however, some authors recommend titrating FIO2 (higher FIO2 can cause absorption atelectasis). The use of Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV) might be helpful to limit high airway pressures however, this mode of ventilation has not been demonstrated to show a decrease in lung injury or improve oxygenation as compared to volume control ventilation. If the patient is placed on this mode, you must watch the TVs closely as they can change suddenly.

**_Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction (HPV) reflex_**

The HPV reflex causes pulmonary vasoconstriction that shunts blood away from the nonventilated lung (up to 50%), thus helping prevent hypoxemia. The reflex is primarily initiated when the alveolar oxygen tension (PAO2) becomes <100 mmHg. At this point, precapillary vasoconstriction occurs which causes the blood to redistribute to the ventilated lung. The reflex occurs in two phases: the initial phase (occurs within minutes) and the delayed phase (starts at ~40 mins). Several anesthetic factors can increase or decrease this reflex so you must keep this in mind when as you tailor your anesthetic management.

**Causes that Increase the HPV reflex:**  
Metabolic and respiratory acidosis  
Hypercapnia  
Mild decreased mixed venous oxygenation  
Hyperthermia.

**Causes of decrease in HPV reflex:**  
Metabolic and respiratory alkalosis  
Hypocapnia  
Hypothermia  
Increased LA pressure  
_Inhalation Agent >1 MAC_  
Hemodilution (fluid overload- limit fluids!)  
Vasodilators, vasopressors (constrict blood vessels in the dependent lung).

**Hypoxia:**

Incidence (SPO2 <90%) occurs ~5% of the time and is usually a result of shunting. There are several factors that predict the occurrence of hypoxia during OLV: 1) low pO2 prior to OLV, left sided ventilation (right thoracotomy), normal FEV1 or FVC or restrictive lung disease, and the supine position (we currently do robotic thymectomies in the supine position and this has occurred), or high % of ventilation/perfusion to the operative lung.

**Treatment:**  
Increase the FIO2 to 100% if not already.  
If your SaO2 is continuing to drop, you should re-inflate the other lung temporarily (if possible) after consulting with surgeon.  
HPV reflex works better with repeated hypoxic events so resuming OLV might be successful. Confirm DLT placement with a FOB (one main cause of desaturation is tube malposition which can occur during positioning and surgical manipulation) and suction any secretions in the tube. Assess cardiac output to assure it is adequate (surgical manipulation could cause a decrease in CO).  
Make sure IA is <1 MAC.  
Perform recruitment maneuvers to treat possible atelectasis.  
SaO2 may continue to drop initially and then start to increase.  
Consider adding additional PEEP to the dependent lung.  
You must do recruitment maneuvers before completing this step.  
CPAP (5-10 cm H2O) can be applied to the nondependent lung to increase PaO2.  
This maneuver may impair the ability of the surgeon to visualize and operate when procedure is being done thoracoscopically.  
Remember factors that affect the HPV reflex!  
A differential diagnosis could be a pneumothorax especially in patients with COPD.
