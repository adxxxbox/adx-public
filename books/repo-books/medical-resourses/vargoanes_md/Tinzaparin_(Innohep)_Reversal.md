### Tinzaparin (Innohep) Reversal

_Currently, there is a lack of specific antidotes for the growing number of new (novel) anticoagulants that are slowly replacing warfarin and heparin. For this reason, there is NO universal standard of care for the treatment of the anticoagulated bleeding patient when there is no specific antidote._

**Consult cardiology for ALL patients with coronary stents.**

**Quick Notes** Tinzaparin is a LMWH.  
**Half-life:** 3.9 hours.  
  
**Subcutaneous injection:** half-life is prolonged.  
  
**Specific antidote:** Protamine.  
**Tinzaparin (Innohep) Reversal.****When last dose of tinzaparin was within 8 hours:** 1mg protamine per 100 units.**When last dose of tinzaparin was within 8-12 hours:** 0.5 mg protamine per 100 anti-Xa.Repeat dose 0.5 mg protamine for every 100 units of **tinzaparin** given if bleeding continues or elevated anti‐factor Xa activity level after 2‐4 hours. If bleeding persists in an imminent life threatening event, FEIBA 8 to 25 units/kg can be considered.  
  
**Low Molecular Weight Heparin Reversal of Bleeding  
**Protamine sulfate may be used as a partial reversal agent (neutralizes approximately 60% of LMWH’s anti‐factor Xa activity).  
LMWH: major bleeding occurs in 1-4% depending on dose and underlying condition.  
  
**Protamine Facts**  
Maximum single dose is 50mg.  
Never bolus: may result in profound HYPOtension.  
  
**Protamine Allergy**  
Increased risk of hypersensitivity reaction, including anaphylaxis, in patients with a fish allergy or prior exposure to protamine.  
Premedicate with corticosteroids and antihistamines if at risk for protamine allergy.  
  
**AntiXa Activity (LMWXA) monitoring with LMWH (when needed)**  
If measuring is desired, check peak antiXa level 3-4 hours after dose.  
Observed peak AntiXa levels for Q12h dosing of LMWHs = 0.5-1 units/mL.  
Observed peak antiXa levels for Q24h dosing of LMWHs = 1-2 units per mL.  
Trough antiXa levels may be checked prior to the next dose: < 0.5 units/mL.  
Elevated troughs suggest impaired clearance.  
aPTT displays a linear dose-response to LMWH but, there is still variation.  
  
**LMWH Therapeutic Ranges (target anti-Xa levels measured 4 hours after dosing):  
Tinzaparin (Innohep):**  
Therapeutic Q-day dosing 0.85.  
  
**Non-urgent**  
Hold tinzaparin the day of procedure.  
**Once-daily regimens:** May consider ½ dose day prior to procedure.  
**Twice-daily regimens:** Hold evening dose day prior and morning of procedure.  
  
**Urgent: No major bleeding.  
**Wait 12-24 hours if possible.  
Consider protamine sulfate if a delay not possible for high bleeding risk procedures.  
  
**Life-Threatening Bleed  
**Hematology/Coagulation consult is recommended.  
Protamine sulfate.  
Additional products may be needed to obtain hemostasis.
