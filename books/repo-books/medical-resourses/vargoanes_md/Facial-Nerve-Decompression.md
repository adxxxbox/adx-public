### Facial Nerve Decompression

**(Mastoid Decompression of the Facial Nerve)**

**Indication:** To decompress an area of facial nerve compression. The surgeon can make a transmastoid or middle fossa approach (1 inch behind the ear). The facial nerve sheath is identified and opened. The surgeon removes bone that is decompressing the facial nerve.

**Review:** The Facial Nerve travels through a bony canal in the temporal bone called the internal auditory canal (IAC).  The nerve exits the IAC and makes a sharp turn to enter the middle ear space. It then makes a second sharp turn to enter the mastoid bone of the skull.  The nerve then traverses the mastoid bone and exits the skull in front of the ear, where it splits into several branches. 

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT or sometimes an LMA.  
**Positioning:** Supine; head turned away with ipsilateral arm tucked.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Usually do not need it.  
**Duration:** 1-2.5 hours; depends on the surgeon.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
**Facial Nerve Monitoring:** Check with the surgeon.  
**Emergence:** Smooth  
**EBL:** Minimal  
Consider PONV meds and steroids.
