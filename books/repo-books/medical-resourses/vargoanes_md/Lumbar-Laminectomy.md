Lumbar Laminectomy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Lumbar Laminectomy

A Laminectomy is usually part of another back procedure. This procedure enlarges the spinal canal so nerves have more room. Typically, surgeons have to perform a discectomy with a laminectomy. If a fusion is performed, everything is the same except the procedure has a longer duration.

**Anesthetic**: General / ETT  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Usually, just check with the surgeon.

**Duration**: 1-2 hours  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable. Make sure the IV site is not an AC site. It may kink when the arms are flexed 90 degrees.  
**Antibiotics:** Usually Ancef, unless contraindicated.  
Neuro Monitoring: Usually not but this will depend on the surgeon.  
**Position:** Most are prone: Prone with knees to chest on an Andrews Frame. Before you log roll the patient onto the OR table, make sure you have a foam cradle or Prone View on the patient’s face. Most of us place some type of eye goggles over the patient’s eyes for protection. Many of us use a flex accordion type of anesthesia circuit tubing extender for the ETT. Reconnect the ventilator tubing and monitors. Please re-auscultate lung sounds after turning the patient. Arms pronated out and up < 90 degrees into the flying superman position. Make sure the chest rolls are in proper place and the shoulders are padded.  
Eyes, ears, and nose should be checked to assure that these areas are free from pressure. The ETT should be free without kinking or undue traction, and you should be able to visually see and have access to all your tubing connections.

Before moving the patient to knee-chest in the Andrews frame bed, Inform the OR team when you are ready to hold the patient’s head in the neutral position. When the bed is adjusted, the patient will be moved into a kneeling position. The patient will slide with the knee positioning and the head will want to extend back. This is why you need to maintain cervical neutrality during positioning.

**Possible Complications**:Dural tear and cerebrospinal fluid leak: This occurs in 1-2% of these surgeries. It does not change the results of surgery, but post-operatively the patient may be asked to lay recumbent for one to two days to allow the leak to seal.  
Nerve root damage  
Bowel/bladder incontinence  
Bleeding  
Infection  

**More Notes on Laminectomy**:  
This is a neurosurgical procedure that relieves pressure on spinal nerves caused by wear and tear on portions of the spine that can create bony spurs or protrusions. 

A laminectomy involves the trimming or removal of the lamina bone, which is the arched portion of the vertebrae of the spine.

Sometimes we use the terms laminectomy or partial laminectomy; also called a laminotomy.

Typically, surgeons have to perform a discectomy with a laminectomy. The discectomy is where the surgeon removes the herniated portion of the disk. The laminectomy is needed if the surgeon has to cut a window through vertebrae so he/she can get to the disk. It really depends on where the herniation occurs.

Many surgeons prefer either anterior decompression of the spinal cord and nerve roots, or an adaptation of a laminectomy known as a laminoplasty, depending on the patient's anatomy.
