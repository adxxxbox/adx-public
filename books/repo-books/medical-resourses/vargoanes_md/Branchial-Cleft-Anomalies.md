Branchial Cleft Anomaly Notes   

## Branchial Cleft Anomaly Notes

The branchial apparatus includes the face, neck, oropharynx and larynx. In the 5th week of gestation, the branchial apparatus takes shape, with the appearance of six pharyngeal arches. The arches are laterally extending bands of tissue that are connected by branchial plates. Areas on each side of the branchial plate are known as clefts and pouches. Externally, the space is a branchial cleft and internally, the space is a branchial pouch.

The endoderm within the branchial pouches becomes specialized and eventually transforms into important structures of the neck and face.

The branchial apparatus drastically changes shape as the exterior second branchial arch overgrows caudally. This downward growth will form the platysma muscle.

**If the branchial cyst or Sinus of His remains:  
**The sinus of His is the combined opening of the second, third and fourth clefts. When the sinus of His fuses, it leaves a single branchial cleft cyst.  
In normal embryologic development, this cleft is obliterated when the walls of the cleft fuse. However, if the branchial cleft cyst or sinus of His persists, the result is an epithelial lined pocket still present after birth. This pocket can take the form of a cyst, sinus, or fistula which may be present at birth, or may be discovered later in life.

Branchial cleft anomalies are rare congenital defects that occur in many different ways in the head and neck.

A branchial cleft anomaly can be a cyst, sinus or fistula. If it is a fistula, it travels from the surface of the neck to the oral pharynx.

They may lead to a lateral neck mass that may affect the nearby neck structures, causing compressive symptoms or vessel thrombosis.

17% of all pediatric cervical masses are due to branchial anomalies.

**Symptoms:**

Intermittent or continuous mucous discharge.

Recurrent attacks of inflammation.

Frank cellulitis or abscess formation may occur, requiring an incision and drainage.

**Diagnosis:**  
A Fistulogram will show if there is a tract extending from the opening in the neck. It displays length and the location of the tract.

X-ray  
CT Scan.  
MRI

**Age Range:** Neonate – Adult

Diagnosis may occur at any age.  
89% are on the right side.

As mentioned above, branchial anomalies are further typed into cysts, sinuses, and fistulas.

**Cyst:  
**Are considered to be entrapped remnants of branchial cleft or sinuses; sinuses are remnants of cleft or pouches. There is no internal or external communication and 30% may occur independently, or in association with a branchial pouch sinus or fistula.  
The cysts are more common than the sinus and fistula anomalies by a ratio of around 2:1.

**Fistula:**  
22% occurrence. This is a complete connection between the skin and pharynx. So it communicates both internally and externally.

**Sinus:**  
42% occurrence. Sinuses are remnants of cleft or pouches. It is just a blind pouch (incomplete tract) that is attached to either the skin or pharynx.

Depending on the anatomic location, branchial anomalies are classified into first, second, third, and fourth anomalies. 95% of congenital anomalies of the branchial apparatus involve the “SECOND” branchial arch, pouch, or cleft.

**First branchial cleft anomalies (5-8% occurrence)**  
First branchial cleft cyst  
First branchial cleft fistula  
First branchial cleft sinus

**Second branchial cleft anomalies (commonest by far: 90-95%)**  
Second branchial cleft cyst  
Second branchial cleft fistula  
Second branchial cleft sinus

**Third branchial cleft anomalies (rare)  
**Third branchial cleft cyst  
Third branchial cleft fistula  
Third branchial cleft sinus

_The 3rd and 4th branchial arches tend to be very close and therefore the distinction between these two cleft anomalies can be difficult on imaging._

**Fourth branchial cleft anomalies (rare)  
**Fourth branchial cleft cyst  
Fourth branchial cleft fistula  
Fourth branchial cleft sinus

**Indications for Treatment**  
Infection  
Mass effect (dysphagia, dyspnea, pain)  
Cosmetic  

**Treatment** - Complete surgical excision.

**Surgery:** It is important for the surgeon to know the specific branchial anomaly prior to surgery, which clarifies potential complications.

**More Notes:**  
“Branchia” is the Greek word for gill, and the same word represents these anomalies owing to their resemblance to gills of certain species as fish. Six paired branchial arches, which appear in the fourth week of embryonic life, give rise to many structures of the head and neck.

The anomalies result from branchial apparati (6 arches) which are the embryologic precursors of the ear and the muscles, blood vessels, bones, cartilage, and mucosal lining of the face, neck, and pharynx. The 6 branchial arches give rise to 5 clefts.
