# Cryoabation for Atrial Fibrillation

(Pulmonary Vein Isolation)

For anesthesia, this case is similar to an A-Fib ablation. You will intubate and keep the patient motionless. Always ask the cardiologist before relaxing the patient. Phrenic nerve monitoring may be applied while mapping the heart.  
Recent studies have found cryoablation to be significantly more effective than medication, and less painful than heat based radiofrequency ablation.  
Atrial Fibrillation occurs in the population between the ages of 50-80. Sleep Apnea was noted to be one of the leading causes for A-Fib.  
**There are 3 types of A-Fib**  
Paroxysmal  
Persistent  
Chronic  
  
Cryoablation is for paroxysmal or persistent A-Fib and and NOT for Chronic A-Fib.  
Just as heat based radiofrequency ablation, the doctor inserts catheter from the groin (femoral vein) up to the right atrium and goes through the atrial septum to get into the left atrium. With cryoablation, a balloon catheter is used. After the heart is mapped, the doctor will locate each ostium of the four pulmonary veins (one at a time).  
  
The physician inflates the balloon and positions it to the opening of the pulmonary vein. The goal is to close off the opening of the pulmonary vein completely, which stops the flow of blood between the atrium and the vein (this is called occlusion). Once occlusion is confirmed, the physician introduces liquid refrigerant into the balloon. The refrigerant evaporates and removes heat from the heart tissue at the opening of the pulmonary vein where the balloon is in contact with it. As a result, the tissue is scarred and may no longer spread the electrical currents that cause atrial fibrillation.  
  
Unlike heat-based ablation, cryoablation allows physicians to cool tissue to make sure it is on the area causing an irregularity. If it is not, simply allowing the tissue to thaw and re-warm can restore the site’s normal electrical function.  
  
  
**Success rate depends on:**  
Duration of the A-Fib  
Presence of valve disease  
Presence of CAD  
Type of A-Fib (paroxysmal or persistent)  
Size of the atria.  
  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
**Muscle Relaxant:** Yes, absolutely no movement while ablating the inside of the heart. No relaxation in the beginning if phrenic nerve pacing is being applied. Also large magnets are precisely aligned with the patient.  
**Duration:** 2-5 hours.  
**EBL:** Hopefully minimal.  
**IV Access:** Preferably two 18G IVs in case of complications. The patient will also have venous introducers in place.  
**A-Line:** Yes, because the ablation is in the left heart.  
**IV Tubing Extension:** It helps. Tubing extension with a 3-way stopcock to administer meds without having to get up right next to the patient is becoming more popular. The less radiation exposure, the better.  
**Position:** Supine with arms tucked.  
**Foley:** Yes.  
**Hydration:** Normovolemic  
**Heparin bolus and drip:** Yes, the EP staff usually provides the heparin infusion to you.  
**Esophageal Temp Probe:** Yes, some places prefer a pediatric temp probe. You will be instructed to alert the cardiologist for any small temperature DECREASES (while ablating the posterior left atrium).  
  
_Note: The location of the esophagus relative to the posterior left atrium varies and can be as close as 1cm. Monitoring an esophageal temp can warn us for one of the FATAL complications- “atrio-esophageal fistula.” This occurs less with cryoablation.  
  
_**Neosynephrine Drip:** Yes, but be aware that Neosynephrine may mask the initial drop in BP from a tamponade. I’ve seen some cardiologists ask us not to use Neosynephrine for this reason.  
**Emergency Meds:** Yes, diluted Epinephrine and Ephedrine are your choice drugs for a cardiac tamponade. Have them ready.  
**Lead Apron:** Make sure you get one that fits because you will be there a long time.  
**Foley:** Yes.  
**Emergence:** Normal, deep or awake extubation.  
Depending on the EP lab you are in, the anesthesia space is usually limited.  
  
**Possible Complications:**  
Atrial perforation: Leading to a cardiac tamponade from over burning the atrium. This may require the chest to be opened. Be prepared to transport the patient to an open- heart room if you are not already in one.  
Aortic perforation  
Air Embolus  
Atrio-esophageal fistula with related complications  
Inadvertent puncture of the femoral artery  
Femoral vein hematoma  
  
**Cardiac Tamponade:** If you see your arterial waveform dampen with a drop in BP, immediately troubleshoot the A-line while you notify the cardiologist. The doctor will want to know right away, even if it’s a false alarm. The doctor will usually have a portable ultrasound up near the patient and he/she could immediately check for a cardiac tamponade.  
**Treatment:** Don’t panic and DON’T try to start additional IVs. Just open your fluids wide open. Treat the hypotension with your diluted Ephedrine or Epinephrine. Neosynephrine is NOT the drug of choice for a cardiac tamponade. They have at least 4 HUGE venous introducers up in the 2 femoral veins (some are 8 Fr); they should be able to connect one and give volume if needed.  
  
**Pericardiocentesis and Cardiac Tamponade**  
The cardiologist uses some large syringes and a stopcock that comes with the pericardiocentesis kit and performs a pericardiocentesis. The blood that is aspirated will be reinjected directly into the large femoral line by simply turning a stopcock. You will be asked to give Protamine to reverse the heparin, hoping the paper thin perforated atrium will eventually clot. If the atrium continues to bleed, the patient will immediately be transported to the operating room for a thoracic surgeon to open the chest and repair the atrium. While the surgeon has full access to the heart, a Maze Procedure can also be performed to treat the A-fib. The Maze procedure takes a few minutes.  
  
**Atrio-Esophageal Fistula**  
This fistula is a rare but often a fatal complication of atrial ablation to the posterior wall of the left atrium. Symptoms compatible with endocarditis will develop 3 to 5 days after the procedure. Emergency cardiac surgery is critical if the diagnosis is confirmed. An esophageal temp probe is utilized to warn us when the catheter may be damaging the posterior atrial wall. The use of general anesthesia increases the risk of esophageal damage form the ablation versus patients undergoing conscious sedation.  
  
**Possible Complications**  
Perforation of the heart  
Stroke  
Heart attack  
Narrowing of the pulmonary veins  
Bleeding and/or hematoma at the entry site in the leg.  
Damage to the phrenic nerve  
  
Atrial Fibrillation ablations are done on the patients who have Paroxysmal AF because patients with this type respond better to catheter treatment. In the past, A-Fib was ablated using radiofrequency ablation which involves using heat to damage the muscle sleeve surrounding the pulmonary veins. Today, cryoablation is the new treatment in which the catheter takes away heat in order to damage the tissue. Today, A-Fib ablations have an 85% efficacy rate as compared to a 30-40% efficacy rate of 8 years ago.  
  
**More Notes**  
1\. Cryoablation reduces the chance of having an atrial esophageal fistula. These fistulas are not really noticed until the patient presents to the E.R. complaining of vague symptoms. Since the procedure could have been done a month prior to the E.R. visit, they forget to mention the ablation. As a result the patient may end up septic and ultimately dying.  
2\. Transesophageal temp probe are used and you may be asked to manipulate it during the procedure. They are looking for a sudden decrease in temperature. The temp should not fall below 28 degrees Celsius.  
3\. ETCO2 may go down when occluding the Pulmonary veins.  
4\. Brief hypotension may occur during thawing after each cryo treatment. Communicate with Dr. Rodak that the pressure is low before treating with vasopressors. Pacing in the SVC allows the monitoring of the phrenic nerve.
