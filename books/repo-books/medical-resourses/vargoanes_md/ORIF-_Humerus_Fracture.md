### ORIF of Humerus Fracture

**Open Reduction and Fixation of Humerus Fracture**  
  
An incision will be made and a metal plate, various wires, nails or pins will be attached to the humerus to hold the broken bone in place while it heals. This minimizes complications in which the bones either do not join correctly (mal-union) or start healing without forming a bond between the two (non-union).

A guide wire may be drilled through the fracture ends of the bone to stabilize the reduction. A C-Arm is used to confirm the union.  
  
**Anesthetic:** General/ Usually LMA; an ETT with RSI if patient has not been NPO.  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**IV Access:** 20G is common. IV and a BP cuff on the non-operative arm.

**Position:** Supine or slight lateral.  
**EBL:** It depends where the fracture is. A proximal fracture is too high up to use a tourniquet. For a distal fracture, there may be room for a tourniquet.

A regional block can be done pre-operatively for post op pain.

**Proximal Humerus Fracture:** An Interscalene block is used.

  
**Distal Humerus Fracture (Epicondylar, Intercondylar and Supacondylar):** An Interscalene, supraclavicular, infraclavicular or axillary nerve block can be used.

  
  **Possible Complications:**  
Screw perforation of the humeral head is most common.  
Subacromial impingement due to plate positioning.  
Adhesive capsulitis.  
Postoperative superficial/deep infections.  
Varus malreduction.  
Embolus  
DVT
