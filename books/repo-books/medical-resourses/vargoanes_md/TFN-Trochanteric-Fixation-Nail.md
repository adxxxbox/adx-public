### TFN (Trochanteric Fixation Nail)

Intertrochanteric fractures are considered 1 of 3 types of hip fractures. The anatomic site of this type of hip fracture is the proximal or upper part of the femur.  
**The proximal femur consists of**:  
femoral head  
femoral neck  
trochanteric region  
 

An intertrochanteric hip fracture occurs between the greater trochanter, where the gluteus medius and minimus muscles (hip extensors and abductors) attach, and the lesser trochanter, where the iliopsoas muscle (hip flexor) attaches.

Hip fractures are an epidemic among the elderly population. In the treatment of stable intertrochanteric fracture patterns, lag screw and side plate constructs have become the implant of choice.

TFNs devices for the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures have theoretical advantages over side plate implants.

A 2–3 cm incision is made along the lateral thigh immediately proximal to the palpable prominence of the greater trochanter.

**Anesthesia:** General/ETT or LMA.  Due to the patient’s leg pain, we usually put the patient asleep on their bed/stretcher, and then slide the patient over on the operating room table. A Spinal and a NC with ETCO2 sampling is also common. Propofol is usually given to position the patient lateral for the spinal because of their present hip pain.  
**Position:** Supine with the bed elevated. A fracture table is used with the application of axial traction to the injured extremity. The leg is manipulated to obtain an acceptable reduction. Arms are flexed over their abdomen and the bed is elevated for this procedure.

**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable. The AC site is not preferred since the arms may be flexed across the thorax.

**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**EBL:** 50-300 mLs.  
**Neosynephrine Drip:** Usually; most of these patients are old and volume depleted.

**Average time from injury to fixation:** 2 days, so they should be NPO. 

**Possible Complications:**  
Local wound infection.  
Cutting out of the helical blade through the cortex of the femoral head.  
DVT  
Fat embolus.

**Other Notes**

The primary treatment options for intertrochanteric hip fractures are a sliding hip screw (SHS) and an intramedullary device, with each having its own advantages and disadvantages.

The Long Trochanteric Fixation Nail (LTFN) is a titanium alloy cephalo-medullary nail indicated for treatment of proximal femur fractures, including intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric varieties.
