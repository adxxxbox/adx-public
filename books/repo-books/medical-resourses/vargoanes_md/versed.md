### Versed (Midazolam)

Midazolam is a benzodiazipine central nervous system (CNS) depressant.  
**\- Brand Name:** Versed  
**\- Generic Name:** Midazolam  
**\- Other Brand Names:** Buccolam, Nayzilam Seizalam**\- FDA Approved:** 1985  
**\- Drug Class:** Benzodiazepine  
**\- Benzodiazepine antagonist (antidote):** Flumazenil (Romazicon)  
**\- Possible routes of administration:** PO, Sublingual, Buccal, Nasal, IM, IV  
**\- Onset:** < 1 minute  
  
**\- Benzodiazepines:** **(BZD,** **BDZ,** **BZs),** sometimes called **"benzos"** or **"blues,”** are a class of psychoactive drugs whose core chemical structure is the fusion of a benzene ring and a diazepine ring.\- They are central nervous system depressants and schedule IV-controlled substances.  
  
**Other common benzodiazepines:**  
Diazepam (Valium®)  
Lorazepam (Ativan®)  
Alprazolam (Xanax®)  
Chlordiazepoxide (Librium®)  
Clonazepam (Klonopin®)  
  
**Equivalent dose of 0.15-0.3 mg of Midazolam:  
**Diazepam: 0.3-0.5 mg  
Lorazepam: 0.05 mg  
Midazolam has the shortest duration, followed by lorazepam and diazepam.  
  
**IV compatibility with midazolam:  
**\- 5% dextrose in water and 0.9% sodium chloride: For up to 24 hours  
\- Lactated Ringer’s solution: For up to 4 hours.  
\- Midazolam has replaced diazepam (Valium) for preoperative conscious sedation.  
\- It is the most commonly used benzodiazepine in the perioperative period.  
  
**Anesthesia requirements are decreased:**  
\- Anesthetic requirements for volatile anesthetics are decreased in a dose-dependent manner by midazolam.**Method of action:  
\- Note:** Benzodiazepines do not directly activate GABA-A receptors but require GABA.\- Versed and other benzodiazepines increase the activity of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.  
\- This results in increasing the activity of GABA-A receptors which increases the frequency of chloride channel opening, causing the hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic cell membrane.  
\- The postsynaptic neurons are thus rendered more resistant to excitation.  
\- This resistance to excitation is presumed to be the mechanism by which benzodiazepines produce the properties listed below.  
  
**GABA-A receptors are mainly located:**  
CNS  
Heart and skeletal muscle (in fewer amounts)  
**Benzodiazepines possess the following properties** **from activation of GABA-A:**  
Psycholeptic  
Sedative  
Hypnotic  
Anxiolytic  
Anticonvulsant  
Anterograde amnesia (acquisition or encoding of new information).  
Muscle relaxant (spinal cord–mediated)  
Induces sleep  
  
**Indications:**  
Oral preoperative medication for childrenIntravenous preoperative sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia  
Postoperative sedation  
Anesthesia induction (as per FDA)-rare  
Seizure (not the first choice)  
  
**Duration of midazolam:** 2-6 hours\- When dosed as directed, midazolam does not delay awakening from general anesthesia.  
\- Recovery based on orientation and ambulation is around 2 hours but may take up to six hours in some cases.  
  
**Midazolam effects on the CNS:  
**\- Produces decreases in CMRO 2 and cerebral blood flow.\- Causes dose-related changes in regional cerebral blood flow in brain regions associated with the normal functioning of arousal, attention, and memory.  
\- Preserves cerebral vasomotor responsiveness to carbon dioxide during midazolam anesthesia.  
\- A potent anticonvulsant effective in the treatment of status epilepticus.  
  
**Anterograde amnesia:  
**\- The amnestic potency of benzodiazepines is more significant than their sedative effects resulting in a longer duration of amnesia than sedation.  
**\- Stored information (retrograde amnesia):** Is not altered by benzodiazepines.  
  
**Midazolam and ketamine:  
**\- When ketamine is administered alone, patients often become confused and disoriented or experience vivid dreams.  
\- The pre-administration of midazolam usually attenuates the incidence of postoperative delirium.  
\- Midazolam may also attenuate the hemodynamic pressor effects of ketamine.  
  
**Electroencephalogram with all benzodiazepines:**  
\- α activity is decreased  
\- Low-voltage rapid β activity is increased.  
\- Tolerance to the effects of benzodiazepines on the EEG does not occur.  
\- Midazolam is unable to produce an isoelectric EEG.  
\- However, propofol and barbiturates can produce an isoelectric EEG.  
  
**Midazolam and ICP:** No change\- Doses of 0.15 to 0.27 mg/kg IV show little or no change in ICP in patients with decreased intracranial compliance.  
**Midazolam effects on the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis:  
**\- Benzodiazepine-induced suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is supported by evidence of suppression of cortisol levels in treated patients.**  
Paradoxical excitement from midazolam:**  
\- Paradoxical excitement occurs in less than 1% of all patients receiving midazolam and is effectively treated with a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil.  
  
**Midazolam and ventilation:  
**\- Midazolam produces dose-dependent decreases in ventilation with 0.15 mg/kg IV, making effects similar to diazepam, 0.3 mg/kg IV.  
\- 0.05 mg/kg IV of midazolam produced no ventilatory depressant effects in healthy patients.  
\- When 2 mcg/kg of fentanyl was added, the combination may result in hypoxemia and/or hypoventilation.  
  
**Patients with COPD:**  
These patients experience a greater midazolam-induced depression of ventilation.  
  
**Transient apnea:  
**\- Large doses (> 0.15 mg/kg IV) may produce transient apnea, especially when the patient has received a narcotic.  
**\- Swallowing reflex:** Decreased  
**\- Upper airway activity:** Decreased  
**Cardiovascular effects:  
**\- An induction dose of 0.2 mg/kg IV will decrease systemic blood pressure (SVR) and increase heart rate more than diazepam, 0.5 mg/kg IV.  
\- Midazolam and its large dose used for induction are extremely rare (almost nonexistent).  
**Cardiac output:** No change  
**SVR:** Decreases  
**HR:** Increases (compensates for decreased SVR)  
**Cardiac output:** No change**Blocks sympathetic response to direct laryngoscopy:** No**  
  
Midazolam and renal clearance:  
**\- The elimination of half-time, V d , and midazolam clearance are not altered by renal failure.  
\- This is consistent with the extensive hepatic metabolism of midazolam.  
**  
Midazolam may inhibit platelet aggregation:  
**\- Benzodiazepines may inhibit platelet-activating factor-induced aggregation resulting in drug-induced inhibition of platelet aggregation.  
\- Midazolam-induced inhibition of platelet aggregation may reflect conformational changes in platelet membranes.  
\- However, benzodiazepines do not appear to affect the risk of hemorrhagic complications in patients with thrombocytopenia.  
\- The clinical significance of platelet aggregation-induced inhibition in the surgical arena is unclear.  
**Skeletal muscle relaxation with versed:  
**\- Due to the low amount of GABA-A receptors located in skeletal muscle, midazolam causes some muscle relaxation.\- However, muscle relaxation is not enough for surgical procedures and does NOT influence the required dose of neuromuscular blocking drugs.  
  
**Causes of synergistic sedative effects:  
**\- Concomitant use of barbiturates, alcohol, or other central nervous system depressants may increase the risk of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, desaturation, or apnea and may contribute to profound and/or prolonged drug effects.  
\- Narcotic premedication also depresses the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide stimulation.  
\- Alcohol  
**  
Contraindications of midazolam:  
**\- Hypersensitivity to versed  
\- Patients with acute narrow-angle glaucoma.  
\- Benzodiazepines may be used in patients with open-angle glaucoma only if they receive appropriate therapy.  
**\- Extreme caution:** Hypovolemia and shock  
  
**Drugs that may cause synergistic effects with midazolam:  
**CNS depressants  
Inhalation agents  
Anesthetics  
Opioids  
α 2 agonists  
**  
Caution with P450-3A4 enzyme inhibiting drugs.  
**\- Since midazolam is primarily metabolized in the liver and gut by the CYP3A4 enzyme, the concomitant administration of drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may prolong sedation due to a decrease in plasma clearance.  
**\- Note:** The P450-3A4 enzyme is responsible for the metabolism of more than 50% of medicines.  
**  
Drugs that inhibit the cytochrome P450-3A4 enzyme system:**  
Cimetidine  
Diltiazem  
Verapamil  
Protease inhibitors  
Antifungal agents  
Grapefruit juice  
Erythromycin  
  
\- Patients receiving drugs that induce the cytochrome P450-3A4 enzyme system may require larger doses of midazolam.  
**  
Drugs that induce the cytochrome P450-3A4 enzyme system:**  
Anticonvulsants (phenytoin and carbamazepine)  
Rifampin  
St. John’s Wart  
Glucocorticoids  
Barbiturates  
  
**Cancer and midazolam:  
**\- Patients with inflammation particularly elevated acute phase proteins such as C-reactive protein (CRP), have reduced CYP3A4 function.  
\- This is clinically relevant in cancer patients because tumors can be a source of systemically circulating cytokines.  
\- This may result in a decreased clearance of midazolam.**  
  
Women and midazolam:  
**\- Clinical studies indicate that women metabolize drugs that are substrates of CYP3A4 more quickly than men (20–30% increase).  
\- Analyses have shown around two-fold higher levels of CYP3A4 protein in females compared to male tissue samples.  
\- There lacks adequate literature on male vs female duration with midazolam.  
\- However, women tend to have a higher volume of distribution than men.  
  
**Midazolam and pregnancy:  
\- Teratogenic effects:** Controversial  
\- Data is controversial, resulting in anesthesia providers avoiding the administration of midazolam during pregnancy  
\- Refer to _“Midazolam (Versed) and Pregnancy”_ in this for more details.  
  
**Midazolam is classified by the US FDA with pregnancy as category D:**  
\- There is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans.  
\- There are no data on exposed pregnancies during the first two trimesters, and use during the third trimester could affect brain development.  
\- If midazolam is used during pregnancy, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.  
  
**Definition of category D:**  
\- Drugs that have caused are suspected of having caused or may be expected to cause an increased incidence of human fetal malformations or irreversible damage.  
\- These drugs may also have adverse pharmacological effects.  
\- Accompanying texts should be consulted for further details.  
  
**Midazolam and breastfeeding:**  
\- Small amounts of midazolam can get into breast milk after single intravenous (IV) doses.  
**\- Quick pharmacokinetic fact:** The absolute bioavailability of midazolam syrup in pediatric patients is only about 36%.  
\- When midazolam is administered as part of general anesthesia (including for c-section), or as a single dose, breastfeeding can be restarted as soon as the mother is ready to nurse (after any side effects, such as feelings of sleepiness, have passed).  
\- If more than one IV dose is administered during breastfeeding, watch the baby for sleepiness (hard to wake for feeding), low energy, or poor suckling.  
  
**Midazolam and** **dependence:  
**\- Benzodiazepines are intrinsically far less addicting than opioids, cocaine, amphetamines or barbiturates.  
\- Symptoms of dependence may occur after more than six months of use.  
  
**The onset of withdrawal symptoms:**  
**Short-acting benzodiazepines:** 1 to 2 days  
**Long-acting benzodiazepines:** Within 2 to 5 days  
**  
Withdrawal symptoms:**  
Irritability  
Insomnia  
Tremulousness  
  
**Common side-effects of midazolam:**  
\- Fatigue and drowsiness: Most common for chronic use.  
\- Hypoventilation and/or SaO2 when concomitantly administered with opioids or CNS depressants.  
\- Profound amnesia when combined with alcohol.**Documented adverse effects of midazolam (< 1%):** Normal dose**

**Integumentary:**  
\- Hive-like elevation at injection site.  
\- Swelling or feeling of burning, warmth, or coldness at the injection.  
  
**Antidote for midazolam and other benzodiazepines:** Flumazenil (Romazicon)**\- Flumazenil,** a specific benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist, is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and may be used in situations when an overdose with a benzodiazepine is known or suspected.  
\- The reversal of benzodiazepine effects may be associated with the onset of seizures in certain high-risk patients.\- Use with extreme caution in patients with a seizure history.  
  
**Pediatrics dosing:  
Midazolam syrup (2 mg/mL) pre-op sedation for peds:** PO  
**0.25 mg/kg PO:** Results in minimal effects on ventilation and oxygen saturation even when administered at doses as large as 1 mg/kg (maximum, 20 mg).  
  
**0.5 mg/kg PO:** When administered 30 minutes before induction of anesthesia, it provides reliable sedation and anxiolysis in children without producing delayed awakening.  
  
**Peds intranasal:**  
**Dose:** 0.2-0.3 mg/kg  
**Onset:** 3-5 mins  
**Peak:** 10-15 mins  
**Peds IM injection of midazolam:** Rare**Dose:** 0.1-0.15 mg/kg  
**Onset:** 3-5 mins  
**Peak:** 10-20 mins**Duration:** 30-60 minutes  
**  
Peds IV:**  
**Dose:** 0.05 mg/kg  
**Onset:** < 1 min  
**Peak:** 3-5 mins**  
  
Midazolam and neonates:  
**In reality, midazolam is rarely administered to neonates.  
  
**Rapid injection of midazolam should be avoided in the neonatal population.**  
\- The rapid IV administration of midazolam (less than 2 minutes) has been associated with severe hypotension in neonates, particularly when the patient has also received fentanyl.  
\- Severe hypotension has been observed in neonates receiving a continuous infusion of midazolam who receive a rapid intravenous injection of fentanyl.  
\- Seizures have been reported in several neonates following rapid intravenous administration.**  
Documented continuous infusion rate with neonates:**  
\- 0.03 mg/kg/hr (0.5 mcg/kg/min) in neonates < 32 weeks  
\- 0.06 mg/kg/hr (1 mcg/kg/min) in neonates > 32 weeks  
\- Intravenous loading doses should not be used in neonates.  
\- Due to an increased risk of apnea, extreme caution is advised when sedating preterm and former preterm patients who are not intubated.  
  
**Usage of midazolam in preterm infants and neonates:**  
\- Preterm infants and neonates lack or have very low levels of CYP3A4 enzymes, but appear to reach adult levels at around one year.  
\- Midazolam may result in profound and/or prolonged respiratory effects.  
  
**Pediatric patients > 1-year-old may require larger doses.**  
\- As a group, pediatric patients generally require higher dosages of midazolam (mg/kg) than adults.  
\- Younger (ages one to six years) may require higher dosages (mg/kg) than older pediatric patients and may require closer monitoring.  
  
**IV dose for 6 months to 5 years:**  
\- Initial dose 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg  
\- Total dose of up to 0.6 mg/kg may be necessary to reach the desired endpoint but usually does not exceed 6 mg.  
\- Prolonged sedation and the risk of hypoventilation may be associated with the higher doses.  
  
**IV dose for 6 to 12 years of age:  
**\- 1-2 mg is the most common preoperative dose for this group.  
\- The initial dose is 0.025 to 0.05 mg/kg; a total dose up to 0.4 mg/kg may be needed to reach the desired endpoint but usually does not exceed 10 mg.  
\- Prolonged sedation and the risk of hypoventilation may be associated with the higher doses.  
  
**IV dose for 12 to 16 years of age:  
**\- 1-2 mg is the most common preoperative dose.  
\- They should be dosed as adults.  
\- Prolonged sedation may be associated with higher doses; some patients in this age range will require higher than recommended adult doses, but the total amount usually does not exceed 10 mg.  
  
**Obese pediatric patients:**  
\- The dose should be calculated based on ideal body weight.  
\- When midazolam is given with opioids or other sedatives, the potential for respiratory depression, airway obstruction or hypoventilation is increased.  
\- The healthcare practitioner who uses this medication in pediatric patients should be aware of and follow accepted professional guidelines for pediatric sedation appropriate to their situation.  
  
**Adverse effects documented in pediatric patients: Normal dose (not bolused):**  
Desaturation  
Apnea  
Hypotension  
Paradoxical reactions  
Hiccough  
Seizure-like activity  
Nystagmus  
**Adult dosing for midazolam:  
\- Most common pre-op dose:** 2 mg IV  
**\- Most common pre-op range:** 1-5 mg IV  
**\- Documented pre-op recommended dose:** 0.01 to 0.05 mg/kg IV via slow injection or infusion over several minutes; the dose may be repeated in 10 to 15-minute intervals until sedation is achieved.  
**\- IV onset:** < 1 minute**\- Peak sedation:** 3-5 minutes  
**\- IV dose for > 60 years:** **IV:** 1 mg slow IV every 2 minutes as needed  
**\- Induction dose:** 0.1-0.2 mg/kg (rarely used for induction)  
**\- IV induction onset with pre-administration of a narcotic:** 1.5 minutes  
**\- IV induction onset without concurrent administration of narcotics:** 2 - 2.5 minutes  
**\- Doses for status epilepticus (seizure):** 0.2 mg/kg IM or intranasal or  
\- 5 mg (1 spray) intranasally in 1 nostril ONCE  
**\- Subsequent dose:** 5 mg (1 spray) intranasally in the opposite nostril after 10 minutes if the patient has not responded to the initial dose  
**\- Maximum dose:** 10 mg/day  
  
**Continuous IV infusion (rare):**  
\- Maintenance dose 1-7 mg/hour.  
or  
\- 0.06 to 0.12 mg/kg/hr (1 to 2 mcg/kg/min).  
\- The infusion rate can be increased or decreased (generally by 25% of the initial or subsequent infusion rate) as required, or supplemental intravenous doses of midazolam can be administered to increase or maintain the desired effect.  
  
**\- IM (< 60 years)** 0.07 to 0.08 mg/kg once, up to 1 hour before surgery  
**\- IM onset of sedation in adults:** 15 minutes  
**\- IM peak sedation:** 30-60 minutes  
**\- IV onset for peds and adult sedation:** 3 - 5 minutes  
\- Onset time is affected by the concurrent administration of narcotics.  
  
**Geriatric and debilitated patients:  
**\- Doses of midazolam should be decreased for elderly and for debilitated patients.  
**\-** Geriatric patients may have altered drug distribution and diminished hepatic and/or renal function.  
\- Patients over 70 years of age may be particularly sensitive.  
**  
Patients over 60 years of age:  
**\- Dosage reductions by 30% in recommended or when narcotics are given concomitantly or as a premedication  
  
**Patients over 70 years of age:  
**These patients may be susceptible.  
Many anesthesia providers avoid premedicating these patients with midazolam.  
**Debilitated patients:**  
Additional reductions of 60% of the recommended dose are appropriate for debilitated patients.Many anesthesia providers avoid premedicating these patients with midazolam.  
  
**Geriatrics pharmacokinetic notes:  
**\- Age-related changes in the liver have a major impact on hepatic clearance that in turn influences variability in response to medicines in older people\- A study showed that the plasma half-life was approximately doubled in the elderly.  
\- It may be further influenced by obesity, renal, cardiac, or hepatic conditions, and certain drugs that inhibit the P450-3A4 enzyme.\- The mean volume distribution based on total body weight increased consistently between 15% to 100% in the elderly.  
\- The mean clearance decreased by approximately 25% in the elderly in two studies and was similar to that of the younger patients.  
\- However, chronological age is a relatively poor predictor of hepatic clearance, and hence a detailed understanding of the factors that regulate drug clearance is needed.  
\- The impact of aging on drug metabolism also needs to be considered in the context of comorbid disease, frailty status, concomitant medicines, and genetics.  
**Debilitated patients:**  
\- Additional reductions of 60% of the recommended dose are appropriate for debilitated patients.  
  
**Adult continuous infusion in ICU for intubated patients:  
\- IV loading dose:** 0.05 to 0.2 mg/kg over at least 2 to 3 minutes can be used to establish the desired clinical effect in intubated patients.
