### CSE Indications and Contraindications

  
CSE:(Combined Spinal Epidural)  

**CSE Indications  
**A very uncomfortable parturient with an advanced dilatation (>7 cm) - quick onset  
A multiparous parturient at 4-5 cm with an anticipated delivery within a couple of hours or  
Anticipated difficult (prolonged) C-section  
Precipitous labor.  
  
Or for the fact that the combination of CSE and PCEA is the best approach to labor analgesia and decreased anesthesia manpower requirements.  
  
**Factors that may prolong the duration of a C-section**  
Patient with a history of multiple repeat sections-having excess scar tissue  
Added bilateral Tubal Ligation procedure  
A very slow surgeon or resident  
  
**Possible Indications for CSE**  
Patient who is having a precipitous delivery with possible tubal ligation  
C-section with potential complications such as placenta accreta  
C-section with multiple previous abdominal surgeries with suspected adhesions  
Patients with a history of chronic pain issues in which you suspect difficulties in controlling post-operative pain.  
  
**CSE Contraindications  
**Fetal distress  
Severe pre-eclampsia (controversial)  
Aortic stenosis  
Idiopathic pulmonary hypertension  
Severe cardiomyopathy  
Right to left cardiac shunts (a large drop in SVR will increase right to left shunting).  
  
Note that in some of those above contraindicated conditions, a straight epidural should perhaps be avoided too.  
  
**Fetal Distress  
**CSE should NOT be considered in situations of fetal distress (a threatening or ominous fetal heart tracing, thick meconium, etc.), in patients with fetal disease (cardiac for example), or premature infants. (BJOG 2002;109:274-81)
