### Heparin (Unfractionated Heparin)

_also view “Heparin_ – _Easy Review”_  
Also known as Unfractionated Heparin UFH)  
Do NOT confuse Heparin (UFH) with Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).  
Never administer any form of heparin IM.  
Heparin is an anticoagulant, but does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots.  
Heparin is naturally produced by basophils and mast cells.  
**Manufacture of Heparin:** Pig intestinal mucosa is currently the only approved raw material for production of _**heparin**_ marketed in most of the world, including the U.S.  
  
**Indications for Heparin**  
Atrial fibrillation with embolization:  
Treatment of acute and chronic consumption coagulopathies (disseminated intravascular coagulation).  
Prevention of clotting in arterial (vascular) and heart surgery.  
Prophylaxis and treatment of venous thrombosis.  
  
**Other indications:  
**Acute coronary syndrome, e.g., NSTEMI.  
Deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.  
Cardiopulmonary bypass for heart surgery.  
ECMO circuit for extracorporeal life support.  
Hemofiltration.  
  
**Mechanism of Action:**  
It binds to antithrombin III- which will inactivate other clotting factor(s).  
  
**Low doses:** Inactivates factor Xa, inhibits conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.  
**Higher doses:** Inactivates factors IX, X, XI, XII, thrombin, inhibits conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin; also inactivates activated Factor 8.  
  
**Antithrombin III.  
****Antithrombin III.** (ATIII) is a non-vitamin K dependent coagulation factor that INHIBITS coagulation by neutralizing the enzymatic activity of thrombin (factors IIa, IXa, Xa).  
  
This prevents the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.  
Heparin potentiates the activity of Antithrombin III by 2,000 times.  
Heparin acts at multiple sites in the normal coagulation system.  
Heparin binds with antithrombin III (heparin cofactor) and may inhibit thrombosis by inactivating activated Factor X and inhibiting the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.  
  
**Low Doses**  
Prevention of postoperative DVTs and pulmonary embolism in patients undergoing major abdomino-thoracic surgery or who for other reasons are at risk of developing thromboembolic disease.  
Prophylaxis and treatment of pulmonary embolism.  
Prophylaxis and treatment of peripheral arterial embolism.  
  
_Only 1/3 of an administered dose of heparin binds to antithrombin, and this fraction is responsible for most of its anticoagulant effect.  
_The remaining 2/3 has minimal anticoagulant activity at therapeutic concentrations.  
At high doses, both high- and low-affinity heparin catalyze the Antithrombin effect of a second plasma protein, heparin cofactor II.  
  
Heparin may also inhibit factors IX, X, XI, XII and plasmin.  
  
**Lower doses vs higher doses of heparins**  
**Lower dose:** Helps to prevent the start of clotting by inhibiting in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.  
**Example of low dose:** SQ 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours to prevent venous thromboembolic disease.  
  
**High doses** – **Boluses in the Cath lab and vascular cases:** Heparin will almost completely neutralize the prothrombin-to-thrombin chain conversion, as well as having a degrading effect on existing thrombin. Since thrombin is eliminated, the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin is also eliminated.  
  
**Risks of heparins  
**Undesired high levels of anticoagulation–can reverse with Protamine.  
Increased bleeding.  
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)–can use alternative anticoagulants.  
  
**Therapeutic Levels of Heparin**  
Therapeutic levels are recommended around 250-299 seconds (ACT results) during a PCI.  
200-250 seconds if used with a glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa medication.  
Pre-bypass: > 450 seconds.  
  
**Possible Monitoring for Heparin:** Low dose UFH administered subcutaneously 5,000 units.  
SQ 8-12 hours to prevent VTE, prolongs the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) only slightly, to just beyond the upper limit of the reference interval.  
aPTT.  
ACT.  
Anti-factor Xa.  
Platelet monitoring.  
Prolongs ACT and PTT (ACT > 150 seconds with high doses).  
Low range ACT used for cardiac cath labs.  
PT minimal change.  
Plasma recalcification time.  
Whole blood clotting time.  
Clotting time is prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, it is not measurably affected by low doses of heparin.  
Anti-Xa heparin assay provides a more sensitive measurement than the PTT.  
Platelet Count  
  
**Bleeding time** is usually unaffected by heparin.  
Infusion therapy is titrated with PTT and ACTs.  
Antifactor Xa.  
  
**Infusion therapy of Heparin:** is titrated with PTT and ACTs.  
**Antidote:** Protamine sulfate.  
  
**Dose for reversal:** 3-4 mg/kg or 1-3 mg/kg of protamine for each 100 units of heparin administered.  
Protamine comes in 10mg/ml vials.  
  
**For hearts:** common protamine dose is 20-30 ml (300-400 mg) push slowly.  
**Onset:  
IV:** Immediate**Sub Q:** 20-30 minutes.  
Peak plasma levels of heparin are achieved 2 to 4 hours following subcutaneous administration.  
**  
Clearance of Heparin depends on the dose.**  
**Lower doses:** Cleared rapidly from the plasma through saturable (cellular) mechanisms of clearance.  
  
**Therapeutic Doses:** Cleared by a combination of rapid saturable mechanism and a slower nonsaturable dose-independent mechanism of renal clearance.  
  
**Very high doses:** Cleared predominantly through the slower nonsaturable mechanism of clearance.  
  
LMWHs are cleared principally by the renal route, and their biological half-life is prolonged in patients with renal failure.  
  
**Half-Life Elimination**  
**Mean:** 1.5 hours  
**Range:** 1 to 2 hours; affected by obesity, renal function, malignancy, presence of pulmonary embolism, and infections.  
  
**IV Bolus:** half-life of **heparin** increases from ≈30 minutes after an **IV** bolus of 25 U/kg to 60 minutes with an **IV** bolus of 100 U/kg and 150 minutes with a bolus of 400 U/kg.  
  
**Low Doses**  
Prevention of postoperative DVT and pulmonary embolism in patients undergoing major abdomino-thoracic surgery or who for other reasons are at risk of developing thromboembolic disease.  
  
**About LMWH** (see Low Molecular Weight Heparin link)  
LMWH is too small to inactivate Thrombin and has only anti-factor Xa activity.  
LMWH is more predictable and expensive.  
_Neuraxial or deep regional block waiting times for heparin are determined by dose and route of administration._
