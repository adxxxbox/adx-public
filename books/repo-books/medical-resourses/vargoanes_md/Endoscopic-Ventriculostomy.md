Endoscopic Ventriculostomy (Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy-ETV)     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Endoscopic Ventriculostomy  
(Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy-ETV)

This procedure is simply an alternative to a shunt placement for the treatment of hydrocephalus.

The third and fourth ventricle are connected to each other by the narrow channel called the cerebral aqueduct (also called the Aqueduct of Sylvius). Aqueductal stenosis is when this channel becomes narrowed or blocked. This blockage causes ventricle volume to increase because the CSF cannot flow out of the ventricles and cannot be effectively absorbed by the surrounding tissue of the ventricles leading to hydrocephalus.

An ETV procedure involves the creation of a small hole in the front part of the third ventricle permitting the CSF to flow out of third ventricle, bypassing the obstructed aqueduct.

The surgeon basically drills a small hole through the cranium (like a burr hole). A pencil sized endoscopic device is carefully advanced down to the third ventricle creating a new pathway or dilating a present stenotic pathway for the flow of CSF.

**Anesthetic: General/ETT.**  
**Muscle Relaxant:** Preferred, patients need to be motionless.  
**Position:** Usually supine, arms tucked. Bed rotated 45 degrees. Make sure your ventilator tubing holder and tubing is away of the surgeon’s field. Head may be rotated-surgeon’s preference. Head is placed on either a donut or horseshoe device.  
Bed may be in slight reverse Trendelenburg.  
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 18g or good flowing 20g  
**A-line:** No  
**Neo Drip:** Consider it for older patients for being in slight reverse Trendelenburg. Not tucking the patient’s arm closest to you with (for better access) should be considered if you do not have a neo drip connected.

**Extubation:** Deep or awake

**Possible Complications:** Hemorrhage-rupture of the basilar artery while in the surgeon is scoping the prepontine cistern. If this happens, the only thing you could do is a massive blood transfusion and hope the artery clots off. This is extremely rare because the surgeon will carefully search identify the basilar artery before probing that area. But it has happened. A surgeon told me that himself.

Posthemorrhage  
Infection

**More Notes**  
You should always have quick IV access incase of a severe hemorrhage.
