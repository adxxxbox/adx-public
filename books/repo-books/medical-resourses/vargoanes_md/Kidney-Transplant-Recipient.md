Kidney Transplant Recipient     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Kidney Transplant Recipient

The donor kidney is from a brain dead cadaver or live donor.  
The kidney will be placed in the recipient’s iliac fossa in effort to restore renal function and thus maintain life in a patient with ESRD.  
No kidneys are removed; a functional kidney (kidney graft) is added.  
First the surgeon performs a venous anastomosis with the recipient’s external iliac vein. Then an arterial anastomosis is done with the external iliac artery. The donor ureter is connected into the recipient’s bladder. After three veins are then sewn (renal, gonadal and inferior phrenic), the kidney graft is now connected.

**The surgeon will ask you to give:**  
Lasix (1-1.5 mg/kg) over 15 minutes  
Mannitol (0.25-1gm/kg).  
Solu-Medrol: 1 gram (sometimes)  
 

**Pre-op**  
ABO/cross match  
A bunch of labs  
Immunosuppression MUST be started before going to the OR.  
Solu Medrol 500 mg IV over 15 minutes  
  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT, usually an RSI.  
These are ESRD patients so you need to be aware of their K+ level before using Anectine.  
**IV Access:** 18G in pre-op and a central line after induction  
**Line Access:** Central line after induction. Triple lumen is preferred for CVP.  
**PA Catheter:** usually not needed.  
**A-Line:** Not needed  
Obtain a baseline CVP. If the CVP < 12mmHg, some surgeons may ask for albumin.   
Chest X-Ray done in the OR to confirm line placement.  

**Fluids:** NS or LR is OK. Most facilities use NS.  
Limit crystalloid (NS) to 1-1.5 L  
Colloids for a CVP <12

**Foley Catheter:** Yes, you may be asked to clamp and unclamp as needed during the case. A 3-way Foley may be used for bladder irrigation. 

**Hemodynamic Goals:**  
Hypotension can lead to delayed graft function.  
CVP > 12 (record every 15 minutes)   
Many prefer a MAP between 90-110mmHg.  
Keep SBP 140-150  
Keep Hb >8gm/dL

**Drips:** Avoid vasopressors with alpha agonist. They can compromise blood flow to the transplanted organ  
No NEO and No Epi.  
Many prefer Dopamine with dose 5ug/kg/min 

**Muscle Relaxation:** TOF of 1 of 4. Nimbex is popular.  
Nimbex drip: Loading dose-0.1mg/kg  
Maintenance: 1-5mcg/kg/min

**Target post-operative parameters:**   
CVP 10-12   
SBP 140-150 and/or MAP > 70   
Hgb > 8   
 

**Other Notes**  
Surgeon may inject verapamil into the renal artery to prevent spasm, watch for side effects. 

Patients with DM- Monitor their blood sugar. Expect blood sugars to be labile due to NPO status and Solu- Medrol. 

Anemia: Many ESRD patients are anemic. Keep the Hb > 8.  
IV hydration will dilute the patient.  Make sure the patient has 2 units of PRBC available before case starts.

**Target post-operative parameters:**   
CVP 10-12   
SBP 140-150 and/or MAP > 70   
Hgb > 8   
We prefer isotonic crystalloid for boluses to achieve and maintain hemodynamic parameters. 

**Immunosuppression**

Most of these patients will receive ONE of immunosuppressants below.    
Depends on the surgeon. Follow their protocols.

**Thymoglobulin (1.5mg/kg)-** infuse through new central line over the next 6 hours.  **Campath (Alemtuzumab**) (30mg IV) -infuse over 4 hours. 

**Simulect (Basiliximab)** 20 mg IV over 30 minutes thru PIV 

**Side effects:**  
Bronchospasm  
Hypo/Hypertension  
Tachycardia  
Fever  
Rigor  
Rash  
Dyspnea
