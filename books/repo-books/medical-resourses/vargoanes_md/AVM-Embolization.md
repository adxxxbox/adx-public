### AVM Embolization and Anesthesia

**(Embolotherapy or Endovascular therapy)**  
  
These are fairly simple cases in which are simple general anesthesia cases located in an Interventional neuroradiology (INR) or endovascular neurosurgery room.  
Many of these INR suites are situated at some distance away from the operating theatre.  
  
The INR location makes it difficult for an expedient room set-up due to the lost time of transporting an anesthesia equipment cart and anesthesia machine to the room away from the operating room.  
Other inconveniences are working in reduced light, poor access to the patient, and concerns of ionizing radiation.  
  
The surgeon will then inject glue or other non-reactive liquid adhesive material into the AVM in order to block it off. For this purpose, a small catheter is passed through a groin vessel all the way up into the blood vessels supplying the AVM.  
The endovascular technique carries a risk of 3-5% for serious complications; however, it can make subsequent surgical removal of an AVM significantly safer, or can reduce the size of an AVM to a volume where radiosurgery carries a higher efficacy rate.  
  
**Note:** Unruptured AVMs are prone to rupturing.  
The smaller the AVMs, the greater the risk for hemorrhage because of high perfusion pressure inside the smaller AVMs.  
  
**Anesthetic considerations**  
Maintenance of patient immobility and physiological stability  
Manipulating systemic and regional blood flow  
Managing anticoagulation  
Treating sudden unexpected complications during the procedure.  
Consider anesthetic drugs that are advantageous for cerebral physiology and brain protection.  
  
**Pre-op  
**Evaluate for evidence of cerebral ischemia or elevated ICP.  
Any seizure medications, if any, should be administered preoperatively.  
  
**Anesthesia  
**These procedures can be MAC or general.  
Most facilities perform general anesthesia with complete muscle relaxation.  
Any patient movement during a cerebral wire-guided procedure may cause vascular perforation.  
  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT is most popular.  
  
**Blood pressure regulation:** Ask the interventionalist.  
Deliberate hypertension is common for occlusion and vasospasm.  
Hypotension is recommended to slow blood flow in the feeding artery of an AVM before glue injection.  
  
**LMA:** As an alternative to endotracheal intubation for the management of the airway. It allows airway control with less hemodynamic stress and for a smooth emergence from anesthesia. Muscle relaxation and controlled ventilation can be achieved with the LMA provided there is appropriate patient selection.  
**Induction:** If there is concern for vascular leak or rupture, the sympathetic system should be blunted during laryngoscopy and intubation with lidocaine and esmolol as needed.  
Note: Although, AVM’s are not likely to rupture during induction  
  
**Relaxation:** Yes, zero movement is preferred.  
  
**Ventilation:** Patient with elevated ICP should be hyperventilated to decrease ICP and enhance quality of angiogram and surgical exposure.  
  
**Inhalation agent:** Isoflurane is preferred.  
  
**Nitrous oxide:** Preferably avoided, as there is risk of enlargement of micro air bubbles during injection of contrast or irrigation fluid.  
  
**A-line:** Yes, ACTs will be needed with lab draws.  
If arterial cannulation is difficult, then a side port of the femoral artery introducer sheath can be used to monitor the arterial pressure  
  
**IV Access:** 1-2  
  
**IV Fluids:** Hypotonic and glucose-containing solutions should be avoided.  
Glucose containing solutions could exacerbate cerebral edema.  
  
**Foley:** Yes  
  
**Position:** Supine, arms tucked.  
There should be sufficient slack in all monitoring lines, i.v. lines, and airway connections as the patient table may need to move back and forth during imaging and coiling.  
  
**Warming blanket:** These patients are prone to hypothermia in the neuroradiology suites.  
Measures should be taken to keep the body temperature near normal and core temperature measured.  
  
**Duration:** usually 1-3 hours, could be longer.  
  
**Coagulation disorders.** Baseline coagulation tests are usually ordered.  
Patient will require heparin and ACT monitoring.  
  
**Protamine:** _Always have a syringe of protamine available. If a cerebral bleed occurs, you will be asked to reverse the heparin ASAP.  
The rapidity with which heparin is reversed is directly proportional to the good outcome from a head bleed._  
**  
Fluid management  
**Be aware that the interventionalist will be administering volume of heparinized flush solution and radiographic contrast. Diuretics such as mannitol and furosemide may be required intraoperatively.  
  
**EBL:** Minimal  
  
**Emergence  
**Prompt awakening at the end of the procedure is helpful when performing a neurological evaluation of the patient.  
Blood pressure control may still be necessary during emergence.  
_The catastrophes during embolization of AVMs can be rapid and dramatic and that needs urgent and planned attention._  
  
**Possible Complications:**  
Brain hyperemia: Most feared specific AVM complication brain hyperemia that can manifest as edema or hemorrhage.  
  
**An occlusive problem:** Ask the interventionalist for a desired blood pressure.  
Blood pressure should be augmented with or without direct thrombolysis to increase distal perfusion  
**  
Hemorrhage from the AVM  
**Hemorrhage is often accompanied by an abrupt rise in mean arterial pressure.  
The blood pressure should be immediately reduced by increasing the inhalation agent, starting a Cardene or nipride infusion.  
Immediate reversal of heparin may be required (1 mg protamine for each 100 units of heparin given) and lowering of the systemic arterial pressure.  
Ask the interventionalist for the desired blood pressure.  
_P_ aCO 2 should be maintained between 45 and 50 and mannitol (0.25–0.5 g kg) −1 )may be given to reduce cerebral edema.  
Aneurysm perforation is usually treated by packing the defect with coils. Emergency craniotomy and clipping of aneurysm may be required if coiling fails. Patients may develop acute hydrocephalus secondary to new SAH necessitating transfer to theatre, for ventricular drainage.  
Adverse reaction from contrast medium: allergic reaction or osmotic load that further aggravates CCF.  
Subarachnoid hemorrhage from a concomitant aneurysm  
Stroke  
Death  
Visual disturbances  
Transient neurologic deficits  
Cerebral edema  
Hyperemic complication  
  
**MAC case complication:**  
Intubate and secure the airway. Control ventilation and muscle relaxation is suggested.  
This will also prevent a seizure.  
  
**Post-op BP**  
Maintenance of modest hypotension is usually required post AVM embolization to prevent cerebral edema and hemorrhage. The mean arterial pressure should be kept 15–20% below the baseline for 24 hours.  
  
Patient must remain flat on their back for at least 6 hours after the procedure.  
Patient is sent back to the neuro ICU for observation.
