Cesarean Section Review     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Cesarean Section Review

The 2nd most frequently performed major surgical operation in the US.

C-Sections are performed whenever abnormal conditions complicate labor and vaginal delivery, threatening the life or health of the mother or the baby.

When the umbilical cord is clamped and cut, start 20 units of Pitocin (in a 1 liter LR IV Bag) wide open. Some of us just inject 20 units into the existing LR bag as long as it is at least half full.  
Follow up with 20 more units of Pitocin in another 1 liter bag at a slower rate.  
  
Roughly 33% percent of pregnant women now give birth through a caesarean section rather than natural birth.

The placenta is removed and the uterus and abdomen will be stitched closed (outer layer may be stapled).  

**Boggy Uterus after delivery (bleeding)**  
MD will request you to add 10-20 more units of Pitocin in the present infusing bag.  
0.2mg Methergine IM (optional)  
250mcg Hemabate IM  (optional)

Only administer per surgeon requests.  
  
**Failed Regional**  
First differentiate pressure with pain  
Pain: You can administer Ketamine 10-20mg bolus. Re-dose with 10mg as needed.  
Patient is belligerent: Ketamine as above.   
We rarely put the patient to sleep for the above.

**EBL:** Most of the time we document 500mLs or 1 liter. Ask the surgeon.

**VBAC** (vaginal birth after cesarean)  
VBAC is an option for women who have had previous C-sections and are interested in a TOL. Success rate from prior C-section with low transverse uterine incision is 70%.

**TOL** (trial of labor) The most severe risk associated with TOL is uterine rupture

0.2–1.5% of attempted VBACs among women with a low transverse uterine scar will     
 end in uterine rupture.  
**Risks**  
C-Section-The maternal death rate: <  0.02%, 4x more than a vaginal delivery.   
Complications: < 10% of cases.  

**Morbidity and mortality rates**  
Surgical injuries to the ureter or bowel: 0.1%.   
Incisional infection: 2.5-15%  
UTI: 2-16%  
DVTs: risk is 3-5 x > than vaginal.  
  
**Most common reason for C-section:** Previous C-section

**GI Prophylaxis**  
Because of the possibility of the need of general anesthesia, all pregnant women should take proton pump inhibitors in the peri-labor period.  
Pepcid 20mg IV  
Bicitrate 30mL

**Incisions (Vertical vs Low Transverse)**  
**Vertical Incision:**  
In the olden days, vertical incisions were used for C-sections. They required repeat C-sections because the scar was weak with a risk of rupturing in subsequent attempted VBACs. 

**Low Transverse Incision:**  
Today, the incision is almost always made horizontally across the lower end of the uterus.  
Less EBL and a decreased chance of rupture.  
Allows VBAC.

**Other reasons for C-section**  
Non-progressive labor (dystocia) 30%  
Cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD)- head too big 12%.  
Breech 12% (3% in all births)  
Fetal distress 9%  
Remaining 14% from serious factors: placenta previa and placental abruption.

**Possible co-existing conditions**  
Maternal diabetes  
Hypertension (pre-eclampsia)  
Malignancies of the genital tract  
Preeclampsia

**Reasons for GENERAL anesthesia**  
Severe fetal distress  
Coagulation disorder  
Failed regional  

**Types of C-sections**  
**Unplanned C-Sections:** Performed once labor has  
started due to unexpected labor complications.

**Emergency C-Sections:** During the process of labor and swift action is required to prevent the deaths of mother, fetus or both.

**Planned C-Section (or elective/scheduled):** Arranged ahead of time, is most commonly arranged for medical reasons and ideally as close to the due date as possible.

A repeat C-section is one that is done when a patient had a previous Caesarean section. Typically it is performed through the old scar.
