### Epidural Complications and Treatment

1.  **Difficulty threading catheter:**
    -   NEVER withdraw a catheter from a needle once it has exited the needle tip for fear of possible shearing.
    -   Have patient take a deep breath as you advance the catheter.
    -   Add an additional 4-5 ml saline into space.
    -   Decrease the angle of insertion by pulling the hub caudad.
    -   Withdraw the needle 1-2 cm and try to advance again.
    -   If unsuccessful, withdraw needle and catheter together and attempt at another interspace.
2.  **Unintentional intravascular injection:**
    -   Early detection is paramount.
    -   Blood is often seen immediately in the epidural needle hub or the catheter once threaded.
    -   Always aspirate before injecting your test dose. (If intravenous, blood is often, but not always, detected prior to injecting the test dose.) Also, place the operator end of the catheter below the injection site and check for gravity flow of blood or CSF. (Aspiration may close a small vessel or entrain tissue into the orifice and block the flow of blood.)
    -   If the catheter is intravascular an increase in heart rate (20-30bpm) will be seen within the first minute.
    -   Remove the catheter and attempt replacement at another interspace.
    -   Pt may also describe tinnitus, metallic taste, circumoral numbness or altered hearing.
3.  **Unintentional injection of toxic doses of local anesthetic:  
    **(it can happen with catheter migration after an initial negative test dose)
    -   Seizure and cardiovascular collapse may be seen with toxic doses of lidocaine or chloroprocaine. Be prepared to treat seizure activity. Benzodiazepines are the treatment of choice and small doses of propofol may be beneficial, but consider the risk of potentiating cardiovascular collapse.
    -   Be prepared to maintain the patient’s airway and oxygenation. Consider endotracheal intubation with succinylcholine and cricoid pressure.
    -   With severe reactions, cardiovascular support may be needed. Consider intravascular fluids and vasopressors such as dopamine.
    -   Prepare for lipid rescue (injection / infusion of intralipid).

4.  **Hypotension:** (defined as 20-30% decrease in blood pressure or symptomatic decrease in blood pressure usually presented as nausea and vomiting)
    -   This is due to the sympathetic blockade and arterial and venous dilation.
    -   Consider a co-load of 500ml IV fluids while placing epidural as a preventive measure.
    -   Left uterine displacement. (hypotension is accentuated by aortocaval compression and an upright/semi-upright position)
    -   Supplemental O2.
    -   If heart rate <70- treat with ephedrine 5-15mg. If heart rate >70- treat with phenylephrine 50-100mcg. Incremental doses
5.  **Unintentional intrathecal injection or catheter placement:** ( **WET TAP)**
    -   If dural puncture is noted prior to catheter placement and test dose, don’t worry! You have options here!
        1.  Remove the epidural needle and attempt placement at a different interspace.
        2.  Thread the catheter into the intrathecal space and set the pump at 1/10 th the rate of your epidural rate. (ex: if you planned to run epidural at 12ml/hr you may run it intrathecally at 1.2ml/hr). In this case, be sure to LABEL LABEL LABEL! Label your pump, tubing and even consider a sign over patient’s bed. Stay with patient to confirm level and adjust rate as needed and EDUCATE the nursing staff!
    -   If dural puncture is noted on test dose, spinal anesthesia will be noted within 3 minutes. In this case the patient should be placed supine with left uterine displacement and slight head elevation to avoid cephalad spread.
    -   If a high spinal with diaphragm paralysis is seen, be prepared for intubation and respiratory support.
6.  **Inadequate block/ Patchy block/ One sided block:**
    -   Reposition the patient to enable spread of local anesthesia to unblocked area with unblocked area dependent.
    -   Rebolus epidural if needed with repositioning.
    -   Reposition catheter. If the catheter is positioned to one side you may be able to adjust it by simply withdrawing the catheter 1-2cm (if you have enough catheter in the space).
    -   If none of these techniques has improved the block remove the catheter and replace at another interspace if the patient consents.
7.  **Post Dural Puncture Headache (PDPH):**  
    (more common during epidural needle placement due to the large diameter of the needle).
    -   Bed rest, hydration and oral analgesic.
    -   IV administration of caffeine (500mg)
    -   Severe cases: epidural blood patch using 15-20ml autologous blood. Immediate relief is usually seen.
    -   NOTE: prophylactic epidural blood patch after known dural puncture is not generally recommended.  
        **_NOTE_** : **_Timing of blood patch is not a simple issue._**
8.  **Subdural hematoma:** 
    -   Very rare, but could potentially happen after trauma to epidural blood vessels.
    -   S/S - severe backache, neurological deficits persisting after epidural discontinued, bladder dysfunction, tenderness over spinous area and unexplained fever.
    -   Surgical neurology consult immediately for surgical evacuation of hematoma and prevention of permanent deficits.
