### Anterior Spinal Artery Syndrome (ASAS)

_(The areas of the spinal cord that are most vulnerable to deprivation of blood supply are T1–3, T5 and L1)  
_**ASAS** also also known as "anterior spinal artery syndrome" is the most common cause of spinal cord infarction.  
It is a medical condition where blood flow from the anterior spinal artery is interrupted, causing ischemia or infarction of the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord. It is characterized by loss of motor function below the level of injury, loss of sensations carried by the anterior columns of the spinal cord (pain and temperature), and preservation of sensations carried by the posterior columns (fine touch, vibration and proprioception). Proprioception is the body's ability to sense movement within joints and joint position.  
  
**Anterior Spinal Artery Syndrome (ASAS) can occur from:**  
Any surgical procedure **(prolonged aortic clamping)**  
Trauma ( **AAA** )  
**Vascular malformations** that impairs the artery of Adamkiewicz  
**In bronchial artery embolization** (for treatment of massive hemoptysis) one of the most serious complications is inadvertent occlusion or embolization of the artery of Adamkiewicz. This may only occur when the artery of Adamkiewicz originates from the intercostobronchial trunk (ICBT). It has been suggested that medullary spinal arteries will arise from the intercostal branch of the right ICBT in 5%–10% of individuals. Unintentional embolization of the smaller radicular arteries does not cause clinical problems like spinal cord ischemia.  
  
**Manifestations of ASAS:**  
Flaccid paralysis of the lower extremities  
Loss of urinary and fecal continence  
Impaired motor function of the legs  
Sensory function is often preserved to a degree  
  
**Risk of paralysis related to ASAS  
**0.2% in elective infra-renal AAA repair  
8% in elective thoracic aneurysm repair  
40% in the setting of dissection or rupture involving the thoracic cord.  
The duration of cord clamping is a key determinant of the risk of paraplegia.
