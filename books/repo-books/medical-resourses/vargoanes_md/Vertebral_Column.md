### Vertebral Column

Vena caval compression results in distension of the epidural venous plexus, increasing the risk of intravascular injection during regional blockade.  
The capacity of the epidural space is reduced, which probably contributes to the enhanced spread of local anesthetics in pregnancy.  
The volume of epidural fat and veins enlarge during pregnancy.  
Spinal CSF volume is reduced due to compression from the epidural veins in the epidural space.  
(This is one reason neuraxial doses are smaller than nonpregnant patients)  
  
**Epidural Pressure  
**Epidural pressure is usually negative.  
Full term patient in lateral position, epidural pressure becomes positive.  
Full term patient in supine position, epidural pressure increases.  
Epidural pressure increases during labor.  
Epidural pressure returns to a nonpregnant level by 6-12 hours postpartum.  
  
**CSF Pressure**  
CSF pressure during pregnancy remains the same (some literature states that the CSF pressure is increased from the compression from the epidural veins in the epidural space).  
CSF pressure increases during an epidural bolus.  
CSF pressure increases during uterine contractions due to acute increases in epidural vein distention.  
  
Between contractions the pressure may be around 28 mm Hg, but during painful contractions it may rise to as much as 70mmHg.  
  
**Why we insert an epidural or spinal needle BETWEEN contractions**  
Between contractions the CSF pressure may be around 28mmHg but during painful contractions it may rise to as much as 70mmHg.  
It is safer not to advance an epidural or spinal needle during contractions for risk of puncturing the dura and expulsion of CSF at high pressure.  
  
**CSF Constituents**  
CSF constituents remain the same during pregnancy.
