Cerebral Palsy Review   

### Cerebral Palsy Review

**_By Chris Baird, CRNA_**

Cerebral palsy is a group of nonprogressive motor impairment syndromes secondary to lesions or anomalies of the brain that is more a symptom complex than an actual disease. These lesions can arise from antenatal, perinatal or postnatal period.

CP patients are at increased risk of Latex allergy due to repeated catheterization.  
  
**Incidence and identification:**  
1 in every 500 live births  
Lesions can be identified by MRI results  
There is no gold standard for diagnosis

**Classifications:**  
Cerebral palsy is classified by the extremity involved and the characteristics of the neurological dysfunction.  
  
**Depending on the extremity it may be classified as:**  
Monoplegia  
Hemiplegia  
Diplegia  
Quadraplegia  
  
**Depending on the characteristics it may be classified as:  
**Spastic  
Hypotonic  
Dystonic  
Athetotic

Most common classification is bilateral spastic CP.  
**Spastic** (70% of cases) - Lesions of the cerebrum.

A patient with spastic diplegia has normal intellect

Patients with spastic diplegia and spastic hemiplegia have the best prognosis for functional improvement  
  
With spastic hemiplegia, the upper extremities are affected more than the lower extremity. However, spastic quadriplegia involves multiple central nervous system insults with accompanying severe neurological dysfunction and disability.

The number of extremities affected has been shown to correlate with level of intelligence.

Dyskinetic (10% of cases)- Lesion of basal ganglia. Includes dystonia (twisting of torso), athetosis (purposeless movements of extremities), and chorea (quick, jerky proximal movements of extremities).

Ataxic (10% of cases)- Lesion of cerebellum. Includes tremor, loss of balance and speech.

Mixed (10% of cases)- Lesion of cerebrum and cerebellum. Includes spastic and athetoid movements.

**Signs and Symptoms:**  
Most common - spasticity  
Neurological  
Respiratory  
GI  
Musculoskeletal  
Fixed flexion and contractions  
Urological function problems - incontinent from neuropathic bladder  
Mental retardation  
Speech defects

**Treatments seen for CP:  
**Elective orthopedic procedures  
Antireflux operations  
Botox injections  
Selective dorsal rhizotomy  
Intrathecal baclofen pump insertions  
Physical and occupational therapy  
Antiseizure medications.

**Orthopedic -** Repairing the results from prolonged increased muscle tone and spasticity:  
Muscle and joint contractures  
Deformities of the feet and extremity long bones  
Scoliosis  
**  
Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR)  
**A neurosurgical treatment to reduce spasticity

**Baclofen Pump (ITB)  
**The most recent surgical advance-an intrathecal pump

**Other surgical procedures we see with CP**  
Tracheostomy  
Feeding gastrostomy

Fundoplication-for severe GERD

Submandibular duct relocation –To reduce drooling

Bladder augmentation (cystoplasty) **-** for incontinence and other bladder

Diagnostic esophagoscopy or gastroscopy  
Dental restorations and extractions  
Corrective spinal surgery (for scoliosis)  
Selective dorsal rhizotomy (relief of spasticity)  
Corrective orthopedic procedures (tendon lengthening, contracture releases)  
  
**Hearing Correction Surgery  
**Ear blockages or infections contribute to conductive loss but treatable meds.  
CP patients are prone to nerve or sensorineural hearing loss due to nerve fiber defects within the inner ear or in the nerve pathway of the brain that can affect hearing higher, rather than lower, tones.

**Hearing aids** – amplify sounds without distortion.

**Radio aides** – the use of microphone and transmitters

**Orthopedic Surgery**  
Whether paresis (weakened) or plegia (paralyzed), the damaged brain affects muscles and the ability to control them.

**Orthopedic procedures  
**The most common surgical procedure performed by hand surgeons in cerebral palsy for thumb-in-palm deformity is release of the adductor pollicis muscle from the middle metacarpal origin, with additional release of the thenar muscles or flexor pollicis longus, as indicated, to decrease the flexion adduction forces across the first ray.

**Surgery is often used to optimize potential for:**  
Movement  
Balance  
Coordination

**Vision Correction Surgery**  
It is common in children with cerebral palsy to have a vision impairment or vision loss.

Some common vision challenges in individuals with cerebral palsy, include:  
**Cortical blindness** – partial, temporary, or complete eye loss due to damage to the occipital cortex, the brain’s visual center  
**Hemianopia** – loss of half the visual field (either right or left) often due to damage to the primary visual cortex  
  
**Strabismus** – misalignment of both eyes, due to imbalance of the eye muscles.  
**Long term muscle spasticity in chest may cause:  
**Scoliosis  
Restrictive lung defects  
Pulmonary hypertension  
Respiratory failure  
Cor pulmonale  
  
The above may increase the risk of aspiration pneumonitis and lung scarring from GI complications  
  
Consequentially CP patients are at increased risk of Latex allergy due to repeated catheterization. Seizure disorders are common in cerebral palsy patients and there is argument that the two diseases share some commonality.  
  
Antiseizure medications can lead to gingival hyperplasia, megaloblastic anemia, and altered responses to drugs metabolized by the liver.

**Factors associated with Cerebral Palsy:**  
\- Pre-pregnancy  
   o Long menstrual cycles  
   o History of fetal wastage  
\- During Pregnancy  
   o Low social class  
   o Congenital malformations  
   o Fetal growth retardation  
   o Twin gestation  
   o Abnormal fetal presentation  
\- During Labor and delivery  
   o Premature separation of placenta  
\- Early postnatal period  
   o Newborn encephalopathy

**Treatments:**  
These patients generally have elective orthopedic procedures, antireflux operations, botox injections, selective dorsal rhizotomy, and intrathecal baclofen pump implantation. Noninvasive options are physical and occupational therapy as well as antiseizure medications.
