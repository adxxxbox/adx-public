### Desirudin (Iprivask) Reversal

_Currently, there is a lack of specific antidotes for the growing number of new (novel) anticoagulants that are slowly replacing warfarin and heparin. For this reason, there is NO universal standard of care for the treatment of the anticoagulated bleeding patient when there is no specific antidote._

**Consult cardiology for ALL patients with coronary stents.**  
  
**Quick Notes  
**Direct thrombin inhibitor with a very SHORT half-life.  
**T1/2:** just 35-40 minutes  
**For severe renal impairment:** **_T1/2 is_** _prolonged up to 12 hours instead of the normal 2-4 hours_  
aPTT normally returns to normal just 2–4 hours following discontinuation.  
  
**Specific antidote:** None  
  
**Lab Monitoring**  
**Thrombin Time (TT)** is the most reliable  
**aPTT:** commonly used.  
**ECT**  
  
**Initial Treatment:  
**Discontinue  
  
**Urgent (Not Bleeding)  
Remember:** very short half-life  
Discontinue  
Draw labs  
  
**Optional documented treatments**  
**Desmopressin**  
Desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg IV administered over 15 minutes- reduced the anticoagulant (aPTT) effects of desirudin infused at doses of 0.2 and 0.3 mg/kg/hour by about 25%, without affecting the plasma pharmacokinetics of Desirudin.  
  
**Hemodialysis:** Desirudin can be cleared via hemodialysis with the use of special dialysis membranes.  
  
**Tranexamic Acid:** Not enough literature.  
  
**Recombinant factor VIIa not established.**  
While recombinant factor VIIa has been shown to reduce bleeding induced by DTIs in healthy volunteers, its clinical utility has not been established.  
  
**Life-threatening**  
Initiate massive transfusion protocols.  
FEIBA 8 to 25 units/kg or Kcentra can be considered.  
  
**_Warning:_** _Thrombotic and thromboembolic events may occur with high doses of PCCs and may result in death. Patients need to be monitored following administration._
