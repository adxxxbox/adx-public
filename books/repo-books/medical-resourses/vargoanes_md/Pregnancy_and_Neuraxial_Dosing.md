### Pregnancy and Neuraxial Dosing

We administer less local anesthetics with pregnant women.  
  
Spread and depth of epidural and spinal anesthesia in greater in the parturient when compared to the non-parturient.  
  
Increased spread of local anesthetic has been found to occur as early as the first trimester.  
  
There is a correlation between progesterone levels and the mg per segment requirement for lidocaine.  
  
The dose of local anesthetics should be reduced for any parturient, regardless of the stage of pregnancy.  
  
Hormonal changes enhance the potency of local anesthetics.  
  
Mechanical factors add to the risk. Epidural veins are dilated, decreasing the volume in the epidural and subarachnoid space… plays a minor role.
