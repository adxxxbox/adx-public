### Mivacron (Mivacurium Chloride)

A Benzyl isoquinoline derivative  
  
Mivacron is a short-acting, nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant that usually does not require reversal.  
  
**Unique Consideration:** Substantial histamine release and hypotension with rapid administration.  
  
**Short story:**  
Mivacron is a short-acting neuromuscular blocking agent that usually does not need reversal.  
It was widely used at one time, but a manufacturing issue occurred and it was taken off the market in 2006.  
Mivacron was popular for short cases; direct and rigid laryngoscopy, laparoscopic appendectomy and cholecystectomy.  
It is now becoming available again in the US.  
  
**Clinical Pharmacology**  
Mivacron (a mixture of three stereoisomers) binds competitively to cholinergic receptors on the motor end-plate to antagonize the action of acetylcholine, resulting in a block of neuromuscular transmission. Unlike other non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers, the action is antagonized by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine.  
Having ten methoxy (-OCH 3 ) groups, Mivacron is a more potent neuromuscular blocking drug than atracurium, which has eight such groups, but is less potent than doxacurium, which has twelve.  
  
**Mivacron and histamine release  
**The histamine release caused by Mivacron is equal to atracurium.  
Profound histamine release resulting in hypotension is associated with rapid administration.  
Consequent cardiovascular effects can be minimized by a slow injection over 1 minute.  
  
**Concentration:** 2mg/ml  
**Intubation Dose:** 0.15-0.25 mg/kg**Common Adult dose:** 0.2mg/kg most common.  
20-30 mg slow IV injection for induction should provide adequate relaxation for 20-30 minute procedures without requiring reversal.  
**Maintenance dose for additional neuromuscular blockade:** 0.1 mg/kg over 5-15 seconds will deliver 15 more minutes of an effective neuromuscular block without accumulation.  
**Common maintenance dose:** 5-10mg.  
**  
Package insert doses**  
0.1 mg/kg administered over 5-15 seconds delivers approximately 15 minutes of a clinically effective neuromuscular block.  
0.2 mg/kg administered over 30 seconds delivers approximately 20 minutes of a clinically effective neuromuscular block.  
  
**Dose warning:** Higher doses of greater than or equal to 0.2 mg/kg (greater than or equal to 3 x ED95) may cause histamine release. This may be associated with transient decreases in MAP and increases in HR lasting 1-3 minutes in some patients.  
  
**Note:** Volatile anesthetics may prolong the duration of action; the magnitude of these effects may be increased as the concentration of the volatile agent is increased.  
Repeated administration of maintenance doses or continuous infusion of Mivacron for up to 2.5 hours is not associated with development of tachyphylaxis or cumulative neuromuscular blocking effects in ASA Physical Status I-II patients.  
  
**Renal and liver impairment:** 0.15 mg/kg  
Duration of block may be about 1.5 times longer in patients with end-stage kidney disease and about 3 times longer in patients with end-stage liver disease.  
  
**Asthma and cardiac disease**  
In patients with clinically significant cardiac disease, asthma, or history of greater sensitivity to histamine release or other mediators, use a lower initial Mivacron dose and inject over longer duration.  
  
**Adults with reduced plasma cholinesterase activity**  
0.15 mg/kg or less IV over 5 to 15 seconds in patients who are heterozygous for atypical pseudocholinesterase. The clinically effective block duration may be about 10 minutes longer than in patients with the normal genotype.  
Use ideal body weight to determine dose for patients weighing in excess of 30% more than their ideal body weight. Avoid use in patients known to be homozygous for the atypical plasma cholinesterase gene.  
  
**Pediatric Dosing**  
**Children 2-12 years**  
0.2 mg/kg over 5-15 seconds will deliver approximately 10 minutes of a clinically effective neuromuscular block.  
In children (2 to 12 years), Mivacron has a higher ED95 (0.1 mg/kg), faster onset, and shorter duration of action than in adults.  
The mean time for spontaneous recovery of the twitch response from 25% to 75% of control amplitude is about 5 minutes (n = 4) following an initial dose of 0.2 mg/kg Mivacron.  
Recovery following reversal is faster in children than in adults.  
  
**Adolescents with reduced plasma cholinesterase activity**  
0.15 mg/kg or less IV over 5 to 15 seconds in patients heterozygous for atypical pseudocholinesterase; the clinically effective block duration may be about 10 minutes longer than in patients with the normal genotype. Use ideal body weight in patients whose weight exceeds 130% of their ideal body weight.  
  
**Infusion Doses:**  
Mivacron may be diluted to a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL in 0.9% sodium chloride, lactated ringer's and dextrose containing solutions.  
Mivacron infusion rate of 8 to 10 micrograms/kg/min (0.5 to 0.6 mg/kg/hr) is recommended.  
  
**Onset:** 2-3 minutes  
**Duration:** 20 minutes  
Clinically effective duration is one-third to one-half that of intermediate-acting agents and 2 to 2.5 times that of succinylcholine.  
The mean time for spontaneous recovery of the twitch response from 25% to 75% of control amplitude is about 6 minutes (range: 3 to 9 minutes, n = 32) following an initial dose of 0.15 mg/kg Mivacron and 7 to 8 minutes (range: 4 to 24 minutes, n = 85) following initial doses of 0.2 or 0.25 mg/kg Mivacron.  
  
**Distribution:** The volume of distribution is small.  
**Protein binding:** Has not been determined due to rapid hydrolysis of by plasma cholinesterase.  
**ED95:** 0.07 mg/kg  
**Metabolism:** Unlike other non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers, it is metabolized by plasma cholinesterase. Metabolism can therefore be very slow in people with pseudocholinesterase deficiency, resulting in prolonged paralysis. The same problem exists with the depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent succinylcholine.  
  
**Metabolites:** A quaternary alcohol and a quaternary monoester metabolite and are not active.  
  
**Elimination:** Renal and biliary excretion of unchanged Mivacron are minor elimination pathways; urine and bile are important elimination pathways for the two metabolites.  
  
**Shelf-life:** 18 months and stored at room temperature.  
  
**Plasma cholinesterase deficiency or prolonged block is associated with:**  
Genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase  
Pregnancy  
Liver disease  
Malignant tumors  
Infections  
Burns  
Organophosphate exposure (e.g. certain insecticides)  
  
**Adverse events:**  
Skin flushing or redness (16%).  
Hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmia, phlebitis < 1%.  
Bronchospasm, wheezing and/or hypoxemia < 1%.  
Rash, urticaria, erythema, injection site reaction < 1%.  
Prolonged drug effect.  
  
**Causes of potentiation of neuromuscular block:**  
Neuromuscular disease  
Burns  
Acid-base balance and / or serum electrolyte abnormalities  
Cachexia  
Debilitation  
Carcinomatosis  
  
**Possible causes of resistance:**  
Burns  
Acid-base balance and / or serum electrolyte abnormalities.  
Chronic administration of phenytoin or carbamazepine.  
  
**Transient decreases in MAP and increases in HR:**  
Higher doses of greater than or equal to 0.2 mg/kg (greater than or equal to 3 x ED95) may be associated with transient decreases in MAP and increases in HR in some patients.  
  
These decreases in MAP are usually maximal within 1 to 3 minutes following the dose, typically resolve without treatment in an additional 1 to 3 minutes, and are usually associated with increases in plasma histamine concentration.  
  
The average ED95 (dose required to produce 95% suppression of the adductor pollicis muscle twitch response to ulnar nerve stimulation) of Mivacron is 0.07 mg/kg (range: 0.05 mg/kg to 0.09 mg/kg) in adults.  
  
Volatile anesthetics may decrease the dosing requirement for Mivacron and prolong the duration of action; the magnitude of these effects may be increased as the concentration of the volatile agent is increased.  
  
Isoflurane and enflurane (administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC \[Minimum Alveolar Concentration\]) may decrease the effective dose of Mivacron by as much as 25%, and may prolong the clinically effective duration of action and decrease the average infusion requirement by as much as 35% to 40%.  
  
Exercise caution when administering Mivacron to patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease, obesity, or any history suggesting sensitivity to the release of histamine (e.g., asthma), as a transient decrease in mean arterial pressure related to histamine release is possible.  
  
**Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) and Mivacron:  
**In a study of MH-susceptible pigs, Mivacron did not trigger MH.  
Mivacron has not been studied in MH-susceptible patients.  
  
**Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C  
**MIVACRON revealed no maternal or fetal toxicity or teratogenic effects in pregnant mice.  
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of MIVACRON in pregnant women.  
  
**Contraindications:**  
Patients known to have allergic hypersensitivity to the mivacron.  
Patients known or suspected of being homozygous for the atypical plasma cholinesterase gene.  
  
In common with other non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, increased sensitivity to Mivacron can be expected in patients with myasthenia gravis, other forms of neuromuscular disease and cachectic patients. Severe acid-base or electrolyte abnormalities may increase or reduce sensitivity to Mivacron.  
  
**Fertility, pregnancy and lactation**  
Fertility studies have not been performed.  
Animal studies have indicated that Mivacron has no adverse effect on fetal development.  
Mivacurium should not be used during pregnancy unless the expected clinical benefit to the mother outweighs any potential risk to the fetus.  
Plasma cholinesterase levels decrease during pregnancy.  
Mivacurium has been used to maintain neuromuscular block during caesarean section, but due to the reduced levels of plasma cholinesterase, dosage adjustments to the infusion rate were necessary.  
A further reduction in the infusion rate may also be required during caesarean section in patients pre-treated with magnesium sulfate, due to the potentiating effects of magnesium.  
It is not known whether Mivacron is excreted in human milk.
