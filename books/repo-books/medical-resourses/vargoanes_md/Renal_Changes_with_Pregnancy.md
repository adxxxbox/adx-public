### Renal Changes with Pregnancy

Renal function changes during pregnancy due to hormonal effects, the increased metabolic load of the fetus, and also due to outflow obstruction of the ureters by the enlarging uterus.  
The glomerular filtration rate increases by up to 50% in pregnancy.  
As a result, the clearance of urea, uric acid and creatinine all increase and their plasma concentrations are lower in pregnancy.  
  
Renal blood flow increases by 50% (identical to changes in cardiac output), thus artificially lowering BUN and creatinine.  
  
The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) increases from 100 to 150 ml/min by the second trimester causing an increased clearance of urea, creatinine, and drugs.  
  
Serum urea and creatinine levels decrease by 40%.  
  
The increased GRF exceeds the capacity of reabsorption within the distal tubules, leading to increased urine levels of glucose and protein. This may give a false impression of compromised kidneys.  
  
The upper normal limit of urinary proteins is 300 mg/day. This is double that of an accepted value of a nonpregnant woman.
