Spina Bifida Occulta   

### Spina Bifida Occulta

This is the mildest form of spina bifida.

There is a small gap in the spine, but no opening or sac protruding out of the back.

It is sometimes called “hidden” spina bifida. When the vertebrae of the spine do not close but the spinal cord and meninges remain in place and skin usually covers the defect. Sometimes spina bifida occulta is not even diagnosed until late childhood or adulthood.

**After Delivery  
**Sometimes there is a hairy patch of skin or dimple on the baby’s back, which is first seen after the baby is born. An X-ray, MRI, or CT, can be done to get a better view of the baby’s vertebrae.
