# Epinephrine

**Epinephrine (Epinephrine Hcl)**  
**Class:** Sympathomimetic, vasopressor.  
Natural occurring catecholamine.  
Comes in 1:1000 and 1:10,000 strength.  
**For infusion**\-we use 1,000 (1mg/ml)  
**For OETT**\- use 1: 10,000  
**Doses:**  
Cardiac Arrest (asystole) 1mg IV/IO Q 3-5 mins IVP (ACLS)  
**Concentration:** 1mL in a 250mL bag = 4mcg/mL  
**Drips** (1-16mcg/min or .01-1mcg/kg/min)  
1-2mcg/min uses beta 2 and alpha 1 stimulation.  
2-10mcg/min uses alpha and beta stimulation.  
\>10mcg/min uses mostly beta stimulation.  
**Peds:**  
Cardiac Arrest: 0.01mg/kg IVP Q3-5 minutes.  
**OETT:** 0.5 - 1 mL/kg of 1:10,000 solution.  
**Peds Drip**  
Initial dose 0.05 ug/kg/min.  
Titrate dose to desired response, not to exceed 1.0 ug/kg/min. An epinephrine dose of 0.05 ug/kg/min may be more effective than a dose of dopamine at > 15 ug/kg/min.  
**Effects:** Direct alpha and beta adrenergic receptor agonist. This causes:  
Increased myocardial contractility (inotrope) increases CI/CO.  
Increased HR (chronotrope).  
Increased vasoconstriction (decrease renal blood flow) increasing SVR and CVP.  
Increased brochodilitation.  
Increased glandular secretions.  
Increased glycogenolysis and lipolysis.  
**Indications:**  
Cardiac arrest (asystole)  
Heart Failure  
CHF  
Profound shock  
Hypotension  
Low CO/CI  
Failing myocardium unresponsive to other inotropic agents.  
Used with local anesthetics to increase duration and decrease toxicity.  
**Airway Edema or Bronchospasm:**  
Aerosol Treatment (Racemic Epi): 0.5mL of 2.5% in 3mL of NS  
**Receptor Sensitivity to Epinephrine:**  
**Beta 2:** greatest  
**Beta 1:** 2nd greatest  
**Alpha 2:** 3rd  
**Alpha 1:** least sensitive  
**Precautions:** Should be protected by light.  
Can be deactivated by alkaline solutions  
**Side Effects:** Palpitations, anxiety, tremulousness and N/V Adverse effects include increased myocardial and global oxygen consumption, tachycardia, and hypertension.  
**Elimination:** Hepatic  
**Administration:** Always use large IV, preferably a central line to avoid a nasty infiltration. Will cause extravasation necrosis. Treat extravasation with Phentolamine.  
**More Notes**  
Epi is an endogenous compound formed from norepinephrine.  
Normally produced with stress and produces widespread metabolic and hemodynamic affects via on the alpha and beta receptors.  
**Beta 1 receptors:** are most sensitive and are affected by very low plasma concentrations resulting in inotropic and chronotropic effects (that increase myocardial oxygen consumption).  
**Beta 2 receptors:** leads to vasodilation of splanchnic and skeletal muscle beds and bronchodilation.  
**Alpha 1 receptors:** vasoconstriction in skin and renal vascular beds occurs at all concentrations, while at higher concentrations, vasoconstriction effects in the pulmonary, splanchnic, skeletal muscle, cerebral, and coronary vascular beds predominate.  
High concentrations myocardial irritability occurs, manifested by atrial and ventricular dysrhythmias.  
**Metabolic effects:** at higher plasma concentrations, including hyperglycemia from a-adrenergic-mediated suppression of insulin release that leads to ketogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and accelerated glycogenolysis with resulting lactic acidemia.  
**Hypokalemia** is attributable to Beta 2 - adrenergic receptors linked to Na+-K+ ATPase in skeletal muscle.  
Other effects include hypophosphatemia, and activation of lipase.
