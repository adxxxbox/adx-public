Protein C Deficiency    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Protein C Deficiency

A deficiency of activated protein C (aPC) disturbs the delicate balance between procoagulant and anticoagulant proteins and creates a prothrombotic environment.  
  
**Frequency of protein C deficiency:  
**0.3% of normal individuals.  
Found in 1 in 200 to 1 in 500 persons in the US general population.  
However, many affected individuals remain asymptomatic throughout life.  
  
Protein C deficiency is present in approximately 2%-5% of patients presenting with venous thromboembolism (VTE).  
Predominant sex: Male = female.  
  
Protein C deficiency may be acquired via hepatic diseases.  
May also be hereditary.  
  
**Predominate age:** Mean age of first thrombosis is 45.  
  
**Risk Factors  
**Oral contraceptives, pregnancy and the use of hormone replacement therapy increase the risk venous thrombosis in patients with protein C deficiency.  
  
Having another inherited disorder of blood clotting in addition to protein C deficiency can also influence the risk of abnormal blood clotting-ex. factor V Leiden.  
  
**Genetics**  
Heterozygous protein C deficiency is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The gene for protein C is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 and nearly 200 pathogenic mutations have of this been described.  
  
**These mutations are divided into 2 types**  
Type I.  
Type II - on the basis of whether they cause a quantitative (type I) or functional (type II). deficiency of protein C.  
  
_**Type I Protein C deficiency**_  
Quantitative deficiency in the plasma protein C concentration.  
  
Heterozygous individuals typically demonstrate protein C antigen and activity levels that are approximately one half that of normal patient plasma.  
  
Patients may exhibit a severe thrombotic tendency, whereas others remain asymptomatic.  
  
_**Type II deficiency**_  
Type II protein C deficiency is less common than type I disease.  
Associated with decreased functional activity and normal immunologic levels of protein C.  
  
**MILD** **protein C deficiency**  
**Individuals with mild protein C deficiency are at risk of:** DVTs and PEs.  
  
Most people with MILD protein C deficiency never develop abnormal blood clots, certain factors can add to the risk of their development.  
  
**VTE in patients with protein C deficiency**  
Managed in much the same way as it is for patients with VTE due to other causes. Because the risk of recurrent VTE in protein C–deficient patients may be as high as 60%,long-term anticoagulation is often recommended, particularly following a spontaneous thromboembolic event.  
  
**MILD protein C Increased risk factors include:  
**Increased age  
Surgery  
Inactivity  
Pregnancy  
  
**Severe** **protein C deficiency**Severe homozygous or compound heterozygous protein C deficiency occurs in approximately 1 in 500,000 to 1 in 750,000 live births.  
Homozygous and compound heterozygous protein C deficiency are classically associated with neonatal purpura fulminans (NPF); intracranial thromboembolism may also occur in neonates.  
  
Infants with severe protein C deficiency develop a life-threatening blood clotting disorder called purpura fulminans soon after birth.  
  
Purpura fulminans is characterized by the formation of blood clots in the small blood vessels throughout the body. These blood clots block normal blood flow and can lead to localized death of body tissue (necrosis).  
  
Widespread blood clotting uses up all available blood clotting proteins. As a result, abnormal bleeding occurs in various parts of the body, which can cause large, purple patches on the skin.  
  
Individuals who survive the newborn period may experience recurrent episodes of purpura fulminans.  
  
_**Labs:  
**__Protein C assay.  
  
__**Disorders that may alter lab results:  
**__Oral contraceptives_ _can raise protein C levels._  
_Warfarin reduces protein C levels.  
Liver disease_ _can lower protein C levels.  
Acute thrombosis can lower protein C levels._  
  
_**Differential Diagnosis  
**__Factor V Leiden.  
Protein S deficiency.  
Antithrombin deficiency.  
__Dysfibronigenemia.  
__Dysplasminogenemia.  
__Homocysteinemia.__  
Prothrombin 20210 mutation.  
Elevated factor VIII levels.**  
  
General Measures  
**_Routine anticoagulation for asymptomatic patients.  
After first thrombosis: anticoagulation for 6-12 months.  
Some data suggest lifetime anticoagulation.  
  
_**Treatments:  
**_CEPROTIN \[Protein C Concentrate (Human)\] is used to treat patients with Severe Congenital Protein C Deficiency for the prevention and treatment of:  
Venous thrombosis (blood clot in the vein).  
Purpura fulminans.  
CEPROTIN temporarily raises the levels of Protein C in the body.  
  
**Protein C Vials:** 500 or 1,000 IU.  
LWMH-enoxaparin (Lovenox).  
Alternatively, 1.5mg/kg Sub Q per day for at least 5 days or until INR is 2-3 at which time it can be stopped.  
Tinzaparin (Innohep) 175 anti-Xa IU/kg SQ per day.  
Daltaparin (Fragmin) 200 IU/kg/day.  
  
Oral anticoagulant: warfarin (Coumadin) 5mg PO per day initially and maintained on warfarin with an INR of 2-3 for at least 6 months.  
  
**Warning: Warfarin-induced skin necrosis (WISN) and Protein C deficiency**  
_After an initial warfarin dose, the expedient reduced level of protein C activity relative to the half-lives of other vitamin K-dependent clotting factors creates a transient hypercoagulable state._  
  
Patients heterozygous for protein C deficiency who are begun on warfarin without concomitant heparin can develop warfarin-induced skin necrosis because the half-life of prothrombin (42 hours), another vitamin K-dependent clotting factor, is much longer than protein C. These patients develop extremely low levels of protein S relative to prothrombin and develop necrosis of the skin over central areas of the body such as the breast, abdomen, buttocks and genitalia.  
  
This effect is more pronounced when large loading doses of warfarin are administered.  
Indeed, WISN typically occurs during the first few days of warfarin therapy, often when daily doses in excess of 10 mg are administered.
