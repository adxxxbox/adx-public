### Prostatectomy- Perineal- Simple

(**Simple Perineal Prostatectomy)**  
  
Remember- Open (simple) prostatectomy has 3 different approaches:  
Retropubic  
Suprapubic  
Perineal

For the Perineal Prostatectomy, an incision is made in the perineum, midway between the rectum and scrotum through which the prostate is removed. This procedure has become less common due to limited access to lymph nodes and difficulty in avoiding nerves.

**Positioning is the biggest difference**  
The patient is in an exaggerated lithotomy. Legs are back with the knees touching the chest with mild reverse Trendelenburg. This looks painful! Just hope your patient stretched preoperatively because it looks painful.

**Ventilation Issues:** Yes, ventilation becomes difficult-Pressure Control Ventilation  (PCV) is usually required.  

Other than that, this is just another prostatectomy

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
Spinal is not recommended due to the positioning  
**IV Access:** 20g  
**EBL:** 50-200mLs  
**Duration:** 1.5-3 hours  
**OGT:** Consider it  
**Surgeon Position:** Foot of the bed  
**Positioning:** As above, arms do not have to be tucked.

**Advantages of Perineal Prostatectomy**    
Ability to treat clinically significant prostatic abscess and prostatic cysts  
Less postoperative pain  
Ability to avoid the retropubic space  
With regard to the last point, above, retropubic or suprapubic surgery is more difficult in patients who have had prior retropubic surgery

With perineal prostatectomy, patients may expect shorter hospitalization and less analgesic requirement but likely require a longer period of catheter drainage.
