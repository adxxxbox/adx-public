### Robotic Liver Surgery

(Robotic hepatic lobectomy, liver wedge resection, and segmentectomy)  
  
Since the liver is sequestered in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, open surgery for this condition requires a very large abdominal incision both under the ribs and extending to the midline. Furthermore, even with a large incision, exposure is challenging.  
  
**Minimally invasive**  
Many liver tumors can now be treated very effectively with minimally invasive surgical approaches, including robotic surgery, avoiding the need for a large incision and often facilitating removal of the tumor.  
Liver procedures that formerly required a large laparotomy incision can now be done with a few small incisions (less than one inch, on average).  
  
The liver is divided into two lobes and further subdivided into eight segments.  
The basic principle of liver surgery is to remove the tumor with negative margins while preserving enough remaining liver—as well as blood flow in and out of the liver—to maintain liver function.  
  
**Segmentectomy, wedge resection, lobectomy**  
For tumors in the periphery of the liver, either a single **segmentectomy** (surgical removal of one of the liver’s eight segments) or **wedge resection** (removal of the tumor along with some surrounding liver tissue) is often adequate.  
  
For larger tumors or more centrally located lesions, a formal right or left hepatic **lobectomy** (removal of one of the liver’s two lobes) may be required.  
  
**The liver grows back  
**The liver is unique in that after the diseased portion has been excised, the remaining functioning portion will hypertrophy (regrow) to help restore normal function of the liver. This regrowth can happen in as little as 2 to 3 weeks, and this is one of the reasons that even large portions of the liver may be aggressively removed.  
  
**Advantages of Robotic Surgery for Liver Cancer  
**Preservation of the abdominal wall from large subcostal incisions.  
Better postoperative diaphragmatic function with fewer respiratory complications,  
Better venous drainage in cirrhotic patients,  
Less postoperative ascites and reduced pain  
Less risk of incisional hernias and peritoneal adhesions.  
Enhanced intra-operative visualization  
Smaller incisions and scars  
Potentially quicker recovery times  
Epidural is not indicated  
Central line and CVP monitoring are not indicated  
Improved outcomes  
Less blood loss: pneumoperitoneum decreases oozing from the transection line with a positive impact on the overall blood loss.  
Faster return to normal activities (e.g., sexual function, urinary continence).  
  
_Laparoscopy is still not considered ideal for routine major hepatectomies, extended hepatectomies and for cases at high risk for bleeding._  
  
**Indications:**  
Hepatic neoplasms, both benign and/or malignant.  
Benign neoplasms include hepatocellular adenomas, hepatic hemangiomas and focal nodular hyperplasias.  
The most common malignant neoplasms (cancers) of the liver are metastases.  
Those arising from colorectal cancer are the most common, and the most amenable to surgical resection.  
The most common primary malignant tumor of the liver is the hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatectomy may also be the procedure of choice to treat intrahepatic gallstones or parasitic cysts of the liver.  
  
**Pre-op:**  
Labs: CBC, basic metabolic panel (BMP), Coagulation profile and blood glucose.  
Type and crossmatch with 2 units of PRBCs on standby.  
TAP block (epidural is not indicated)  
  
**Anesthetic:** General/endotracheal with rapid sequence induction  
**IV Access:** 2 large bore IVs  
**Duration:** 2-4 hours  
**EBL:** 200-400 ml  
**Central Line/CVP:** Usually not indicated, unless surgeon plans on using the Pringle maneuver.  
**Pringle maneuver:** Rarely utilized  
**A-line:** Required  
**Position:** Supine with slight reverse Trendelenburg. Arms tucked.  
Table may be rotated 90 degrees; ensure adequate tubing slack.  
  
**Foley:** Required. Maintain urine output at 0.5-1cc/kg/hr and adjust crystalloid or colloid replacement to blood loss.  
  
**Fluid:** 0.9% NSS is preferred in the presence of a compromised liver because the liver has difficulty metabolizing the lactate ion found in lactated Ringer’s solution. However, LR is nonetheless frequently used. Maintain normovolemia and slight hypovolemia if tolerated; this helps limit the EBL.  
  
**Phenylephrine drip:** Required, must be connected and checked before arms are tucked.  
  
**Blood transfusion tubing with fluid warmer:** Have available or connect in case of sudden  
Blood loss is much less than encountered during an open procedure.  
  
**Intra-op Labs:** ABGs, Hb/HCT  
**Emergence:** Deep extubation is acceptable.
