### Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) Notes and Facts

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a neurological emergency with high mortality rates. Early surgery (within 3 days) lowers the morbidity and mortality.

**Mortality after SAH**  
50% dead within 4 weeks  
70% mortality from the initial bleed  
30% mortality from re-bleeding and other complications.  
Re-bleeds do very badly: Mortality after first re-bleed is 64%; mortality  
from a second rebleed is 96%.  
Of those who died of the initial bleed, 74% died within the first 24 hrs.  
The patient’s condition on arrival is very important, with a 90% 10 day survival if the patient is in good condition and 20% if comatose.  
Only about 30% will survive without neurological deficits.

**Causes:**  
Usually by rupture of an aneurysm  
Rupture of an AVM  
Head trauma

**Usually diagnosed by CT scan**  
If the CT scan is falsely negative, a lumbar puncture could still diagnose the presence of a SAH. The CSF is tested for the presence of persistent blood and/or xanthochromia.

**Transmural Pressure (TMP)**formula: MAP-ICP = TMP The aneurysm’s pressure (TMP) is equal to the pressure within the aneurysm (arterial blood pressure) minus the pressure outside/around the aneurysm (ICP).  
Moderate increase or decreases in TMP will increase the risk of rupture! BP should be maintained and it is detrimental to the patient to rapidly lower or increase the BP. **Avoid drastic BP deviations!**

**Other Issues Seen with SAH:  
Hypertension**  
From autonomic hyperactivity. SAH causes a massive sympathetic discharge at the time of bleeding, which results in hypertension and may cause myocardial dysfunction.

**EKG Changes**  
The EKG changes are a result of intense release of catecholamines or hypothalamic stimulation. These changes are seen in 90% of patients within the first 48 hours following SAH. They occur in 50- 100% of patients during the acute stage of SAH. You may see a prolonged and flattened Q-T interval. Also inverted T waves with S-T segment depression are found; and prominent U waves may be noted as well.

The EKG changes do not appear to be associated with adverse cardiac outcomes. Studies show that even in patients with SAH who have ECG findings consistent with ischemia or myocardial infarction, the risk of death resulting from cardiac causes is low.

**Vasospasm-** Remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. See “Vasospasms after a Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.”

**Rebleeding-** from an untreated cerebral aneurysm. See Cerebral Aneurysm and Rebleeding.

**Hydrocephalus-** Occurs 10- 20% of the time following SAH due to impairment of CSF circulation by blood in the subarachnoid space. Hydrocephalus is not good with an unsecured aneurysm. We know that an increased ICP due to hydrocephalus is already bad for a sick brain. If they treat hydrocephalus before SAH surgery by reducing the elevated CSF levels via ventriculostomy or lumbar subarachnoid drain, the rapid release of CSF can cause rupture of the aneurysm due to the rapid change in TMP.

**Cerebral Salt Wasting (CSW) and or Syndrome of Inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH)**  
Hyponatremia occurs in 30% of these cases and may be due to CSW or SIADH.  
Some of us have noticed some huge sudden large urine output episodes, but it’s difficult to determine if giving Mannitol prior was the cause. SIADH reflects an excess of water and theoretically should be treated by fluid depletion. However, in SAH it is better to keep intravascular volume high so salt-containing IV solutions are usually used.

**The clinical grade of the SAH correlates well with the ICP. Grade I or II SAH**  
Assumed to have normal ICP  
Intact cerebral autoregulation  
Normal response to hyperventilation  
These patients are usually extubated at the end of surgery.

**Grade III or IV SAH**  
Increased ICP  
Impaired autoregulation  
Reduced CO2-reactivity  
Usually these patients are already intubated and not extubated at the end of surgery.

**The goals of anesthetic management with SAH:**  
Control the aneurysm’s TMP while maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion and oxygen delivery. Avoiding precipitous changes in ICP, because sudden reductions or increases in ICP produce acute increases in the aneurysm’s TMP.

Maximize surgical exposure and reduce retraction on the brain.

**Warning:** Until the aneurysm is clipped, DO NOT permit the BP to rise above the preoperative baseline. It will increase the aneurysm’s Transmembrane Pressure (TMP) and increase the risk of rupture.

Any reductions in ICP should be GRADUAL until the dura has been opened (ICP = 0), because sudden reductions in ICP produce rapid increases in the aneurysm’s TMP. This also increases the risk of rupture.  
  
Misdiagnosed “warning” headaches are generally followed by a major severe headache in the days or weeks before a substantial bleeding. These warning headaches are considered to be limited hemorrhages or “sentinel” leaks.
