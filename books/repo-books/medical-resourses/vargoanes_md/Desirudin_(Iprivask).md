Desirudin (Iprivask)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Desirudin (Iprivask)

**Class:** Direct Thrombin Inhibitor (DTI ) - bivalent and selective.  
An analogue of **hirudin,** the naturally occurring anticoagulant found in the salivary glands of leeches (Hirudo medicinalis).  
  
**Bivalent DTI  
**Bivalent DTIs block thrombin at 2 sites—the active (catalytic) site and exosite 1 (fibrinogen-binding site).

Desirudin was approved for use in the United States in 2003 and has been used in limited numbers of patients.  
  
**Desirudin and Orthopedic Surgery**  
In patients undergoing hip replacement, desirudin is more effective than unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparins in preventing deep-vein thrombosis, with a safety profile similar to both agents.  
  
**Advantage:** Being a DTI, it does not need monitoring like heparin or warfarin.  
Desirudin is highly selective for thrombin and binds with high affinity to both soluble and clot-bound thrombin.  
  
**Safe with HIT Patients**  
It is safe and compared with argatroban in an exploratory study in patients with suspected HIT with or without thrombosis  
  
**Indications:** Prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients undergoing elective hip replacement surgery.  
In clinical trials, desirudin given during and after hip replacement surgery was equivalent or slightly better than heparin in decreasing the frequency of DVTs and PEs during the perioperative period.  
  
**Mechanism of Action:**  
Desirudin is a direct inhibitor of free circulating and clot-bound thrombin.  
It selectively and directly inhibits the function of activated thrombin (Factor II).  
One molecule of desirudin binds to one molecule of thrombin and thereby blocks the thrombogenic activity of thrombin.  
As a result, all thrombin-dependent coagulation assays are affected.  
  
Like human antithrombin, Desirudin binds to both circulating and fibrinogen bound thrombin and thus both prevents and dissolves clots and thrombi.  
  
Heparins does NOT bind to both circulating and clot-bound thrombin.  
**Thrombin review:** Inhibiting thrombin (Factor II) prevents the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and subsequent cross linking of fibrin monomers, platelet activation and amplification of coagulation.  
  
**Lab Monitoring:** Because of reliability, here is no therapeutic drug monitoring widely available for DTIs, in contrast with warfarin and heparin.  
**  
Optional Labs**  
**Thrombin Time (TT)** is the most reliable.  
**Ecarin clotting time,** although not in general clinical use, would be the most appropriate monitoring test.  
**INR and PT:** May be prolonged in a nonlinear fashion.  
  
Normal **aPTT** indicates no desirudin effect.  
  
**aPTT:** There is conflicting literature that desirubin levels do not correlate with an elevated  
Other article states that there a clear correlation between increasing serum concentrations and prolongation of aPTT over a broad range of desirudin doses.  
There is a normalization of aPTT in 2–4 hours following discontinuation.  
  
**Possible Side Effects:** bleeding; other side effects are not common, but can include hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis.  
  
**Hypersensitivity reactions:** Particularly common and more likely to be severe in persons who have been previously treated with desirudin or other hirudin analogues such as bivalirudin.  
  
**Doses:** The usual dose is a 15 mg subcutaneously immediately before surgery and twice daily for 8 to 12 days.  
Route of administration: Subcutaneous or IV- never administer IM.  
  
_Administration of thrombin inhibitors in combination with other antithrombotic agents should always be avoided._  
Effect lasts for 1-3 hours after administration.  
  
A mean peak aPTT prolongation of about 1.38 times baseline value (range 0.58 to 3.41) was observed following subcutaneous BID injections of 15 mg Desirudin SQ.  
  
**T1/2:** just 35-40 minutes and a normalization of aPTT in 2–4 hours following discontinuation.**Hepatic -** No issues  
  
**For severe renal impairment:** **_T1/2 is_** _prolonged up to 12 hours instead of the normal 2-4 hours._  
  
**Excreted:** Renal, 40-50% unchanged of administered dose.  
  
**Antidote:** No specific antidote.
