### Succinylcholine (Anectine, Quelicin) Infusion Notes

Due to the risk of a Phase II block and FDA approval of sugammadex, a continuous infusion of succinylcholine is extremely rare.

**Adult Infusion dose range:** 0.5-10 mg/min  
**Common dose range:** 2.5-4.4 mg/min  
**Succinylcholine concentration:** 20mg/mL  
  
**Common mixture:** 1mg:1mL (remove 14.5 mLs from a 250 mL bag of 0.9% NS or D5W and add 14.5 mLs of succinylcholine; 250mg).  
Do not mix with alkaline solutions (pH >8.5).  
Titrate to obtain the required amount of relaxation.  
  
**Pediatric dosing:** Not recommended due a rare risk of succinylcholine-induced acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia and asystole.  
  
**Indications:** Procedures of short duration in which muscle relaxation is optimal.  
**Example:** Rigid bronchoscopy and microlaryngoscopy.  
Carefully monitor with a peripheral nerve stimulator with infusion in order to avoid development of a Phase II block  
  
**Intermittent IV injections** of succinylcholine may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An IV injection of 0.3 to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further injections of 0.04 to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required.  
  
**Possible complications:** Phase II block coinciding with the onset of tachyphylaxis and prolongation of spontaneous recovery.
