Excision of Plica     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Excision of Plica

Usually part of an orthopedic arthroscopic procedure. Half the time you are not aware the procedure was performed until the surgeon states it was done at the end of the case.

**Excision of Plica:** A Plica Syndrome or synovial plica syndrome is the result of a leftover fetal tissue (Plica) in the knee. Later in life it becomes irritated and swollen. Arthroscopically, the plica tissue is cut away and removed. The area where the plica is removed heals back with scar tissue.
