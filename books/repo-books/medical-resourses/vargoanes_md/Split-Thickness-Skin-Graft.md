### Split Thickness Skin Graft (STSG)

The surgeon basically slices a very thin square layer of skin with a device that looks like a fancy old cheese cutter and places the removed mesh looking skin over an older wound that is in the healing process.

There are two different types of skin grafts- Split thickness and Full thickness.

**Split thickness skin graft (STSG)** is thinner and can cover larger areas and has graft success rates of close to 100%.  However the STSG do tend to contract over time. They also don't always match the texture and color of the surrounding skin quite as well as full thickness grafts do. It uses the epidermis and small, varying amounts of dermis layers of the skin.

**Full thickness skin graft (FTSG)** is less popular and uses all of the epidermis and all of the dermis (deeper) layers of the skin.  
The FTSG is usually reserved for special areas that require full thickness grafts such as palms of hands or areas of the face, where cosmetics is more important.

FTSG do not to contract as much and have better matching color to the surrounding skin.

Unfortunately the FTSG don't always graft successfully. The amount of skin that can be grafted is limited, because the donor site is usually not regenerated like the split thickness grafts.

**Anesthesia:** General; usually LMA, rarely a deep MAC.

If the surgeon requests the prone position, usually ETT.  
**Duration:** 15-30 minutes  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
**Positioning:** Depends where the surgical site is; usually supine.  
**Location:** The graft is usually removed from the thigh, abdomen or buttocks. Depends on the wound and surgeon preference.

**More Notes:**  
These grafts are usually are harvested with either nitrogen- or electric-powered dermatomes which can be adjusted for depth of harvest as well as the desired harvest width.

The device basically looks like a loud electric cheese cutter (if one really exist).

The usual appropriate depth for harvesting skin to be applied to a wound bed in the distal upper extremity is between 0.012 and 0.014 inch.
