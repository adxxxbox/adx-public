**Surgical Correction  
**Surgical correction was initially performed by a German Physician Dr. Ramstedt, back in 1911. Known as the Ramstedt Pyloromyotomy, the muscle of the pylorus was divided to open up the gastric outlet. These procedures are now mostly being done laparoscopically (minimally invasive) because it’s proven to have a quicker recovery time. The open procedure involves a single incision usually 3–4 cm long. This is not a surgical emergency. The baby’s electrolytes should be corrected prior to surgery.

**NG Tube:** A lot of the literature says the baby will have one. If they do, connect it to suction. Many will lavage the NGT regardless until they are satisfied. Some will also position the baby lateral and apply suction. Today, most do not have a NG tube upon arrival.

**Pre- op -recommended labs before surgery  
**pH: Between 7.3-7.5 K: > 3.0mEq/L Na>130  
Chloride: > 85 mEq/L Hb>10 gm  
Bicarbonate: > 30 mmole/L  
Urine Output: 1-2mLs/kg/hr  
Specific Gravity: < 1.020

**Pre-Induction- Administer Robinul and suction out the stomach in 3-4 different positions prior to airway management  
**Administer 0.2mg of Robinul or 0.2mg/kg of Atropine.  
Many prefer Robinul since it does not cross the blood brain barrier. Also, be aware that systemic Atropine dilates the pupils.

A pediatric gastric tube is best used to suction out the stomach prior to induction. Pass the tube 2-3 times to ensure adequate emptying of the stomach. A suction catheter can be used but usually not as effective as an actual gastric tube or a red rubber.  
  
Many CRNAs commonly suction right lateral, left lateral, and in supine position, repeated until no more gastric fluid is present. Blow-by oxygen should be used during these maneuvers and one should be prepared for transient low O2 saturations during the gagging and suctioning.

**Induction:** Rapid sequence induction (RSI). Many books still say awake intubation (AI), which is the old method.  
**Inhalation induction:** No, IV is preferred  
**ETT:** Uncuffed 3.0 -3.5 ETT or cuffed 2.5-3.0 ETT is usual for a 4-8 week old baby. A cuffed, low pressure, high volume tube is recommended for laparoscopic cases and if the baby is suspected to remain intubated after surgery.

**Blade:** 0-1 Miller, 1 Wisconsin or Mac 0-1  
**NG Tube:** Usually not needed post op  
**Narcotics:** Minimal, consider giving rectal Tylenol pre-op.  
One important factor to keep in mind for these patients is their ventilatory changes related to the metabolic alkalosis. Therefore a "no narcotic" approach is often utilized, reducing the risk of postoperative hypoventilation.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Usually not needed and can complicate post op ventilation.  
**Position** : Supine  
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** The infant will already have one in from the NICU. You may need to change the baby’s IV bag if there is added Potassium in it. Flush the IV catheter before you do anything. Some CRNAs or MDs will start another IV regardless, after the baby is asleep.

**Hydration: 4:2:1** **(below is just a common reference)**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**How we treat a drop in BP:** We usually treat with Albumin using a 10cc syringe. If calcium levels are low or low normal, a small bump of calcium is also effective to reduce some hypotension, usually in a 10mg/kg dose.

**Possible Complications:**  
Aspiration  
Duodenal perforation  
Dehiscence  
Hernia  
Incomplete myotomy with recurrent vomiting  
Post-operative hypoventilation

**More Notes  
Dx: Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS)**

**Metabolic abnormality:** Lab work may demonstrate hypochloremic hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduria from loss of H+ and Cl- with vomiting.  
Initially, there will be excretion of Na-bicarbonate in response to Cl loss. Aldosterone acts to promote K excretion for Na retention. Finally, H is exchanged for Na, resulting in paradoxic aciduria.

**Treatment for** hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduria:+/- NS bolus. When UOP is demonstrated, K is added to IVF.  
D5 ½ NS + 20K @ 1.5-2x maintenance rate. You must resolve electrolyte abnormalities prior to surgery.
