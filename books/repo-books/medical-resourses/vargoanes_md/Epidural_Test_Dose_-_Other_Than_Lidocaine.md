### Epidural Test Dose - Other Than Lidocaine

Lidocaine is by far the most popular local anesthetic utilized today for epidural test doses for various reasons. Lidocaine is so popular that it comes with most epidural kits. Literature still exists describing the use of other local anesthetics for epidural test doses. They are not common anymore, but they are still listed below.  
  
**Bupivacaine:** 10-15mg, but now almost universally abandoned due to its high cardiotoxicity.  
  
**Ropivacaine:** 15 mg is _not_ a useful intrathecal test dose because the slow onset of motor  
blockade precludes timely diagnosis of intrathecal injection.  
  
**Mepivacaine:** 60-100mg has been documented, but rarely used anymore.  
  
**2-Chloroprocaine:** is the only local anesthetic that can be used as a single, combined  
**intravascular** and **intrathecal** test dose. In most patients, **100 mg** results in _dense,  
but not total, spinal anesthesia after intrathecal injection and produces systemic  
signs of subclinical toxicity (tinnitus, funny taste) after intravascular injection._  
  
**Test Doses with Fentanyl, Isuprel or Air (Rare)  
**_(Rarely done, but in the books)_**  
  
Test Dose with Fentanyl  
Fentanyl administered for an intravascular placement of epidural catheter  
**100 mcg of Fentanyl has been documented as a test for an intravenous injection.  
**Dizziness** as the most reliable symptom of the intravenous injection (sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 92%).  
  
Some situations reduce the reliability of subjective symptoms as an indication of intravenous injection of a drug, other symptoms were sedation, euphoria, and/or previous analgesia.  
  
**Mixing Isuprel with Epidural to check for intravascular placement of epidural  
**Epidural test doses containing > 15 mcg of epinephrine are reliable for the detection of intravascular injection based on systolic BP, more than the HR increase, in adult patients anesthetized with isoflurane.  
  
One article stated that the combination of 7.5 mcg of epinephrine mixed with 3 mcg of isoproterenol (Isuprel) produced the most reliable heart rate changes with minimal blood pressure fluctuations.  
  
**Air for Epidural Test Dose** (Don’t know who would do this below)  
It is documented that 1 ml of air was injected through each epidural catheter while heart tones were continually monitored with a Doppler ultrasound. The ultrasound probe was placed over the maternal precordium and monitored for maternal heart sound changes for 15 seconds. The air-test result was considered positive for an intravascular injection with a loud swishing sound, lasting at least 5 seconds was heard in addition to or in place of the normal “lub-dub” heart sounds.  
  
_**NOTE:** I remember an article in which 5 ml of saline was shaken to incorporate small air bubbles and this was injected. As you know, a precordial Doppler sounds like seagulls when air goes through the heart. Even microbubbles of air were found to change the tone. Careful placement of the Doppler probe is necessary to detect this. I think the article by Leighton was cited by Cynthia Wong, MD in a review article on test doses. The practitioners doing this used the OB Doppler, if memory serves._
