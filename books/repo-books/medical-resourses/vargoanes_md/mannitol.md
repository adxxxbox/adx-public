# Mannitol

**Mannitol (Osmitrol)**  
**Class:** Osmotic diuretic.  
An osmotically strong 6 carbon sugar that does NOT under go reabsorption.  
It appears to increase Renal Blood Flow (RBF).  
**Doses:**  
Pretty much whatever the surgeon tells us for that specific procedure.  
**Standard dose:** 25 or 50 grams WITH 20-40 mg of Lasix IVP  
**Most sources:** 0.25-2 grams/kg over 30 minutes.  
0.25-1 gram/kg  
They say use a filter.  
Osmolar concentration: 1372 mOsmol.  
80% of a 100 g dose appears in the urine in three hours.  
**Indications:**  
To decrease cerebral edema (ICP).  
Renal protection with aortic/renal clamping procedures.  
Prophylaxis against ARF in high risk patients.  
Decrease IOP during eyeball procedures.  
Sometimes is was used in Prostate surgeries  
**Caution:**  
Severe renal disease  
Pulmonary Edema and CHF (transitional)  
Active head bleed  
Dehydration  
**Increases:**  
Serum osmolality  
Excretion of K, H20, NaCl and HC03  
UO  
Transient expansion of intravascular volume  
Transient HTN, CI ,PCWP  
ICP and O2 delivery to the brain (initially)  
Renal Blood Flow (RBF)  
Intrarenal synthesis of vasodilating prostaglandins.  
**Decreases:**  
ICP and IOP  
Cerebral edema  
**More notes:**  
It all goes directly thru the glomeruli and none of it is reabsorbed from the renal tubules. While in the tubules, it osmotically prevents the reabsorption of water, Na, Cl and HCO3, thus increasing UO.  
**Transient expansion of intravascular volume**  
When it is first given (before its freely filtered by the glomeruli), a rapid intracellular to extracellular shift of water can transiently increase intravascular volume. This can challenge a compromised heart and cause pulmonary edema in these patients with a poor reserve.  
**For Craniotomies**  
While in circulation, it also increases plasma osmolarity and draws fluid from the intra and extracellular spaces. Cerebral fluid loss decreases brain bulk.  
**Renal protection:** There is also an increase in renal blood flow to the medulla.  
Mannitol effectively increases urine production and flushes the kidneys.  
This is important when clamping the aorta. The kidneys may solely depend on minimal collateral circulation during this time.  
By increasing urine output, Mannitol helps prevent kidney shutdown in cases of acute kidney failure. The drug can also reduce fluid pressure when treating glaucoma, which involves raised fluid pressure in the eye.  
It can also be administered to remove certain drugs and poisons from a patient's blood system, such as aspirin, barbiturates, bromides and carbon monoxide.
