### Alternatives to Heparin

If the patient is allergic to heparin, there are now alternatives that have been safely used for CABG and CPB.  
  
These are direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) They directly inhibit the procoagulant and prothrombin actions of thrombin.  
They do not interact with or produce heparin antibodies.  
  
**Lepirudin (Refludan)**  
A recombinant analogue of the anticoagulant hirudin produced in leech saliva. Has a short half-life of 80 minutes. Monitored by aPTT or ACT. Has NO antidote.  
Can be eliminated by hemofiltration by the perfusionist. Metabolized by the kidneys use caution in patients with poor kidney function.  
However, up to 60% of patients can develop antihirudin antibodies. There is still no evidence that these antibodies affect the anticoagulation activity of hirudin.  
  
The dose of r-hirudin is to be added to the priming solution-0.2mg/kg. The patient is to receive a 0.25 mg/kg intravenous bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 0.5 mg/min of a 1 mg/ml solution (30 ml/hr) to be started before cannulation for CPB.  
  
All patients should undergo a forced diuresis beginning at the termination of CPB using dopamine 2.5 micrograms/kg/min, furosemide 40 mg IV bolus, and 20% mannitol 200 ml.  
  
**Argatroban (Arganova, Argatra, Acova or Novastan)****  
Not FDA approved yet for CPB**  
Synthetic molecule derived from L-arginine and widely used in patients with HIT who require angioplasty. Half-life is 45-55 minutes. Does not react with heparin antibodies. Monitored by aPTT or ACT. Does not cause antibody production. Metabolized by the liver.  
Dosing: initial bolus of Argatroban (0.1 mg/kg) and a continuous infusion (5 to 10 µg/kg/min). ACT in 20 minutes after bolus. May take up to 100 minutes to achieve adequate ACT. May require 2mg boluses if the ACTs are not adequate for bypass.  
  
**Bivalirudin (Angiomax)**  
A synthetic peptide bases on the structure of hirudin. Has a short half-life of only 25 minutes. Monitor with aPTT, ACT. Dose: 1mg/kg bolus followed by 2 mg/kg/hr infusion. Metabolized by proteolytic enzymes present in the blood and by the kidney.  
  
**Ancrod** is derived from snake venom and acts as a defibrinogenating agent. It can be used for CPB, but cryoprecipitate and FFP are required to restore coagulation.
