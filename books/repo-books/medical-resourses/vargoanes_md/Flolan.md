### Flolan (Epoprostenol Sodium)

**Class:** Pulmonary hypertension therapy agents  
A prostacyclin analog.  
**Description:** Pharmaceutical form of prostacyclin; vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation; improves symptoms and prolongs survival in pulmonary hypertension.  
  
**How supplied:** Epoprostenol/Epoprostenol Sodium/Flolan/Veletri intravenous injection, powder for solution (Inj Pwd F/Sol): 0.5mg, 1.5mg.  
  
**Indications:**  
Treatment of PAH (pulmonary arterial hypertension) and right heart failure.  
Treatment of ARDS & refractory hypoxemia.  
  
**Administration:** Continuous IV or aerosolized.  
  
**Off-label use:** Aerosol administration for patients with primary pulmonary hypertension has been reported. Large randomized clinical trials are lacking.  
Flolan, or epoprostenol, is a synthetic prostacyclin.  
  
**Mechanism of Action  
**Epoprostenol, a synthetic analog of prostacyclin, activates the prostaglandin receptor leading to an increase in the intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) through activation of adenylate cyclase within smooth muscle cells.  
The increase in cAMP results in relaxation of the smooth muscle cells. When administered in aerosolized form it produces selective pulmonary vasodilation leading to improvements in ventilation-perfusion mismatch and oxygenation without systemic hemodynamic effects.  
Pulmonary vasodilation also may decrease pulmonary vascular resistance, reduce right ventricular afterload and increase right ventricular stroke volume.  
  
**Advantage of aerosolized Flolan over inhaled nitric oxide (INO)**  
INO is the only pulmonary vasodilator approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of PPHN. However, cost vs Flolan may be prohibitive in some cases ($135/hour vs $220/day) and epoprostenol lacks the toxic effects/metabolites of nitric oxide and therefore does not need a complicated delivery system.  
  
In the OR scavenging systems are used to remove exhaled NO, however, in the ICU these systems are not available; as a consequence, ICU staff are exposed to exhaled nitric oxide.  
From a physiologic standpoint there are comparable beneficial effects of pulmonary vasodilation vs INO.  
Reduced PAP  
Reduced PVR  
Reduced transpulmonary pressure  
  
**Pharmacokinetics of Flolan**  
**Onset:** 1-2 minutes.  
**Duration:** 3-5 minutes.  
**Metabolism:** spontaneous hydrolysis to inactive metabolite  
**Half-life:** 2-3 minutes.  
**Drug interactions:** minimal since it is aerosolized  
  
**Possible adverse effects**  
Inhibition of platelet aggregation.  
Bronchodilation.  
Systemic hypotension.  
**More common:** flushing, headache, nausea & vomiting, hypotension, anxiety, chest pain.  
  
**Precautions:**  
Abrupt withdrawal of epoprostenol can result in rebound pulmonary hypertension. Incremental weaning of therapy is recommended.  
  
**Relative contraindications:**  
Patient less than 16 years of age, thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 50,000/ul), Pregnancy  
  
**Absolute contraindications:**  
Known allergy or sensitivity to epoprostenol or glycine diluent  
Active pulmonary hemorrhage  
Secondary pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction  
  
**Abbreviations**  
**aEPO:** aerosolized Epoprostenol  
**NIV:** Non-Invasive Ventilation  
**HME:** Heat and Moisture Exchanger  
**pMDI:** pressurized Metered Dose Inhaler  
**AAD:** Adaptive Aerosol Device  
**VMN:** Vibrating Mesh Nebulizer  
**DPI:** Dry Powder Inhaler  
**PEEP:** Positive End-Expiratory Pressure  
  
**Dosing:** Continuous nebulization with nebulizer connected to the ventilator.Epoprostenol dose in nanograms per kilogram per minute **(ng/kg/min)** based on patient ideal body weight:  
**Male** \= 50 + \[2.3 x (height in inches – 60)\]  
**Female** \= 45 + \[2.3 x (height in inches – 60)\]  
  
**ARDS & refractory hypoxemia:**  
**Maximum dose:** 50 ng/kg/min based on ideal body weight (doses above this have not demonstrated any additional efficacy and may increase the risk of systemic side effects).  
**Dose range:** 10-50 ng/kg/min based on ideal body weight.  
**Initial dose:** is typically 50 ng/kg/min.  
aEPO should be titrated downward every 30 minutes as tolerated to 10 ng/kg/min based on PaO 2 improvement.  
**Weaning:** Decrease dose by 50% every 2 hours until less than 10 ng/kg/min.  
Once at 10 ng/kg/min, discontinue administration. E.g. 50 ng/kg/min, then 25 ng/kg/min, then 10 ng/kg/min, then discontinue.  
If patient does not tolerate this, a slower weaning process may also be used.  
**For example:** Decrease the dose by 10ng/kg/min q 2 hours until less than 10ng/kg/min. Once at 10 ng/kg/min, discontinue.  
**Example:** 50 ng/kg/min, then 40 ng/kg/min, then 30 ng/kg/min, then 20 ng/kg/min, then 10 ng/kg/min, then discontinue.  
  
**Pulmonary** **Hypertension and Right Heart Failure:  
Maximum dose:** 50 ng/kg/min based on ideal body weight (doses above this have not demonstrated any additional efficacy and may increase the risk of systemic side effects).  
**Dose range:** 5-50 ng/kg/min based on ideal body weight  
**Starting dose:** varies depending on patient setting and characteristics, but is typically initiated between 20-50 ng/kg/min.  
**Weaning:** Wean dose based on monitoring parameters.  
  
**Response to Therapy:  
**Response to therapy should be apparent within 10 minutes of initiation of treatment.  
  
**Positive response:  
**Patient shows ≥ 20% increase in PaO2, ≥ 20% reduction in pulmonary artery pressure (PA), or clinical or diagnostic signs of a reduction in pulmonary artery pressure  
  
**Negative response:**  
If a negative response occurs, resume previously tolerated dose and contact provider or  
Decline in PaO 2 :FiO 2 (P:F) ratio by > 25% reflects negative response.  
  
**Duration of therapy is dependent upon clinical response.**  
If no clinical response is noted in 2 hours, the inhaled epoprostenol should be incrementally decreased then discontinued.  
Doses higher than 50 ng/kg/min have not been shown to improve patient response.  
  
**MONITORING:  
**Patient should be continuously monitored as per ICU protocol with continuous telemetry, heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. Respiratory rate should be monitored continuously. If the patient has a pulmonary catheter (i.e. Swan-Ganz catheter), the mean pulmonary artery pressures should be recorded at the start of the therapy.  
  
Drug therapy should NOT be interrupted, even during transport  
  
Patient should remain closely monitored for rebound pulmonary hypertension per ICU protocol with continuous telemetry as described above at least 30 minutes following termination of aEPO.  
  
The following parameters will be continuously evaluated to monitor efficacy and safety: PA pressure and SaO2.  
  
Arterial blood gases (PaO2) Oxygen saturation PaO2/FiO2 ratio.  
PEEP requirements.  
  
Patient should be assessed for signs and symptoms of bleeding. Hemoglobin should be checked on a daily basis as per the ICU protocol, or sooner if there are signs and symptoms of active bleeding.  
If there is a decrease in mean systolic arterial pressure BP > 10%, immediately notify provider and discontinue aEPO. When mean systemic arterial pressure recovers, the medication can be restarted at half (50%) of the starting infusion rate.
