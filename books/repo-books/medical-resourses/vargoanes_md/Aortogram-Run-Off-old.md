Aortogram Run Off     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Aortogram Run Off

**Purpose:** These are arteriograms of the lower abdominal aorta and arteries in the legs. This exam is to search for a suspected arterial clot/occlusion. The doctor inserts some pretty long catheters via groin.  
This procedure is done on a narrow bed under fluoroscopy. You will need a lead apron.

  
**Pre-op:** First thing, **find out the patient’s level of Creatinine (Cr).**

If the Cr >1, then the patient will require a second IV for a HCO3 drip. The HCO3 is for preventing Contrast-Induced Nephropathy. I have also seen some institutions just insert one IV with the HCO3 drip piggybacked to a single IV. This is usually the Pre-op RN’s responsibility. Many surgeons will ask you the Cr level.

  
 **Anesthetic:** Almost always a light Mac with a NC/ETCO2.

The surgeon usually wants the patient awake and able to follow commands to take deep Inspiratory Holds (while the contrast dye is injected). So never sedate the patient to the point they cannot follow commands without checking with the doctor first. 

A continuous Dexmedetomidine infusion is becoming more common in these minor type vascular procedures.

  
**Procedure pain:** Very little, mostly from the initial local injection in the groin (catheter insertion site). I’ve seen many patients complain more about back pain or lying flat than the procedure itself.  
**Pulse Ox:** Consider a disposable finger sensor or tape the nondisposable sensor to the patient’s finger. Their arms are tucked and it is difficult to access and correct if the patient gets fidgety and the sensor becomes displaced.

**Prevention of Contrast-Induced Nephropathy**

When the Cr >1, a HCO3 drip is warranted to prevent Contrast-Induced Nephropathy. Many patients are already on the drip in Holding, so you should know the protocol and know the time the drip was started. You may be the one that has to decrease the rate after the first hour.  
 

**Common HCO3 Protocol (may vary)**

HCO3 bolus of 3 mL/kg/hr x 1 hr before iopamidol contrast, followed by an infusion of 1 mL/kg/hr x 6 hr.  
 

Always consider little fentanyl and versed. I have seen some CRNAs go the extra mile and use Precedex.  
 

Fentanyl is important because many times the patient becomes uncomfortable on the table and complains about back pain. This is not the procedure that you want a squirmy patient.

**Duration:** Depends what the doctor finds- 30 minutes to hours.

**Positioning:** Supine with arms tucked.  
**Heparin Available:** Yes  
**Blood Loss:** 20-80mLs.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable. Remember, arms will be tucked so they better remain patent.  
  
**Possible Complications**  
Contrast-Induced Nephropathy  
Allergic reaction to the dye.  
Hemorrhage  
Local wound complications: include groin hematoma, infection, or lymphocele.   
Access Artery Injury: Arterial thrombosis, dissection, or pseudoaneurysm formation can occur.
