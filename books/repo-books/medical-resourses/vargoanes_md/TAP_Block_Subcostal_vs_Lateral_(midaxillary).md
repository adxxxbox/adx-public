### TAP Block Subcostal vs Lateral (midaxillary)

TAP = Transversus Abdominis Plane  
**  
Lateral TAP block:  
**It is suitable for surgery below the umbilicus.  
The local anesthetic is injected between the transverse abdominus muscle and the posterior sheath of the rectus abdominis muscle.  
  
**Subcostal (SCTAP) block:**  
It is more suitable for supraumbilical and periumbilical analgesia.  
The local anesthetic is injected between the transverse abdominus muscle and the posterior sheath of the rectus abdominis (RA) muscle.
