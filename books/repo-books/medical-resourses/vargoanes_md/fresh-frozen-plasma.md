# Fresh Frozen Plasma

**Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)**  
When a unit of blood is donated (Whole Blood), the plasma portion is separated and usually frozen for future use.  
When thawed, it is referred to as FFP.  
**FFP contains:** albumin, clotting proteins, immunoglobulins, carbohydrates, salts, vitamins and other substances.  
Plasma is free of red blood cells, leukocytes and platelets.  
FFP has ALL the procoagulants EXCEPT for platelets.  
FFP is efficacious for treatment of deficiencies of factors II, V, VII, IX, X, and XI. No RBCs, platelets or WBCs  
  
**Doses of FFP:**  
**Standard:** 5-10mL/kg  
**Popular:** 10mL/kg  
1-2 units given for every 5 units of PRBCs.  
**1 unit:** Volume is 200-250mLs.  
**2 units (400-500mL) for active bleeding confirmed by:**  
PT > 1.5 (>18 secs)  
PTT > 1.5 (55-60 secs)  
Fibrinogen < 100mg/dL  
2 units (400-500mL)  
**Common antidote dose of Coumadin:**  
**Vitamin K:** 30 mcg/kg by slow IV infusion over 10-20 minutes (to avoid anaphylaxis). Max dose 2 mg.  
**FFP:** 20 ml/kg  
FFP is efficacious for treatment of deficiencies of factors II, V, VII, IX, X, and XI.  
**Most Popular Indications:**  
PT > 1.5 (>18); Normal is 11-14 secs  
PTT > 1.5 (55-60) Normal is 30-45 secs  
One of the antidotes for Coumadin (warfarin).  
**Other Indications of FFP:**  
For deficiency of antithrombin III in patients undergoing surgery or who require heparin for treatment of thrombosis.  
**Treatment of Immunodeficiencies**  
For infants with secondary immunodeficiency associated with severe protein-losing enteropathy and in whom total TPN is ineffective.  
A source of immunoglobulin for children and adults with humoral immunodeficiency.  
**More Notes**  
1 Unit contains 220 u coagulation factors  
Factor recovery with transfusion = 40%.  
1 Unit provides ~80 u coagulation factors70 kg X .05 = plasma volume of 35 dL (3.5 L)80 u = 2.3 u/dL = 2.3% (of normal 100 u/dL) 35 dL.  
In a 70 kg Patient:1 Unit Plasma increases most factors ~2.5%  
4 Units Plasma increase most factors ~10%.  
**Reversing Coumadin (Warfarin)**  
Patients who are anticoagulated with warfarin are deficient in the functional vitamin K dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as proteins C and S.  
These can be reversed with vitamin K and FFP.  
Consider giving **Feiba VH 50 - 70 units/kg IV** (first choice) or NovoSeven RT 90 micrograms/kg IV (alternate choice)  
Plasma is about 55% of blood volume.  
Plasma's constitution can be described as 90% water and 10% solid matter.  
1 unit of FFP prepared by plasmapheresis from a single donor is preferred OVER 2 units from 2 donors.  
Must be ABO compatible.  
Rh-pos plasma can be given to an Rh neg recipient except to young females.  
**Fibrinogen**  
FFP also contains 500 mg of fibrinogen.  
The fibrinogen in 1 unit of FFP is approximately equal to the amount of fibrinogen found in 2 units of cryoprecipitate.  
**Cross Matching FFP**  
Some literature states you don't need cross match (check) FFP because life threatening allergic reactions are unlikely. However many institutions still desire an ABO compatibility check.  
Transmission of HIV and Hepatitis is still possible.  
**How FFP is processed:**  
Separated from Erythrocytes and platelets of whole blood and placed at 18C or below within 8 hours after collection and stored at -18C for 1-7 years and thawed before it is transfused.  
After thawing it in a water bath at 37C, the unit must be administered within a few months.
