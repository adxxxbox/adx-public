### Factor V Leiden (FVL)

**Other names:** Factor V Leiden thrombophilia, Factor V Leiden mutation  
  
Factor V Leiden, named after the city in the Netherlands where it was first described in 1933, is a variant of the normal clotting factor V.  
It has since been found to be a leading cause of blood clots among white populations.  
Factor V Leiden alteration is the most common genetic risk factor for blood clots.  
The gene for factor V Leiden differs from the gene for normal factor V by a single nucleotide (nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA).  
  
As a result, it produces a protein that differs by one amino acid (amino acids are the building blocks for proteins) from normal factor V. While factor V Leiden is completely normal in terms of its ability to prevent bleeding, the one amino acid difference makes factor V Leiden resistant to being degraded or inactivated by protein C and protein S.  
  
Consequently, factor V Leiden lingers in the circulation longer and, therefore, contributes to the formation of blood clots.  
A genetic disease that is the most common congenital cause of venous thrombosis.  
It leads to resistance to activated protein C.  
  
In factor V Leiden, a point mutation at the binding site of activated protein C (APC)-Arg506Glu renders it less able to cleave factor V or Va. This reduces the anticoagulant role of factor V as a cofactor to APC and INCREASES the procoagulant role of factor V, creating a 20-fold slower degradation of factor Va.  
  
Patients with factor V Leiden without thrombosis DO NOT require prophylactic treatment.  
  
**Pediatrics:** Rare in this group.  
**Pregnancy:** Increases thrombosis.  
**Predominant age:** Thrombosis usually occurs after 2 nd decade of life.  
**Predominant sex:** Not different in males and females.  
  
**Incidence:** 3-12% of whites are affected.  
Rare in other ethnic groups.  
10-26% of patients with VTE are carriers of factor V Leiden mutation.  
  
**Thrombosis**  
Mostly venous, arterial thrombosis is rare with factor V Leiden.  
In unusual locations–sagittal sinus, mesentery, and portal systems–is less common compared to deficiency in protein C or S and in those taking oral contraceptives.  
  
**Risk Factors**  
VTEs are increased 7-fold in heterozygous and 80-fold in homozygous factor V Leiden patients.  
  
**This risk is increased with:  
**Having non-O blood type (2 to 4-fold).  
Oral contraceptives up to 100-fold decreased risk with desogestrel oral contraceptives.  
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and selective estrogen.  
Pregnancy and homozygous factor V Leiden increase the risk of thrombosis 7-16 fold.  
  
**Lab Tests:  
Initial -** for evaluation of a new clot:  
Factor V Leiden mutation analysis  
DNA-based test for factor V Leiden  
CBC with peripheral smear  
aPTT /PT/INR  
Thrombin Time  
Lupus anticoagulant  
Antiphospholipid antibodies  
Factor VIII  
Anticardiolipin antibody  
Anti-2 glycoprotein I antibody  
Activated protein C resistance  
Protein S antigen and resistance  
Antithrombin III assay  
Fibrinogen  
Factor V Leiden  
Prothrombin G20210A  
  
**Genetic Test:** DNA-based test for factor V mutation will be unaffected by anticoagulation and other drugs.  
  
Heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors may cause false-negative results of some tests.  
  
**Differential Diagnosis  
**Protein C deficiency.  
Protein S deficiency.  
Antithrombic deficiency.  
Elevated factor VIII levels.  
  
**Medications for Treatment  
**LMWHs.  
Enoxaparin (Lovenox): 1mg/kg SQ BID initially for at least 5 days or until INR is 2-3 at which it can be stopped.  
Tinzaparin (Innohep) 175 anti-Xa IU/kg SQ per day x 6 days and patient is anticoagulated with Coumadin (INR of at least 2 for 2 consecutive days.  
Daltaparin (Fragmin) 200 IU/kg/day.  
Oral anticoagulant: Warfarin 5mg PO daily initially and adjusted to an INR of 2-3.  
  
**Second Line:** Heparin 80mg/kg IV bolus followed by 18 mcg/kg/hour.  
Adjust dose depending on aPTT.  
  
**Prognosis**  
Most heterozygous patients do NOT have thrombosis.  
Homozygous have about 50% lifetime incidence of thrombosis.  
Recurrence rate after first thrombosis is not clear – usually 5%.  
DOES NOT increase overall mortality.
