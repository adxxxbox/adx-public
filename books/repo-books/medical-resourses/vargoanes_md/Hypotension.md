Hypotension    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

**Hypotension - Severe  
**Hypotensive episodes are common during anesthesia. When hypotension occurs in association with other events- tachycardia, non-sinus tachycardia, bradycardia, desaturation, anaphylaxis or other problems, you should cross reference to other appropriate protocols (algorithms).  
  
Severe intraoperative hypotension is an anesthetic emergency. Immediate recognition and treatment is vital to ensure adequate organ blood flow.

Initial management usually involves fluid bolus to optimize preload, and use of drugs to increase contractility and provide vasoconstriction.

An understanding of the etiologies, diagnosis, and treatment of this complication is critical to successful treatment of the patient.

**Treatment for Hypotension  
**Call for anesthesia help STAT and the code cart.  
Turn FiO2 to 100% and turn down your inhalation agent.  
Check Pulse and repeat BP (many providers immediately check a pulse and BP for confirmation before calling for a help).  
Check Rhythm.  
If Bradycardia (severe) see “Bradycardia” checklist.  
If V-Fib/V-Tachy, See “-Fib/V-Tachy” checklist.  
If Asystole/PEA, See “Asystole/PEA” checklist.  
Place the patient in Trendelenburg (check with surgeon first).  
Run IV fluids wide open.  
Give vasopressors and titrate to response.  
Administer:  
**Neosynephrine -** 40-80mcg IV  
**Ephedrine -** 10-20mg IV  
  
**Mild Hypotension  
**If HR is low - treat with Ephedrine.  
If HR is normal to elevated - treat with Neosynephrine.  
When the hypotension is refractory to Neosynephrine and Ephedrine, we usually administer **vasopressin** 1-2 units IV.  
Vasopressin: administer 2 units (1cc).  
(mix a small 1cc/20 unit vial with 9cc NS=2u/cc or 1 cc/20 unit with 19 cc NS = 1 u/cc)  
If your anesthesia cart does not have vasopressin, we usually refer to a low dose of diluted **epinephrine**.  
Epinephrine: administer 4mcg (1cc)

**Other considerations:**  
Obtain additional IV  
Start an A-line

**Consider Possible Causes:  
**Surgical manipulation  
Insufflation with laparoscopy (associated with bradycardia)  
Surgical retraction  
Vagal Stimulation (associated with bradycardia)  
Compression of a large blood vessel  
Severe blood loss  
Retroperitoneal or fracture bleeding

**Meds To Consider**  
Ephedrine: 10 – 25mg IV as needed  
Neosynephrine: 100 - 300mcg IV as needed  
Epinephrine: 4 – 16mcg IV as needed  
Vasopressin: 1 - 2 units IV as needed

**Possible Causes of Sudden BP**  
Erroneous BP Cuff reading (false alarm) – always check a pulse.  
Anaphylaxis - refer to Anaphylaxis.  
Recent drugs administered (narcotics? Beta-blocker?).  
Med error.  
Pre-op Ace Inhibitors or Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers.  
Hypovolemia.

**Ventilation Related Causes  
**Pneumothorax  
Increased Mean Airway Pressure  
(MAP): PEEP, Peak Pressure, I:E Ratio  
Hyperventilation/Hypoventilation  
Pulmonary Edema  
Hypoxia-Refer to Hypoxia

**Other Causes:  
**Venous Air Embolism (VAE)  
Other Embolisms  
Bradycardia  
Malignant Hyperthermia  
Bradycardia/Tachycardia  
Myocardia Ischemia  
Sepsis  
Tamponade  
  
**One study showed the causes of Intraoperative Hypotension were:**  
Drugs (26%)  
Regional anesthesia (14%)  
Hypovolemia (9%)  
Concomitant changes in heart rate or rhythm in 39% and oxygen saturation or ventilation in 21%.

**History of Hypertension and Intra-operative Hypotension**  
Patients with known **hypertension** are at increased risk of intraoperative hypotensive episodes. These patients are also more vulnerable to tissue ischemia as the lower limits for autoregulation may be raised.  
  
**Other examples:**  
Addison’s disease  
Hypothyroidism  
Carcinoid syndrome  
On chronic steroids- not pretreated (Hypothalamic-Pituitary Adrenal Axis)  
Burns  
Sepsis

**Hypovolemia**  
Hemorrhage  
Vomiting and Diarrhea pre-induction  
  
You should always assess your patient’s fluid status prior to surgery. A thorough examination should take place to assess the degree of dehydration or shock.

**Anesthetic technique**  
IV induction agents and inhalational agents reduce cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. In the elderly induction agents need to be given slowly and at reduced doses to avoid severe hypotension.  
Spinal and epidural anesthesia cause vasodilatation due to sympathetic block, and if the block is above T4 may also result in decreased myocardial contractility and bradycardia.

Patients undergoing combined regional and general anesthesia are particularly susceptible to hypotension.

**Pregnancy and Hypotension**  
Greater risk of hypotension due to aorto-caval compression compromising venous return, minimized by use of left lateral tilt to displace the gravid uterus.

**DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS  
**With the onset of intraoperative hypotension, a rapid assessment of the patient is required.

**You need to consider:**  
Was it a measurement error? Repeat the BP measurement  
Risks associated with the anesthetic technique  
Risks specific to the type of surgery or approach  
Known or possible allergies  
  
_When using non-invasive blood pressure measuring it is possible to estimate the systolic pressure by palpating a distal pulse during deflation of the cuff. If using invasive monitoring it is important to check that the level of the transducer is correct._

Hypotension is common with induction. Our anesthetics cause a dose dependent decrease in BP as a result of myocardia depression and decreased SVR from lower sympathetic outflow or both.

Intraoperative hypotension is usually defined as a mean arterial pressure less than 25% of the patient’s usual value. Untreated, it may result in inadequate organ perfusion.

Hypotension may be due to a low cardiac output, low systemic vascular resistance or a combination of both.

Risk factors include chronic hypertension and advanced age. The most common causes of intraoperative hypotension are anesthetic drugs (including regional anesthesia) and hypovolemia.

Initial management usually involves fluid bolus to optimize preload, and use of drugs to increase contractility and provide vasoconstriction. Thorough evaluation of the patient is required to identify specific underlying causes.
