Andexxa (coagulation factor Xa (recombinant), inactivated -zhzo)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Andexxa (coagulation factor Xa (recombinant), inactivated -zhzo)

Also known as andexanet alfa.**  
  
Andexxa is the first antidote to reverse two direct oral factors Xa inhibitor anticoagulants:**  
Apixaban (Eliquis®)  
Rivaroxaban (Xarelto®)  
  
**As of 9/2019, the FDA has currently NOT approved Andexxa for the reversal of other direct factor Xa inhibitors:  
**Enoxaparin (Lovenox)  
Fondaparinux| (Arixtra)  
Edoxaban (Savaysa)The FDA approved Andexxa (andexanet alfa) on May 3, 2018.  
  
**Indication:** When reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding from Apixaban or Rivaroxaban.  
  
**Mechanism of action:**  
It competes with endogenous factor Xa to bind with factor Xa inhibitors, thus elevating free endogenous factor Xa levels.  
It also binds and inhibits the activity of the Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI).  
Inhibition of TFPI activity can increase tissue factor (TF)-initiated thrombin generation with a target rate of 30 mg/min, followed by continuous infusion for up to 120 minutes.  
  
**Dosing:  
The recommended dose of Andexxa is based on the following:**  
The time of the last dose of (apixaban (Eliquis®) or rivaroxaban (Xarelto®).  
Which oral factor Xa inhibitor was involved?  
_Each vial of Andexxa contains 200mg in powder form._**  
  
Dosing: Two types of doses for Andexxa  
**Low dose  
High dose  
**Low dose (5 vials):  
Initial IV bolus:** 400 mg (2 vials) at a target of 30 mg/min, immediately followed by…  
**Continuous infusion:** 480 mg (3 vials) at a rate of 4 mg/min for up to 120 minutes.  
**High dose (9 vials):  
Initial IV bolus:** 800 mg (4 vials) at a target of 30 mg/min, immediately followed by…**Continuous infusion:** 960 mg (5 vials) at a rate of 8 mg/min for up to 120 minutes.

**  
Reconstitution of Andexxa (200 mg vials):  
**Use sterile waterUse 20 mL or larger syringes and 20g or larger needles until the volume is achieved.  
**  
For continuous infusion:**  
Inject the mixed ANDEXXA solution from the syringe into an empty polyolefin or polyvinyl chloride IV bag with a volume of 250 mL or less.  
  
**Study results:  
**After a bolus of AA, the median anti-factor Xa activity decreased by 89% in those receiving Rivaroxaban and 93% in Apixaban  
The bolus dose was followed by a 2-hour infusion.  
Assessment at 12 hours showed good hemostasis in 79% of patients.  
However, thrombotic events occurred in 18% during a 30 day follow up.  
Due to this thrombotic risk, anticoagulation should be reinstituted soon after the control of bleeding when medically appropriate.**The most common adverse reactions:**  
≥ 5% of bleeding patients receiving Andexxa were urinary tract infections and pneumonia.  
The most common adverse reactions (≥ 3%) in healthy subjects treated with Andexxa were infusion-related reactions.  
**  
Other adverse effects:**  
Warning: Andexxa has been associated with serious and life-threatening adverse events:  
Arterial and venous thromboembolic events  
Ischemic events: MI and strokes  
Cardiac arrest  
Sudden deaths  
UTI  
Pneumonia  
After administration of Andexxa, the patient must be monitored for thromboembolic events, and anticoagulation should be initiated when medically appropriate.  
Monitor for symptoms and signs that precede cardiac arrest and provide treatment as needed.  
  
**Use of Heparin following administration of Andexxa:  
**Andexxa may interfere with the anticoagulant effect of heparin.  
The use of Andexxa as an antidote for heparin has not been established.  
Avoid the use of Andexxa for the reversal of direct FXa inhibitors (apixaban and rivaroxaban) prior to heparinization, as Andexxa may cause unresponsiveness to heparin.  
If anticoagulation is needed, use an alternative anticoagulant to heparin.  
  
**Costs:  
**The cost for Andexxa IV powder for injection (recombinant, inactivated 100 mg) is about $11,494 for a supply of four vials of powder for injection, depending on the pharmacy.However, the documented hospital single dose of Andexxa alone will typically cost between $24,750 and $49,500.  
  
**Quick review:  
**Direct oral anticoagulants have continued to increase since the approval of the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, in 2010.This was followed by the approval of direct factor Xa inhibitors, which included rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, within a 5-year time span.  
**  
Direct factor Xa inhibitors’ advantages over warfarin:  
**DO NOT require routine coagulation monitoring.Have a comparable safety profile.  
**  
Disadvantages:  
**Not all direct factor Xa inhibitors have a reversible antidote.Available antidotes are very expensive.  
**  
Facts:  
**Factor Xa inhibitor-related bleeding numbers are growing.In 2016, approximately 117,000 hospital admissions in the U.S. were attributable to Factor Xa inhibitor-related bleeding.  
More than 84,000 patients experience significant bleeds.  
There are nearly 2,000 deaths per month.  
Patients with the most severe life-threatening bleeds have 30-day mortality rates of up to 40%, with an average hospital stay of 10 days or more.  
Administration of Andexxa to patients with ICH decreases mortality12%.  
Mortality of ICH without Andexxa is 48% and with Andexxa is 36%  
The Markov model showed that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of Andexxa over the standard of care is $211,056 for an intracranial hemorrhage and $40,718 for a gastrointestinal bleed.  
  
If Andexxa is not available to reverse apixaban (Eliquis®) or rivaroxaban (Xarelto®) during a life-threatening hemorrhage, administer prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and/or activated PCC (aPCC) until bleeding is controlled.
