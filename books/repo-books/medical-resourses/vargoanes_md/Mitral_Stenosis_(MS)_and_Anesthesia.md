### Mitral Stenosis (MS) and Anesthesia

**Short Version:**  
**Preload:** Maintain  
**Afterload:** Maintain  
**Rate:** Slow to normal: Avoid tachycardia  
**Contractility:** Maintain  
  
_Prevent and treat events that could decrease cardiac output (CO) and produce pulmonary edema._  
  
**Quick reference: Hemodynamic goals in Aortic Stenosis**

**Patients with severe mitral stenosis  
**A sudden decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) may not be tolerated.  
  
**Pre-op  
**Patients with pulmonary HTN should be on O²  
Maintain medications to control HR such as digoxin, Ca++ channel blockers, beta blockers or amiodarone. These drugs should be taken the day of surgery.  
Avoid diuretics preoperatively on the day of surgery.  
  
**Pre-op sedation  
**Premedication can cause hypoventilation, hypercarbia and hypoxia and exacerbate pulmonary edema.  
**Preload:** Proceed cautiously and avoid pulmonary edema  
**Afterload:** Maintain a normal to a mildly elevated SVR.  
Hypotension should be treated promptly with alpha-adrenergic receptor agonists in order to maintain coronary perfusion.  
**  
Drugs to maintain SVR**  
Phenylephrine infusion  
Vasopressin may be considered because it has little effect on pulmonary artery pressure.  
  
**Inotropes to optimize the right heart if needed  
**Milrinone and epinephrine  
  
**Heart Rate:** Maintain a sinus rhythm.  
HR of 50-70 BPM is optimal.  
Normal sinus rhythm and a slow rate are desired to allow time for forward flow and filling of the left ventricle.  
Atrial stroke volume is often elevated. It is important to maintain this.  
MS patients are dependent on the atrial “kick” for cardiac output, which is in contrast to aortic stenosis patients.  
Consider selective beta-1 blockers (esmolol or metoprolol) for tachycardia.  
Consider esmolol over metoprolol since esmolol it is shorter acting.  
Avoid pancuronium and ketamine.  
Rapid heart rates, especially with atrial fibrillation, decrease diastolic filling time and markedly decrease cardiac output.  
A-fib should be urgently cardioverted.  
**Contractility:** Maintain; The LV function is not altered with MS.  
  
**Conditions to avoid perioperatively  
**Trendelenburg (pulmonary edema)  
Pulmonary HTN  
Tachycardia  
Hypercarbia (exacerbates pulmonary HTN)  
Hypoxia (exacerbates pulmonary HTN)  
Decreased SVR (hypotension)  
Hypothermia (exacerbates pulmonary HTN)  
Light anesthesia (tachycardia)  
Acidosis (exacerbates pulmonary HTN)  
Sympathomimetics (tachycardia)  
Ketamine (tachycardia)  
Pancuronium (tachycardia)  
Robinul with reversal (tachycardia)  
  
**Induction  
**Consider etomidate or low-dose propofol for severe mitral stenosis to avoid hypotension.  
Have esmolol and phenylephrine available with induction.  
  
**Nitrous Oxide:** Avoid. It may evoke pulmonary vasoconstriction and increase pulmonary vascular resistance if pulmonary hypertension is present.  
  
**Avoid light anesthesia  
**The surgical stimulation could result in sympathetic stimulation (tachycardia).  
  
**Regional Anesthesia**  
Peripheral blocks are acceptable.  
Neuraxial anesthesia: Utilize measures to avoid hypotension and tachycardia.  
Avoid spinals because they cause hypotension.  
Epidural may allow better control of the sympathectomy and reduction of BP.  
Be careful with adding epinephrine.  
Hypotension can be difficult to treat.  
  
**Be aware of procedures that require Trendelenburg  
**Trendelenburg may increase central blood volume and can precipitate CHF.  
Consider asking the surgeon to compromise with positioning.  
  
**Maintenance of anesthesia  
**Avoid drugs that affect heart rate, myocardial contractility and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance .  
  
**Muscle Relaxant Reversal  
**Consider administering sugammadex instead of neostigmine and robinul to avoid tachycardia.  
  
**Pulmonary Hypertension**  
Consider a pulmonary vasodilator when severe pulmonary hypertension is present  
Can be treated intraoperatively with inhaled nitric oxide or prostacyclin.  
  
**Post-op  
**Avoid pain induced tachycardia  
Anticoagulation should be restarted as soon as the risk of perioperative bleeding is diminished.
