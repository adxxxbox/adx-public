### Cesarean Section - General Anesthesia (Step by Step)

**Before you start any C-section, you should know where all the following is:**  
Arterial line  
Central line  
IV bags/tubing/catheters  
Airway equipment/Bougie/Glide Scope  
Pitocin/Methergin/Hemabate  
Emergency meds  
  
Know where Methergine and/or Hemabate is located:  
**Hemabate (Carboprost Tromethamine)  
**Standard Dose: 250mcg IM  
**Methergine (methylergonovine)  
**Standard Dose: 0.2mg IM  
**Pitocin (Oxytocin)  
**Standard Dose: 20 units IV  
**Pre-Op (Besides standard H & P)  
Labs:** H/H, BMP and Coags  
Aspiration prophylaxis: é risk  
**Assess Airway:** 10x more likely for difficult intubation  
  
**Glide Scope:  
**Should always be close by.  
Always know where the emergency drugs, equipment and lines are located.  
Consent.  
Neosynephrine or ephedrine available.  
  
**Aspiration Prophylaxis**  
Bicitra  
Pepcid  
Reglan (controversial now due to side effects)  
  
**Patient in the room  
_Patient is still awake (not sedated ) until induction_  
**Patient is positioned left lateral tilt  
IVF wide open  
Administer antibiotics that are ordered (ask the surgeon)  
Monitors applied/vital signs**  
  
While you are preparing for induction, the team will:  
**Foley insertion/abdominal prepping and SCDs applied  
Surgical Drapes up  
Confirm quick timeout and consent  
  
**After the surgeon informs you when they are ready** Immediate RSI/Intubation  
When ETT placement is verified, immediately inform the surgeon  
Skin Incision  
Cut time to delivery is usually < 3 minutes  
OGT  
**  
Delivery of baby  
**Administer Pitocin and communicate with surgeon concerning bleeding  
Administer pressors (Neosynephrine or ephedrine) if needed  
Call for blood if needed  
Administer narcotics if stable enough  
  
Literature states that half MAC with Nitrous reduces uterine bleeding (relaxation). Many CRNAs use Sevoflurane at full MAC and the patients seem to do just fine.  
  
**Emergence  
**Breath the patient back  
  
**Do not emerge the patient until after the “uterine massage.”  
**After skin closure and the application of dressing, a nurse will perform a uterine massage (forcefully pushing down on the uterus from the abdomen) in attempt to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. This is painful for any patient who has not had a regional. Do not awake the patient up during this.  
  
If you prefer a perform a TAP block for abdominal pain, do it prior to extubation**Indications of GA/ETT** (When Regional Anesthesia (RA) is contraindicated)  
Coagulopathy/Low platelet count  
Blood infections  
Massive Hemorrhage  
Placental Abruption  
Uterine Rupture:

-   Placenta Accreta/percreta
-   Skin infection on the lower back

Cord Prolapse with non reassuring fetal heart tracings

-   Neurological problems

Severe scoliosis  
Maternal disease - severe preeclampsia.  
Cardiac disease - such as aortic stenosis or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.  
Failed Regional.  
Perceived lack of time for regional anesthesia.  
Patient refusal.
