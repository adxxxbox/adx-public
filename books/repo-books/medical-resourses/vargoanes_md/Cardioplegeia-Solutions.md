### Cardioplegia Solutions: Variable and subject to change

Cardioplegia provides nutritive flow and myocardial cooling. The solutions used can have anywhere from 10-100mEq/L of potassium. They may either be a buffered or a blood-based solution.  
  
Blood-based solution is most frequently used because it improves post-op ventricular function more than crystalloid solution. It can contain 50% dextrose (D50) and/or magnesium.  
  
The MPS (myocardial protection system) by Quest Medical, has a high concentration of potassium and magnesium in a small volume of crystalloid and maintains the Hb hemoglobin concentration (microplegia).
