### Epidural Infusion Doses

**Infusion Doses or Rates are set on the PCEA Pump  
**_Higher infusion rates provide much better sacral analgesia!  
  
_**Basal Rate:** 8-15 ml/h is a common range for labor using a PCEA pump.  
Most providers infuse around 9-12 ml/hr.  
_Higher infusion rates provide much better sacral analgesia!  
_  
Instead of using a high infusion rate and risking a higher block to cover sacral analgesia, many providers will run a slightly lower infusion rate and give the patient the opportunity for a higher “demand” dose when the patient experiences labor pain.A bolus dose given in addition to the infusion is called a **“Top Off”** dose. See **“Top Off”** doses for specifics.  
  
Ineffective analgesia is often due to inadequate basal hourly rate and therefore more frequent bolus doses resulting in "lockout."
