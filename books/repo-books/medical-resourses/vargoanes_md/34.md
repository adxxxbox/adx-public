### Give Salvaged RBCs (“Cell Saver”)

As soon as the arterial cannula is removed and bypass is discontinued, the perfusionist will soon start to spin the blood with the Cell Saver.  
  
Once you are given the cell saver, you give it fast (unless the heart is looking full and then you can slow it down). The amount of cell saver you receive will depend on the blood loss, usually around 500mLs.  
  
_Note:_ Ask the perfusionist if the cell saver blood is reversed (no longer heparinized). it usually is. If it is not, give 50mg more protamine. Some give In some instances 50mg of protamine is administered regardless. Communicate to other members of the care team if the salvaged RBCs were treated with protamine.
