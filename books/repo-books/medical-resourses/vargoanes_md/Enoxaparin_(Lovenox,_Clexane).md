Enoxaparin (Lovenox)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Enoxaparin (Lovenox)

LMWH - antithrombotic properties.  
Has different waiting times with regional anesthesia with different doses.  
  
_Low dose prophylaxis has a shorter wait time.  
Larger treatment doses 1-1.5/mg/kg have longer wait times._  
  
Lovenox is usually administered subcutaneously (SQ) on the abdomen.  
These patients will come with a bruise on their abdomen at each injection site.  
Enoxaparin should not be administered the morning of a scheduled procedure.  
  
Enoxaparin is gaining popularity in the acute coronary syndrome field, and there are also some new indications for its use as IV bolus in emergencies.  
There have been concerns about activated clotting time (ACT) monitoring of enoxaparin in patients receiving the medication SQ.  
  
**Indications:  
**Prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism.  
Prophylaxis of ischemic complications of unstable angina and nonQ-wave myocardial infarction, when concurrently administered with aspirin.  
  
**Mechanism of Action:  
**Enoxaparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin that accelerates formation of antithrombin III-thrombin complex and **deactivates thrombin,** preventing conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. It has a higher anti-factor Xa to anti-factor IIa activity than unfractionated heparin.  
Works within the intrinsic & common pathways (Xa), no effect on extrinsic pathway.  
  
**Treatment of Acute ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction  
**When administered concurrently with aspirin, has been shown to reduce the rate of the combined endpoint of recurrent myocardial infarction or death in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) receiving thrombolysis and being managed medically or with percutaneous  coronary intervention (PCI).  
  
**Monitor:** LMWHs overdoses are rare so they are not routinely monitored.  
**AntiXa Activity (** antifactor Xa assay): Most reliable  
**Optional Labs:** PTT, ACT, TEG  
**APTT:** Only slightly affected  
**ACT:** More accurate with IV administration-monitored during percutaneous coronary  
intervention (PCI).  
  
If measuring is desired, check peak antiXa level 3-4 hours after dose.  
Observed peak AntiXa levels for Q12h dosing of LMWHs = 0.5-1 units/mL.  
Observed peak antiXa levels for Q24h dosing of LMWHs = 1-2 units per mL.  
  
You can also check trough antiXa levels prior to the next dose = <0.5 units/mL.  
  
Elevated troughs suggest impaired clearance.  
  
**LMWH Therapeutic Ranges (target anti-Xa levels measured 4 hours after dosing):  
  
Enoxaparin (Lovenox)**  
Therapeutic bid dosing 0.6-1.0.  
Therapeutic qD dosing >1.0.

**_Note-Fondaparinux (Arixtra)_** _is an anticoagulant that shares the same pentasaccharide sequence as UFH and LMWH for the binding to antithrombin, however it has no extra chain and thus, is NOT considered a heparin product. It is also known to not cause HIT, as seen with UFH and LMWH._

  
**Metabolism:**  
Lovenox is primarily metabolized in the liver.  
  
**Clearance:** Renal clearance of active fragments represents about 10% of the administered dose and total renal excretion of active and non-active fragments 40% of the dose.  
  
**Excretion:** renal excretion  
**T1/2:** 4.5 hours (single dose).  
7 hours (repeated dose).  
  
Additionally, the use of aspirin and other NSAIDs may enhance the risk of hemorrhage.
