### Possible Localized and SystemicTourniquet Complications

**Possible nerve injury:**

-   Can range from paresthesia to paralysis.
-   Caused predominantly by compression, but ischemia also contributes.
-   Compression causes intraneural microvascular abnormalities in the segment of nerve adjacent to the cuff.
-   Resulting edema causes compromised tissue nutrition and axonal degeneration.
-   Maximal at proximal and distal edges of cuff, where shear stress is most significant.
-   More common in the upper limbs than the lower limbs.
-   The most common upper limb nerve injury is the radial nerve, followed by the ulnar and median nerves.
-   The most common lower limb nerve injury is the common peroneal nerve.

**Possible muscle injury:**

-   Caused by ischemia and mechanical deformation of tissue.
-   Greatest at sites distal to the tourniquet.
-   Can be minimized by using lower inflation pressures.

**Possible vascular injury:**

-   Direct vascular injury is uncommon and mostly occurs in children, the obese, the elderly, and patients with peripheral vascular disease.

**Possible skin injury:**

-   Tourniquet inflation may result in pressure necrosis or friction burns.
-   Chemical burns may occur when skin preparation solution seeps beneath the tourniquet and is held against the skin under pressure.

**Possible Systemic Complications:**

**Cardiovascular:**

-   Increased CVP due to increases in blood volume (up to 15%, from fluid shifts) and systemic vascular resistance from limb exsanguination and tourniquet inflation.
-   Increased HR, Systolic BP, and Diastolic BP – after 30-60 minutes of tourniquet inflation; related to tourniquet pain and ischemia.
-   Responds poorly to analgesia or increasing anesthetic depth.
-   Interventions which may reduce cardiovascular stress include ketamine, dexmedetomidine, magnesium sulphate, clonidine, and remifentanil infusion.
-   Hypotension following cuff deflation – drop in CVP and MAP due to shift of blood volume back into the limb and release of ischemic mediators into systemic circulation.
-   Treat with IV fluids and vasopressors.

**Respiratory:**

-   Increased ETCO2 following cuff deflation – outflow of hypercapnic venous blood and metabolites into the systemic circulation.
-   Related to duration of ischemia and is greater with larger limbs/muscles.
-   Peaks at 1-3 minutes following deflation.
-   Treat by increasing minute ventilation.

**Cerebral:**

-   Increased cerebral blood flow following cuff deflation – secondary to increased ETCO2 following cuff deflation.
-   Patients with increased ICP are at risk of adverse effects.
-   Prevented adverse outcomes by maintaining normocapnia (increasing minute ventilation).

**Hematological:**

-   Hypercoagulable state – tourniquet inflation and surgical pain, which increases platelet aggregation and coagulation factors.
-   Transient increase in fibrinolytic activity on cuff deflation – release of tPA causes activation of antithrombin III and thrombomodulin-protein C anticoagulant system, contributing to post-tourniquet bleeding.
-   Maximal at 15 minutes and returns to baseline within 30 minutes of tourniquet release.
-   Risk of precipitating sickle cell crisis due to circulatory stasis, acidosis, and hypoxemia.

**Metabolic:**

**Production of ischemic mediators, including CO2, lactate, and K+ may result in the following changes following tourniquet release:**

-   Increased serum K+ by approximately 0.2mmol/L (peaks at 3 mins)
-   Increased serum lactate by ~ 2mmol/L (remains elevated for 30 mins)
-   Decrease in pH due to CO2 and lactate (maximal decrease at 4 mins)
-   Increased oxygen consumption and CO2 production following tourniquet release.
-   Treat by increasing FiO2 and minute ventilation.
-   The above changes are dependent on the duration of tourniquet inflation.

**Temperature:**

-   Increasing core body temperature following tourniquet application – reduced surface area for heat loss, causing less heat transfer from the central to the peripheral compartment.
-   A fall in core body temperature following cuff deflation – redistribution of body heat and hypothermic blood from the ischemic limb.

**Pharmacological:**

-   Altered volume of distribution of medication – tourniquet inflation isolates the limb from the remainder of the body.
-   Administer prophylactic antibiotics 5-10 minutes prior to cuff inflation to allow for adequate tissue penetration.

**Pain:**

-   Typically, patients are resistant to systemic analgesia and deepening of anesthesia.
-   Pain manifests as tachycardia and hypertension under general anaesthesia and occurs 30-60 minutes after cuff inflation.
-   Proposed mechanisms of tourniquet pain:
-   Pain is transmitted by C-fibers, which are usually inhibited by A-delta fibers.
-   After approximately 30 minutes, A-delta fibers are blocked by mechanical compression, while C-fibers remain functioning.
-   Release of prostaglandins from injured cells, which increases pain perception by sensitizing and exciting pain receptors.
-   Limb ischemia results in central sensitization via NMDA receptor activation due to repeated nociceptive afferent input from affected limb.
