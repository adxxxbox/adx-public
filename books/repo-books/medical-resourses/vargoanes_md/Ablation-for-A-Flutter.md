Atrial Flutter Ablation    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Atrial Flutter Ablation

\- The A-flutter ablation procedure is less involved than the ablation for A-fib.  
\- Atrial flutter usually arises from the right atrium.  
\- In 90% of the cases, it is an anti-clockwise circuit, and in 10% of the cases, it is a clockwise circuit in the right atrium.  
  
**Typical vs atypical atrial flutter:  
Typical atrial flutter:**  
\- Localized to the right atrium.  
\- This type of atrial flutter can be cured with a short outpatient catheter ablation procedure.  
**Anesthesia:** Local sedation or MAC via propofol infusion.  
  
**Atypical atrial flutter:**  
\- Atrial flutter arising in the left atrium.  
\- Most types of atypical atrial flutter can also be treated with catheter ablation, but the procedure is longer and more involved.  
\- Some of these cases can be very long, so most of us intubate anyway.  
\- Deep MACs are rare because of the time duration, and no movement is required.  
  
**Mapping:**  
\- After the right atrial mapping is completed for atypical atrial flutter, a single ablation line is created between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid valve (cavo-tricuspid isthmus ablation) to interrupt the flutter circuit.  
\- The cardiologist usually does not have to cross the atrial septum.  
\- Intubation with the need for esophageal temperature monitoring is NOT needed.  
  
**Anesthetic:** Depends on the type of atrial flutter  
**Muscle Relaxant:** Not required with general/ETT.  
Just prevent the patient from moving.  
**EBL:** Hopefully, minimal  
**IV Access:** 18 g  
**IV Tubing Extension:** It helps  
\- Tubing extension with a 3-way stopcock to administer medications without having to get closer to the patient is becoming more popular.  
\- The less radiation exposure, the better.  
**A-line requirement for typical atrial flutter:** No**A-line requirement for atypical atrial flutter:** Sometimes, it depends on the patient’s stability.**Foley:** Sometimes  
**Position:** Supine with arms tucked  
**Hydration:** Normovolemic  
**Esophageal Temp Probe:** Not needed  
**Neosynephrine Drip:** Yes. Available and plugged into the distal IV port.  
**Emergency Meds:** Have epinephrine and ephedrine readily accessible as they will be your drugs of choice for a possible cardiac tamponade.  
Have them ready.  
**Lead Apron:** Make sure you get one that fits because you will be wearing it for a long time.  
**Drips:** Usually Neosynephrine; titrate to affect.  
Depending on the EP lab you are in, there is usually a limited anesthesia space.  
  
**Possible Complications:**  
\- Cardiac Tamponade  
\- Inadvertent puncture of the femoral artery  
\- Femoral vein hematoma  
**  
Cardiac Tamponade:  
**\- If you see your arterial waveform dampen with a drop in BP, immediately troubleshoot the A-line while notifying the cardiologist.  
\- These cardiologists want to be informed immediately, even if it is a false alarm.  
\- There is usually a portable ultrasound near the patient or an ICE (Intra Cardiac Echo) catheter that can be used to quickly check for cardiac tamponade.  
**  
For Cardiac Tamponade:**  
\- Don’t panic and DON’T try to start additional IVs.  
\- Open your fluids wide open.  
\- Treat the hypotension with your diluted ephedrine or epinephrine.  
\- Neosynephrine is NOT the drug of choice for cardiac tamponade.  
\- The cardiologist already has at least 4 HUGE venous introducers up in the two femoral veins (some are 8 Fr).  
\- The cardiologist or staff should be able to connect a fluid bag and give volume if needed.  
  
**Pericardiocentesis and Cardiac Tamponade:**  
\- The cardiologist uses some large syringes and a stopcock that comes with the pericardiocentesis kit and performs a pericardiocentesis.  
\- The aspirated blood from the pericardium will be re-injected directly into the sizeable femoral line by simply turning a stopcock.  
\- Ask the cardiologist if he/she wants the Heparin reversed with Protamine.  
\- If the atrium continues to bleed, the patient will immediately be transported to the operating room for a thoracic surgeon to open the chest and repair the atrium.  
\- While the surgeon has full access to the heart, a Maze Procedure can also be performed to treat the A-fib.  
\- The Maze procedure takes a few minutes.
