### Breast Lift (Mastopexy)

Also referred to as “Breast Lift.”  
Sometimes this procedure is combined with breast augmentation.  
  
**The goals of breast lift surgery are three-fold:**  
1) to raise the nipple areolar complex of the breast to a higher and more youthful position.  
2) to tighten the skin envelope of the breast.  
3) to improve upper breast fullness and shape.  
  
The plastic surgeon raises and reshapes the breasts to give them a firmer, rounder look.  
Mastopexy corrects degenerative physical changes, by elevating the (internal) parenchymal tissues, cutting and re-sizing the skin envelope, and transposing the nipple-areola complex higher upon the breast hemisphere.  
  
**Surgical Procedure**  
The plastic surgeon cuts and removes excess tissues (glandular, adipose, skin), excises overstretched suspensory ligaments, removes excess skin from the skin-envelope, and transposes the nipple-areola complex higher upon the breast hemisphere.  
  
In surgical practice, mastopexy can be performed as a discrete breast-lift procedure, and as a subordinate surgery within a combined mastopexy and breast augmentation procedure.  
  
Moreover, mastopexy surgery techniques also are applied to reduction mammoplasty, which is the correction of oversized breasts.  
  
**Surgical indications:  
Breast ptosis:** Drooping breasts.  
**Pseudoptosis:** Sagging of the skin of the lower half (inferior pole) of the breast.  
**Parenchymal maldistribution:** The lower breast lacks fullness, the inframammary fold is very high under the breast hemisphere, and the nipple-areola complex has dropped.  
  
**Pathophysiology and presentation  
**As a woman ages, her breasts change in size and volume as the skin envelope becomes inelastic, and the Cooper’s suspensory ligaments, which suspend the mammary gland high against the chest, become loose. These changes result in the falling forward and the sagging of the breast and the nipple-areola complex (NAC).  
  
Moreover, additional in addition to tissue prolapse, postpartum diminishment (involution) of the voluminous milk glands in the breast aggravates the looseness of the suspensory ligaments, and of the inelastic, overstretched skin envelope.  
  
**Anesthesia and Mastopexy**  
**Pre-op:** Pre-operative sedation should be withheld until the plastic surgeon has marked evaluated the patient and marked the skin, which usually requires that the patient stand.  
  
**Anesthesia:** Almost always general using LMA. Endotracheal intubation if indicated.  
Monitored anesthetic care with deep sedation is rarely chosen.  
  
**Regional:** PEC blocks performed prior to emergence have shown excellent efficacy for analgesia after breast surgery, but are not yet frequently used.  
Paravertebral blocks are often used for major chest wall procedures, but are not common for mastopexy.  
  
PEC II block and serratus plane block (SPB) have been documented after induction and may be useful in breast surgery if they are performed with anterior intercostal and supraclavicular branch block. These blocks are to the chest as transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks are to the abdomen.  
  
**Positioning:** Supine with arms abducted < 90% and heavily secured (wrapped).  
Because the head of the OR table will be elevated to the sitting position at various stages of the procedure, adequate slack must be provided in IV lines and arms must be safely secured.  
  
**Duration:** 2-4 hours. Depends on extent of the procedure and whether breast augmentation is also carried out.  
**EBL:** 50-150 ml.

Possible risks and complications:  
**Anesthesia risks.  
Bleeding or hematoma formation.  
Infection.  
Poor healing of incisions.  
Tissue necrosis of the nipple-areola.  
Changes in nipple or breast sensation, which may be temporary or permanent.  
Breast contour and shape irregularities.  
Breast asymmetry.  
Fat necrosis.  
Fluid accumulation.  
Potential partial or total loss of nipple and areola.  
Deep vein thrombosis, cardiac and pulmonary complications.  
Possibility need for subsequent revision.  
  
**Contraindications to mastopexy:**  
Aspirin use.  
Tobacco smoking.  
Diabetes.  
  
**Out of pocket procedure**  
Mastopexy to correct breast ptosis is not indicated by medical cause or physical reason, but by the self-image of the woman; that is, the combination of physical, aesthetic, and mental health requirements.
