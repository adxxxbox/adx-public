### Somatic Pain and Visceral Pain with Labor

**Visceral pain** \- lower uterine segment distention and cervical dilation.  
**Somatic pain** \- descent of the fetus in the birth canal.  
  
**Visceral Pain:** comes from cervical stretching, distension of lower uterine segment and uterine ischemia (decreased or ineffective blood supply to the uterus).  
This pain can also be referred from the uterus to the abdominal wall, lumbosacral area of the back, iliac crests, gluteal area and down the thighs.  
**Somatic Pain:** comes from stretching of vaginal perineal tissues and pelvic floor it can be intense, sharp, burning and is localized.  
  
During the first stage of labor, women usually perceive the visceral pain of diffuse abdominal cramping and uterine contractions. In the second stage of labor, there is a sharper and more continuous somatic pain in the perineum.  
  
**Labor pain has two components:**  
**Visceral pain:** which occurs during the early first stage and the second stage of childbirth  
**Somatic pain:** which occurs during the late first stage and the second stage.  
  
**First stage of labor pain:** mediated by T10 to L1 spinal segments  
Parturients describe the pain as dull (visceral) and often poorly localized.  
  
**Second stage of labor pain:** mediated by T12 to L1, and S2 to S4 spinal segments from stretching of the perineum.  
Somatic afferent nerve fibers transmit impulses through the pudendal nerve to the spinal cord at S2, S3 and S4 levels.  
**  
Labor pain has a visceral component and a somatic component  
**Uterine contractions and cervical dilatation result in visceral pain.  
These pain impulses are transmitted by afferent, slow conducting, A-delta and C fibers that accompany the sympathetic nerves and enter the spinal cord at the **T10 to L1 level.**  
As labor progresses the descent of fetal head and subsequent pressure on the pelvic floor, vagina, and perineum, generates somatic pain, which is transmitted by the pudendal nerve **(S2-4).  
**These rapidly conducting somatic pain fibers are relatively difficult to block.  
  
In obstetric patients, regional analgesia refers to partial or complete loss of pain sensation below the T8 to T10 spinal level.  
  
**Somatic pain** is caused by the activation of pain receptors in either the body surface or musculoskeletal tissues.  
A common cause of somatic pain from the surgical incision.  
  
**Visceral Pain** Visceral pain is the pain we feel when our internal organs are damaged or injured and is by far the most common form of pain.  
  
Viscera refers to the internal areas of the body that are enclosed in a cavity.  
Visceral pain is caused by the activation of pain receptors in the chest, abdomen or pelvic areas. It is vague and not well localized and is usually described as pressure-like, deep squeezing, dull or diffuse. It is caused by problems with internal organs, such as the stomach, kidney, gallbladder, urinary bladder, and intestines.  
These problems include distension, perforation, inflammation, and impaction or constipation, which can cause associated symptoms, such as nausea, fever, and malaise, and pain. Visceral pain can also be caused by problems with abdominal muscles and the abdominal wall, such as spasm.
