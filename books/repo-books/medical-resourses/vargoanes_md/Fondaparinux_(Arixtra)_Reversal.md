### Fondaparinux (Arixtra) Reversal

_Currently, there is a lack of specific antidotes for the growing number of new (novel) anticoagulants that are slowly replacing warfarin and heparin. For this reason, there is NO universal standard of care for the treatment of the anticoagulated bleeding patient when there is no specific antidote._

**Consult cardiology for ALL patients with coronary stents.**  
  
**Fondaparinux Quick Notes:  
**Indirect Xa Inhibitor.Selectively and IRREVERSIBLY binds to antithrombin III.  
  
**Plasma T1/2:** 17–21 hours with single-daily dosing with normal renal function.  
Prolonged in patients with renal impairment.  
  
**Specific antidote:** None  
Andexanet alfa: Awaiting FDA approval.  
  
**Hemodialyzable:** Yes; ~20% may be removed.  
**Protamine:** Not effective.  
  
**Initial Treatment**  
Discontinue fondaparinux or determine time of the last dose.  
  
**Consider routine lab tests:** CBC, BMP, liver function tests and DIC.  
  
**Optional laboratory tests  
**Anti-Xa assay for Arixta-most reliable.  
  
**Normal Anti- Xa assay:** indicates no anticoagulation effect.  
**Elevated PT:** Fondaparinux is present, but no linear correlation  
  
**Normal PT:** Minimal drug effect.  
**Elevated aPTT and INR:** Fondaparinux is present, but no linear correlation.  
  
**Fibrinolytic activity or bleeding time:** Not affected at recommended doses.  
  
**Mild Bleed  
**Hematology consult.  
Apply mechanical compression.  
Monitor and re-check labs.  
  
**Pharmacological Options for mild bleed  
Tranexamic acid (TXA):** Loading dose: 1 gram over 10min followed by maintenance dose of 1 gram over next 8 hours (125 mg/hr). Contraindicated with stents or recent MI.  
  
**Desmopressin (DDAVP):** 0.3 mcg/kg x 1.  
  
FFP or PRBCs may be considered when supportive measures and control of site of bleeding have failed.  
  
**_Severe or life-threatening bleed_**

**_PCC Warning_** _: Thrombotic and thromboembolic events including DIC, venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction and stroke have been reported after the administration of high doses. Patients must be monitored following administration._  
  
**Consider:  
****Factor VIIa** 30 µg/kg for life-threatening bleeding (BUT NO proven benefit).  
  
**KCentra™** if clinically necessary.  
**  
Emergent life threatening bleed:**  
FEIBA™ 8-25 units/kg or KCentra.  
**FEIBA™- Initial dose:** 8 units/kg, but can give additional doses if bleeding does not stop.  
  
**About FEIBA, KCentra and rFVIIa**  
**FEIBA:** is current formulary activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) product.  
It is the preferred agent for bleeding with the directing acting oral anticoagulants.  
**Initial dose:** 8 units/kg, but can give additional doses if bleeding does not stop.  
8- 25 units/kg, considered with excessive bleeding persists in an imminent life‑threatening event.  
  
**KCentra:** (4-factor PCC) 50 units/kg x1 at 3 units/kg/min (max dose 5000 units).  
KCentra is current formulary prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) product.  
Contains clotting factors II, VII, IX and X. It contains heparin and its use should be avoided in patients where heparin is contraindicated.  
  
**Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa):** 90mcg/kg of recombinant activated factor VII rFVIIa administration can help normalize coagulation times and thrombin generation.  
  
rVIIa will not affect anti-factor Xa activity and will not increase drug clearance.  
  
However, one assessment showed a greater impact with an aPCC 20 units/kg compared to rFVIIa.  
**_NOTE:_** _rVIIa will neither affect anti-factor Xa activity nor increase drug clearance._  
  
**More Notes  
**American Society of Hematology's Choosing Wisely ® initiative for 2014 warns against overuse of PCCs in the absence of clinical bleeding.  
**  
Bleeding with factor Xa inhibitors**  
Annually, 1% to 4% of patients treated with factor Xa inhibitors experience major bleeding, and an additional 1% may require emergency surgery. In 2015, more than 80,000 patients treated with oral factor Xa inhibitors were admitted to hospitals because of bleeding in the U.S.
