### Cancer and Procoagulation

Clotting activation and thromboembolic manifestations are common features in patients with cancer and account for a significant percentage of mortality and morbidity in cancer patients.  
  
Clinically detectable venous thromboembolism (VTE) is present in 15% of all cancer patients, and the number is likely to be even higher when subclinical thromboembolism (TE).  
  
**Tumor cells can directly activate the clotting system through two procoagulants:**  
Cancer Procoagulant (CP).  
Tissue Factor (TF).  
  
CP can activate factor X independently of FVII and cleaves the FX heavy chain at a different site compared with other known FX activators.  
  
**Cancer Procoagulant (CP)**  
Occurs only in fetal and malignant cells.  
CP can activate factor X independently of FVII and cleaves the FX heavy chain at a different site compared with other known factor X activators.  
  
It can be detected via an immunoassay for CP as a tumor marker.  
  
CP is also a tumor marker and growth factor from malignant tissue.  
  
The highest values of both procoagulants (CP and TF) are in the genitourinary cancer group in agreement with the greater presence of thrombosis observed in this group.  
  
Tissue factor (TF) is also known to be present at increased levels around malignant cells.
