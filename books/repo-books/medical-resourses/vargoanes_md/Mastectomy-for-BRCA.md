Mastectomy for BRCA     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Mastectomy for BRCA

This case is just like any other mastectomy, EXCEPT these patients DO NOT have cancer. The surgeon will not be removing an axillary node, so it does not matter where you place a BP cuff or IV catheter. You can also relax the patient if you desire, but always check with the surgeon.

  
Women identified as carriers of mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene have a substantially increased risk of breast cancer. Many medical professionals verbally phrase BRCA as “BRACA ONE or BRACA TWO.”

For this reason, many of these patients have prophylactic mastectomy and/or prophylactic oophorectomy.

**Anesthetic**: General with ETT or LMA  
LMAs are now becoming more popular. However, we traditionally almost always intubate.  
**Position:** Supine with arms out.  
**BP Cuff:** Any limb  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
**Duration:** 1-2.5 hours  
**EBL:** < 100mLs  
**Antibiotics:** Ancef if not contraindicated

**Note**: If it is not going to be a long case, there is no reason an LMA cannot be utilized unless there is a contraindication.

**More Notes**  
Bilateral prophylactic mastectomy is associated with a decreased risk of subsequent breast cancer of approximately 90%.

BRCA stands for breast cancer susceptibility genes, a class of genes known as tumor suppressors. Mutations of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have been linked to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.
