## TIVA Cocktails

Using a BIS monitor is popular with TIVA cases to prevent patient awareness. You always want your patient deep enough. Most of the time times we find that our patients are deeper than needed. You can titrate your anesthesia depth with the BIS results.  
  
Always administer versed unless contraindicated.

**Mixtures:**  
**Lazy Man’s TIVA**  
Start out your Propofol on 150mcg/kg/min.  
Administer 0.5mg/kg of ketamine prior to incision.  
Then administer 10-20mg of Ketamine Q1 hour.  
Administer 1cc of Fentanyl as needed.  
Titrate to BIS monitor.  
  
**Remifentanil:** (dosed on lean body mass, not total body weight).  
(2mg in 40mL = 50mcg/mL in a syringe)  
(1mg in 20mL = 50mcg/mL in a syringe)  
**Dose Range:** 0.2 – 2mcg/kg when infused independent  
**Most common:** 0.2mcg/kg as an adjunct to Propofol infusion Discontinue 5-10 minutes prior to emergence then titrate another narcotic (fentanyl or dilaudid) with returning respirations  
  
**Sufenta  
**Add 1 mL of Sufenta (50mcg) to 9mLs of NS syringe (10mLs total)= 5mcg/mL  
2mLs to 18mLs of NS syringe (20mLs total) = 5mcg/mL  
**Dose Range:** 0.25 – 0.5mcg/kg/hr  
Discontinue 45 minutes prior to emergence  
  
**Propofol  
**10mg/mL is standard  
**General Anesthesia:** 100-300mcg/kg/min  
  
**Ketamine:  
****Common Doses:** 0.5mg/kg IV push just prior to incision followed by 10mg-20mg IV push Q1h. Do not administer 45 minutes prior to emergence.  
  
BIS Monitoring is common for TIVA cases but not required.  
  
**For TIVA (Controlled Ventilation) – titrate propofol with BIS Monitor**  
  
**Propofol and Remifentanil in two different pumps  
**Propofol 125-175 mcg/kg/min with  
Remifentanil 0.2-0.3 mcg/kg/min  
Ketamine as described above is optional  
  
**Propofol and Sufenta in two different pumps  
**Propofol 125-175 mcg/kg  
Sufenta: 0.25 – 0.5mcg/kg/hr  
Ketamine as described above is optional  
  
**Propofol and Ketamine mixed and use only one syringe  
**(White lightening or Ketafol)  
Add 10-20 mg of ketamine in each propofol syringe on the infusion pump as opposed to 10-20mg bolus of ketamine separate Q1h. Don’t forget to bolus a separate 0.5mg/kg of ketamine prior to incision for the best results.  
  
**TIVA with Spontaneous Respirations  
****Propofol and Remifentanil  
**Start Remifentanil at 0.1mcg/kg/min x 3 minutes then drop it to 0.05/mcg/kg/min. Titrate changes of .01 to keep RR around 12bpm.  
At the same time (on a different pump) infuse propofol at 50mcg/kg/min.  
You should not bolus even 1mL of Propofol while infusing Remifentanil because it could cause apnea.  
Ketamine added as above is optional  
  
**Propofol and Ketamine  
**2mg of versed and 100mcg Fentanyl upfront  
Propofol at 50-100mcg/kg/min –titrate with RR  
10mg ketamine bolus Q15 minutes as needed first hour
