# Vecuronium (Norcuron) Doses and Table

  
Drip is normally only used in ICU  
1 powdered vial contains 10mg of vecuronium  
Reconstitute vial with 10mL of NS or sterile water.  
This gives you 1mg/mL concentration

* * *

**Initial Dose**  
Start IV bolus 0.1 mg/kg. Once you get at least two, twitches- start your drip at 1mcg/kg/min (ideal body weight). It usually takes around 20 mins to get back 2 twitches.

* * *

**Drip Range**  
0.8 to 1.2 mcg/kg/min  
Drip rate should be titrated to the patient twitch response as determined by a nerve stimulator. You will always want to keep at least 2-4 twitches of  
Train -of -Four (TOF) . This is so you can reverse the pt with the antidote at any time.

* * *

**Mix 100mg in a 250 bag of NS**  
(0.4mg/mL or 400mcg/mL)  
**Drip Range**  
0.8 to 1.2 mcg/kg/min  
**Equation below: (mcg/kg/min)**  
Desired dose x kg x 60 / mcg/mL = mL per hr

* * *

**Example:**  
say you desire 1mcg/kg/min for a 70k pt  
1 x 70 x 60 / 400= mL/hr  
4200 / 400 =10.5 so 10.5mL/hr = 1mcg/kg/min
