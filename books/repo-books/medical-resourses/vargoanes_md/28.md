### TEE Prior to Discontinuing Cardiopulmonary Bypass

By this time the cardiac anesthesiologist is called to the room. If a valve was replaced, we will insert the TEE probe (if not previously done) to visualize the heart.  
  
For the CABG without valve replacement, Trans-esophageal echocardiography determines the heart’s volume status, regional and global ventricular function, and reveals previously-undiagnosed abnormalities.  
  
However, many Anesthesiologists still don’t perform a TEE at the end of the case (CABG case without a valve replacement) and solely rely on the swan readings and experience to determine the heart’s needs.
