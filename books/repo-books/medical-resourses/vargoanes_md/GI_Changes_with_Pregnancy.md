### GI Changes with Pregnancy

  
(little change, except increased reflux)

**Morning Sickness (hyperemesis gravidarum)**  
In the first trimester, hormonal changes may result in morning sickness.  
The most extreme form of morning sickness is referred to "hyperemesis gravidarum." Sometimes it gets so severe that it requires admission to hospital for IV fluid resuscitation.  
  
**Heartburn (reflux) - due to LES**  
In pregnancy with the elevation of progesterone, there is a relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. This is combined with an increase in intra-gastric pressure due to the expanding uterus. 70% of pregnant women experience reflux.  
  
**Increases risk of aspiration**  
With the increased reflux, there is an increased risk of aspiration during induction of general anesthesia in the later stages of pregnancy.  
  
**RSI with Pregnancy**  
Due to the combination of factors above. RSI is considered mandatory when inducing general anesthesia in the third trimester and for 48 hours after delivery.  
  
**NPO with Pregnancy**  
NPO for a C-section is no different than the standard protocol for general anesthesia.  
No solid food for 8 hours prior to C-section.  
Clear fluids should be held 2 hours prior to C-section.  
For a patient in labor, only clear liquids are permitted, no solid food.  
  
**No change in gastric emptying until the onset of labor  
**Gastric emptying has not found to be delayed with pregnancy.  
Gastric emptying becomes delayed as labor advances despite less pain from an epidural.  
Epidural boluses containing opioids delay gastric emptying.  
Continuous epidural infusions with fentanyl do not delay gastric emptying.  
No change in gastric acid secretions have been observed with pregnancy.  
  
Some literature states that the gravid uterus may encroach on the stomach, increasing intragastric pressure and decreasing the effectiveness of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). This has not been proven.
