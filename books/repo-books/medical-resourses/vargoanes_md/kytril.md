# Kytril

**Kytril (Granisetron)**  
Same class drug as Zofran, but not nearly as popular.  
**Class:** anti-nauseant and antiemetic  
Highly specific and selective serotonin subtype 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist.  
More popular to prevent nausea before chemotherapy.  
Like Zofran- The FDA also previously noted cardiovascular safety. concerns which suggested Kytril could cause QT prolongation.  
**Doses:**  
10 mcg/kg IV  
0-1mg IV slow IV push  
Supplied in 1mg/mL vial  
**More Notes**  
Serotonin receptors of the 5-HT3 type are located peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema.  
During chemotherapy-induced vomiting, mucosal enterochromaffin cells release serotonin, which stimulates 5-HT3 receptors. This evokes vagal afferent discharge and may induce vomiting.  
Studies demonstrate that, in binding to 5-HT3 receptors, Granisetron blocks serotonin stimulation and subsequent vomiting after emetogenic stimuli such as cisplatin.
