### Hysterectomy - Vaginal

Vaginal hysterectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the uterus through the vagina without involving an abdominal incision. The surgeon detaches the uterus from the ovaries, fallopian tubes, upper vagina, blood vessels, ligaments and connective tissue that support it. The uterus is then removed through the vagina. The vaginal cuff is then closed and a vaginal pack is often left in place.  
Studies have shown that vaginal hysterectomy has fewer complications, requires a shorter hospital stay, and allows a faster recovery compared to removal of the uterus through an open abdominal hysterectomy.
