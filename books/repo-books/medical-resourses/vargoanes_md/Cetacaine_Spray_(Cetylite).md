**Duration:** 30 to 60 minutes **Cetacaine liquid with cotton applicator  
**Not popular in anesthesia  
Cotton applicator should not be held in position for an extended for a long period of time  
because local reactions to benzoate topical anesthetics are related to the length of time of application.  
  
**Cetacaine gel:  
Dose:** Apply ~1/2 inch x 3/16 inch  
Each 200 mg dose of Cetacaine (spray residue, liquid or gel) contains 28 mg of benzocaine, 4 mg of butamben and 4 mg of tetracaine HCl.  
Dispense and apply 200 mg of gel (a bead approximately 1/4 to 1/2 inches long) by gently depressing the pump.  
Application of gel in excess of 400 mg is contraindicated. Spread thinly and evenly over the desired area using a cotton swab.  
  
**Indications:**  
Suppressing the gag reflex  
Controlling pain and easing discomfort during dental and medical procedures  
  
**_Metabolism:_** ultimately be metabolized (primarily by plasma cholinesterases) to inert metabolites which are excreted in the urine.  
  
**Cetacaine contraindications  
**Cetacaine is not suitable and should never be used for injection.  
Do not use on the eyes.  
To avoid excessive systemic absorption, should not be applied to large areas of denuded or inflamed tissue. Should not be administered to patients who are hypersensitive to any of its ingredients or to patients known to have cholinesterase deficiencies.  
Tolerance may vary with the status of the patient.  
Should not be used under dentures or cotton rolls, as retention of the active ingredients under a denture or cotton roll could possibly cause an escharotic effect.  
  
Routine precaution for the use of any topical anesthetic should be observed when using Cetacaine.  
benzocaine ↔ sodium nitrite  
  
Sodium nitrite can cause a condition called methemoglobinemia that reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood to different organs, and combining the medication with benzocaine topical may increase the risk.
