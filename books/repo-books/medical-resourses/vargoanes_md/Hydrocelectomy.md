### Hydrocelectomy (Hydrocele Repair)

The removal of the abnormal sac of fluid that develops around the testicle. After a scrotal incision, the testicle is pulled through the scrotum and the fluid from around the testicle is drained.  
**Anesthetic:** General/usually LMA  
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes  
**Position:** Supine or frog- legged  
**EBL: Minimal  
Vagal Bradycardia:** Pulling of the genitals can cause a sudden bradycardia. Just be aware.

  
**Possible Complications:**  
2% risk of infection or complications.  
Injury to spermatic vessels.       
As with all surgical procedures, reactions to anesthesia, bleeding from the surgical incision, and internal bleeding can also occur.

**More Notes**  
A hydrocele is a pocket of watery liquid that has built up around your testicle. Sometimes this is because the testicle is diseased. More often it is because the liquid cannot drain into the circulation properly.
