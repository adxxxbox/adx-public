### Ear Surgery Notes

**Vasovagal Reflex and Asystole**  
This reflex can be triggered during mastoid surgery and can lead to cardiac asystole. A general awareness of this phenomenon is important. Stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve supplying the ear may also elicit a cough. This is known as Arnold’s reflex. Other reported manifestations of this vagal reflex include syncope.

  
**Ear procedures are divided into:** External Ear, Middle Ear, Mastoid and Inner Ear.

**External procedures:** Involve simple lesions, foreign bodies, external auditory canal, pre-auricular abnormalities and complex reconstruction of the auditory canal.  
  
**Middle Ear and Mastoid procedures:**  
Tempanic membrane procedures (Myringoplasty, Tympanoplasty)  
Stapedectomy  
Mastoidectomy  
 

**Inner Ear procedures: (**more complex)  
Cochlea, endolymphatic sac

**Why most EAR cases are General:**  
Nearly all surgery on the external middle and internal ear requires the use of an operating microscope. Any movement, coughing or straining is greatly magnified. Access to the airway is limited and a safe unobstructed airway is critical, so general anesthesia is usually preferred. Always ask the surgeon.  
  
**Arnold’s Nerve:** The auricular branch (also known as the mastoid branch) of the vagus nerve (Cranial Nerve X). It supplies sensory innervation to the skin of the ear canal. When this nerve is stimulated, it elicits a cough.

**Ear Surgery and PONV:**  
PONV is common with ear surgery involving the labyrinth and vestibular nerve.

Retching can dislodge or disrupt delicate surgical work and/or a surgical prosthesis.

**Consider giving:**  
Scopolamine Patch  
Zofran  
Decadron  
Droperidol  
Avoid N2O  
Propofol  

**Facial Nerve Monitoring (FNM):**  
Preservation of the facial nerve is essential during many ear operations. However, it is getting more difficult to get reimbursement for facial nerve monitoring. Avoid muscle relaxants with FNM. Iatrogenic facial nerve paralysis is 0.6-3%.

Monitoring of evoked facial electromyographic activity may assist in functional preservation of the facial nerve. FNM is common for middle ear, mastoid and inner ear procedures.

Electrodes are attached to the face. Partial or complete neuromuscular blockade abolishes the nerve activity and accidental transection of the facial nerve. Be sure at least 10-20% of muscle response remains. Always check with the surgeon.  
 

**Controlled Hypotensive Anesthesia:**  
Bleeding obscures the surgical field in ear procedures, especially under the microscope.

Avoiding hypertension is the key. Keep MAP 60-70mmHg, systolic around 85mmHg if not contraindicated by a high baseline BP. Keep the HOB up less than 15 degrees.  
Esmolol, Propofol/Remifentanil Drip, Labetalol or titrating Sevoflurane are popular cocktails for preventing hypertension.  
 

**Positioning of the Patient during Ear Surgery:**  
HOB up 15 degrees will help decrease bleeding.  
The patient’s head will be turned away from the surgeon and the operative ear up.  
Bed will be rotated 90-180 degrees. Make sure you have slack in your circuit and lines.  
The patient’s head will be covered (except ear). Access to airway is now very limited.

Arms**:** Neutral position and padding.  
  

**Head positioning Warning:**

Rotation of the head and extension of the neck is necessary for most ear procedures.

Remember to prevent compression of the internal and external jugular veins and carotid artery. Also try to avoid extremes of neck extension or head torsion. Injuries can occur to the brachial plexus (stretch injuries) or cervical spine.  Patients with limited carotid artery blood flow are especially vulnerable to further decreases in blood flow from exaggerated neck positions. A lateral tilt of the OR table can improve surgical access.

**Sensory Nerve Supply to the Ear**  
Auriculotemporal nerve  
Greater auricular nerve  
Auricular branch of the vagus nerve  
Tympanic nerve

 **Laser and Ear Surgery**  
The use of minimally invasive laser surgery for middle ear procedures is growing. Laser surgery reduces the amount of trauma due to vibration, enhances coagulation, and enables surgeons to access difficult to reach places in the middle ear. Laser surgery can be performed in an office operating room.
