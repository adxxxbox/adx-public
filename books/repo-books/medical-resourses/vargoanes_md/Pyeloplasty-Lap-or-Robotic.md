### Pyeloplasty- Lap or Robotic

Many of these cases are pediatric. The renal pelvis and its connection to the ureter are repaired. The ureteropelvic junction or UPJ is where the renal pelvis connects to the ureter. A pyeloplasty is an operation to correct an obstructed UPJ. 

The surgeon identifies the obstructed and enlarged kidney. Dissection is carried out to expose the renal pelvis and part of the ureter. The pelvis and ureter are dismembered above and below the obstruction. In UPJ obstruction, the small obstructed area is removed. Both of the divided ends are brought together and sutured.

A double J stent is inserted from below, up the ureter. The stent is removed in 4-6 days post op via cystoscopy.                    

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
**Duration** 2-5 hours  
**Position:** Lateral  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
**EBL: 20-100 mLs**  
  
**Possible Complications**  
Bleeding  
Infection  
Hernia  
Damage to tissues or organs  
Persistent leakage of urine  
Blockage of the ureter  
 

**More Notes**  
Obstruction of the UPJ can be caused by congenital abnormalities like horseshoe kidney, fibrous scarring due to a stone, a previous operation, or a stone that gets impacted in the upper part of ureter. This can cause damage to kidney tissue and eventually lead to pain, stones, infection, high blood pressure, and deterioration of kidney function and failure.

Over the past several years, robotic pyeloplasty was developed to give the same high success rate obtained with open pyeloplasty (>90%) while avoiding the large incision and associated pain and morbidity.

Although different types of pyeloplasty operations have been described, the ultimate goal is to remove the strictured portion of the UPJ, fashion the renal pelvis, and attach it to the ureter in a way to allow for easy drainage of urine down the ureter.  There are different ways to approach the kidney to perform the operation.  These include a flank incision, subcostal (under the rib) incision, trans-abdominal approach, or even sometimes through an incision in the back.
