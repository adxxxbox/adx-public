### Medtronic O-Arm (A Portable CT Machine)

**O-arm Surgical Imaging System**  
**Navigation System (A Portable CT Machine)**  
  
In some facilities, the Medtronic O-Arm is replacing the C-arm for various back and brain procedures.  
  
The O-Arm is optimal for minimally invasive back procedures.Many hospitals have an O-arm somewhere near the OR, parked and collecting dust. Because of the learning curve and minor inconvenience, most surgeons do not use it.  
  
It is simply a portable CT Scanning machine that looks like a fancy C-arm (but a little larger) which circles around the operating bed. When combined with Stealth Navigation, it drastically increases real time precision.  
  
3 Parts:  
The O-arm collects the images.A viewing cart is available in which the images are reconstructed.The Stealth Navigation Image Guided Surgery Unit.

The spine is 3-D, and being able to visualize the spine in 3-D in real time enables the surgeon to precisely apply hardware EXACTLY where he/she wishes. Having this critical information during each phase of the surgical procedure potentially reduces error and the need for repeat surgery.

In 26 seconds, the O-arm can take 755 high definition images.  
  
The O-arm allows the surgeon to perform a CT scan during surgery without having to move the patient. The surgeon can visualize anatomy in 2-D or 3-D.  
The C-Arm is only 2-D.  
  
Sometimes we are asked to stop ventilation while the O-arm is scanning the patient.

The setup is critical: The O-arm will be draped. The O arm will not fit under the operating room lights. The Cautery and blood collection is placed at the foot of the bed.  
Sometimes the bed needs to be moved away from our anesthesia area.

Later after surgery, the patient does not have to get a CT Scan to verify placement.  
It has an infrared camera to visualize blood vessels. All this drastically decreases operative times.
