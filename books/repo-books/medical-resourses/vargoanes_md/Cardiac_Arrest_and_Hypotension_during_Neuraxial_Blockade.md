### Cardiac Arrest and Hypotension during Neuraxial Blockade

(More common with spinals)

Cardiac arrest can occur with epidural and spinal anesthetics. However, cardiac arrest is more common with spinal anesthesia and may be as high as 1:1,500. Most cardiac arrests start out as bradycardia. In several cases, young healthy patients have suffered this complication.  
  
**Methods of prevention:**  
**Hydration** \- Hydrate the patient with fluid prior to the neuraxial block. In healthy adult patients 1 liter of fluid will help replace the fasting deficit. For healthy obstetric patients undergoing cesarean section, a pre-loading dose of 1.5 liters is helpful in reducing the incidence of hypotension and bradycardia. It is important to do this within 15 minutes of the block since 2/3rds of intravenous crystalloid solution administered will leave the intravascular space.  
  
**Aggressively treat bradycardia with atropine, followed by ephedrine and epinephrine.** Young healthy patients with high vagal tones are at risk for cardiac arrest during spinal anesthesia. A spinal anesthetic will produce a sympathectomy with UNOPPOSED vagal stimulation.  
  
**Don't be conservative with bradycardia!**  
In reviews it was found that delays in the treatment of bradycardia may have lead to cardiac arrest.  
Consider the risk factors for bradycardia during spinal anesthesia.  
  
**Risk factors include the following:  
**Baseline heart rate of < 60 bpm  
ASA class I  
Use of beta blockers  
Sensory level > T6  
Age < 50 years  
Prolonged PR interval
