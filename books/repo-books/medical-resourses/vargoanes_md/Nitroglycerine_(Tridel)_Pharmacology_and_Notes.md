# Nitroglycerine (Tridil) Infusion Notes

_The use of Cardene (Nicardipine) and beta-blockers have been replacing nitroglycerine in a surgical settings._

For 25mg/250 bottle (100mcg/mL)

Mostly titrate to effect because there is not real an optimal dose  
(0.2-1.5mcg/kg/min) or (5-200mcg/min).  
In **mcg/kg/min**\-Initial dose of 0.2mcg/kg min.  
**Range:** 0.2 - 1.5 mcg/kg/min, increasing increments of 0.1 mcg/kg/min Q 3-5 mins.

In **mcg/min**, most anesthesia providers start at 5 mL/hr (8 mcg/min) and titrate from there.  
Take 5 mL syringe, draw out 1 mL of NTG from the bottle, add 4 mL IV fluid in a syringe (20 mcg/mL).

**Nitroglycerine (Tridil) Notes**  
Other names (NITROBID IV, NITROJECT, NITROSTAT IV) (mcg/min) was usually the standard, weight based is becoming more popular-(mcg/kg/min)  
Most useful in patients with symptomatic CAD and with patients with HTN post CABG.  
Drug of choice for hypertensive emergencies with coronary ischemia  
Do not use with hypertensive encephalopathy because it increases ICP can develop tolerance within 12-24hr.

**MOA**_:_ Primarily a venous dilator (lesser degree - arteriolar dilator). relaxes peripheral vascular smooth muscle by donating an NO group

**Effect:** Relaxation of smooth muscle producing a vasodilator effect on the peripheral veins and arteries. Reduces cardiac oxygen demand by decreasing preload (left ventricular end-diastolic pressure) may modestly reduce afterload dilates coronary arteries and improves collateral flow to ischemic regions helps prevent vasospasm

**Side Effects:** Monitor for headache, hypotension, syncope, faintness.

**Anesthesia Indication:**To prevent or treat hypertension in the operating room setting in a temporary and short action fashion (Usually titrate to effect).

**ICU:** Prevent coronary vasospasm, sometime used as a preload reducer, can be given peripherally.

**Risk:** can cause severe hypotension in patient who is intravascularly dry, risk of methemoglobinemia, otherwise similar to nitroprusside.

Can be used cautiously without a pump and titrate to effect with a micro drip. Especially during caratids.  
Some Pharmacies offer special IV tubing with a vent. If your IV tubing does not have a vent, you will need to create one with a small gauge needle by inserting the needle tip in the rubber membrane on your Nitro bottle. Do not do this until your tubing is primed and infusing.
