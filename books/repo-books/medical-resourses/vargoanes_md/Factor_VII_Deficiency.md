Factor VII Deficiency    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Factor VII (Proconvertin) Deficiency

Patients with congenital deficiency of FVII have an increased risk of postoperative bleeding.  
An autosomal recessive disorder, both parents must carry the defective gene in order to pass it on to their child.  
Affects both males and females.  
  
**Homozygous deficiency:** May have factor VII levels low enough (<15%) for symptomatic bleeding.  
**Heterozygous deficiency:** Asymptomatic.  
  
The factor VII (FVII) gene is located on chromosome 13q34. More than 120 different mutations have been described.  
FVII is a vitamin K-dependent clotting factor synthesized in the liver.  
FVII deficiency prevents initiation of coagulation by the extrinsic pathway and may result in a highly variable degree of clinical bleeding.  
FVII has a half-life of approximately 3 to 4 hours.  
Can be inherited or acquired.  
  
**Reasons for acquired:**  
Liver disease.  
Vitamin K deficiency.  
Certain medications - Coumadin.  
  
FVII levels less than 2% of normal values are associated with a significantly increased risk of bleeding.  
  
**FVII deficiency can be divided into** **2 types,** Type 1 and Type II.  
**Type I:** Decreased synthesis or accelerated clearance.  
**Type II:** Dysfunctional FVII:Ag (presence of an antigen).  
  
The less factor VII, the more severe the symptoms.  
  
**Possible symptoms**  
Hemarthrosis.  
Menorrhagia.  
Hematuria.  
Epistaxis.  
Gingival bleeding.  
GI bleed.  
Retroperitoneal hematomas.  
Fatal cerebral hemorrhages or hematomas.  
  
**Clinically, the disease has been divided in four forms:**  
**Asymptomatic form:** Heterozygous.  
**Mild, late-onset form:** (60% of patients) postoperative cutaneous or mucosal bleeding.  
**Severe** **hemorrhagic form:** (20% of patients), recurrent hemarthrosis and consequently chronic arthropathy.  
**Severe life-threatening form:** (15% of patients), neonatal intracranial bleeding and often lethal course in infancy.  
  
**Labs:**  
_PT:_ Prolonged.  
_aPTT:_ Normal.  
_FVII assay:_ Confirms diagnosis.  
  
Check liver enzymes and platelet count.  
Elevated PT/INR with normal aPTT indicates FVII deficiency.  
  
Clinical bleeding can vary widely and does not correlate with FVII activity in plasma.  
  
**FVII activity level facts  
Note:** For surgery, individuals need clotting levels 20-25%.  
Maintaining FVII level of at least 15%-25% provides adequate hemostatic level for most surgical procedures.  
FVII activity of less than 10 % is associated with bleeding complications.  
  
Patient with factor levels < 1% generally need Factor VII.  
**  
Treatment Options for factor VII deficiency.  
**Recombinant VIIa concentrate (rFVIIa) - (NovoSeven).  
Factor VII concentrate: Half-life only  
Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (PCC) containing factor VII-for severe bleeding only.  
Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP).  
  
During surgery, many practitioners administer rFVIIa and monitor FVII activity.  
Some literature states that FVII activity need not be monitored perioperatively because of an inconsistent relation with clinical bleeding.  
  
**Prophylaxis Treatment  
**30-40 IU/kg of Factor VII concentrate or 15-30 μg/kg of recombinant activated rFVIIa (NovoSeven) are preferred over FFP prior to surgery.  
The two concentrates require less volume and lower risk of infection as compared to FFP.  
  
Recommended dose of of rFVIIa must be re dosed every 4-6 hourly until hemostasis is achieved, with timely monitoring of coagulation parameters.  
  
**Half-life of FVII:** Only 3 to 4 hours, repeated replacement therapy may be necessary.  
**Half-life of rFVII:** Only 2–4 hours, check FVII activity during surgery every 2 hours to maintain FVII activity above 10.  
  
**Possible complications of replacement therapy with rFVIIa**  
Thrombosis and production of antibodies against FVII.  
Measurement of FVII activity and PT-INR is helpful for preventing overdose administration.  
  
It is also stated that factor VII deficit increases the hemorrhagic risk during the surgical intervention although its importance is not always correlated with plasma concentration.
