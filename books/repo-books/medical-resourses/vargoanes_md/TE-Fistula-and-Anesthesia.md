TE Fistula and Anesthesia   

### TE Fistula and Anesthesia

  
_Edited by Jessica Metzler, CRNA, Charlotte, NC_

These procedures can be very stressful, until the esophageal fistula is clamped.  
Severe and prolonged desaturations around 60-75% is common.  
Hypotension is common from the effects of retracting the lung, one lung ventilation, and thorocoscopy.

Try not to panic and abandon your plan to avoid positive pressure ventilation (PPV) while maintaining spontaneous respirations or severe gastric distention may also occur. This is a common dilemma.

**Remember:** Most neonates can tolerate terrible saturations far better than adults!

The infant is usually positioned in the left lateral or modified left lateral position. Surgical incision is usually made under the right scapula and across the midaxillary line, at the fourth intercostal interspace. This allows surgeon to approach the vagus nerve, esophagus, trachea, and fistula by either the retropleural or transpleural route.  
Lung collapse, hypoxia, and hypercarbia usually occurs when PPV is NOT initiated and are most likely to occur during lung retraction.

Surgical retraction of the upper lung may kink the main bronchus. The right lung will be at least partially collapsed during surgery because the trachea is approached extrapleurally or transpleurally through a right thoracotomy.

Once the fistula has been identified, isolated and clamped, you are usually permitted to relax and ventilate the patient. The fistula will be transected from the trachea. The trachea fistula orifice is then sutured and sealed.

After this, the surgeon will anastomose the proximal esophageal atresia (closed pouch) with the distal esophagus that has been removed from the trachea.

If primary esophageal anastomosis is not possible due to a large gap between the proximal and distal esophagus (long gap atresia), a second stage will be planned at a later date. This second stage is called a “Colon Interposition. ” The surgeon uses a segment of the colon as a bridge to anastomose the proximal and distal esophagus.  
  
Cardiac reasons or poor lung status may also cause the procedure to be staged.

**Location of Patient**  
These neonates/infants are already in the NICU or PICU and usually stable with IV access. Surgery usually occurs in the first few days of life.  
Any associated anomalies should already be identified. Remember, up to 50% of neonates with TEF may have associated anomalies.  
Most of these TEFs are the Type C. You still need to verify which type of TEF it is because the anesthesia management is not the same for the less frequent occurring TEFs.

**_The hardest part of the case is the beginning._**  
**  
Anesthesia Goals: (Type C - most common -_TE Fistula above carina)_**  
\- IV or inhalation induction while maintaining spontaneous respirations.  
\- Avoid positive pressure ventilation until the fistula is clamped.  
\- Precisely intubate either just below the esophageal fistula, or a left maintstem intubation isolating the right lung.  
\- Avoid gastric distension (from ventilator via ETT); This may cause compromise the pulmonary system and surgeons view.  
\- Patient needs to maintain adequate oxygenation/ventilation (especially for a thoracoscopic procedure).  
\- Once the fistula is clamped and gases cannot reach and distend the stomach, you may paralyze the neonate and ventilate the left lung. The surgeon will let you know.  
\- Maintain one lung ventilation until the surgeon says it is OK to pull the ETT back above the carina.

**Be aware for additional Risks:**  
Coexisting complex congenital heart disease (CHD)  
Weight <2 kg  
Poor pulmonary compliance  
Large pericarinal fistulas (> 3mm)  
Thoracoscopic approach

**Pre-op-** **Communication is critical between you and the surgeon  
**There are a variety of ways a surgeon may approach to repair a TEF.

The most popular approach to a TEF appears to be a right thoracoscopy involving a left mainstem intubation isolating the right lung. These are hectic cases as mentioned at the top of the page. You may not be able to left mainstem the patient and generally the surgeon can work around this.  
**Note:** Bronchial Tube Blockers and DLTs require a larger ETT.

**Fogarty Catheter (Antegrade occlusion of a TEF)**  
If you are lucky, your surgeon will utilize an older method to seal the fistula in the beginning of the case. A Fogarty Catheter can be inserted into the esophageal fistula via rigid bronchoscope in the beginning of the case (antegrade occlusion of the fistula). Once the Fogarty balloon is inflated, the communication between the trachea and esophageal fistula is now temporarily blocked. You will now be permitted to relax and ventilate the infant without insufflating the stomach. Occlusion of the fistula with a Fogarty catheter has been used effectively in patients with large, distal fistula and poor lung compliance.  
Unfortunately, many surgeons avoid this method because the Fogarty Catheters are challenging to insert and may potentially dislodge, causing a central airways obstruction.

Your patient may still experience desaturations and hypotension from the physiological changes from a thoracoscopy and one lung ventilation. Fortunately, these negative physiologic effects are not as drastic as the previous method. Some smaller neonates may not tolerate the left mainstem intubation, and isolating the right lung may have to be abandoned.  
  
**Review the neonate’s chart**  
Look for diagnosed associated anomalies, particularly cardiac, musculoskeletal, and GI defects, which occur in 30% to 50% of patients.

All labs, CXR etc  
  
**Is there an anomaly associated?**  
Cardiac and lung status are your main concern. Consider an A-line if any are compromised.

**Is it a Staged Procedure?**

If primary esophageal anastomosis is not possible due to a large gap between the proximal and distal esophagus, a second stage may be delayed until 6-12 months of age. A procedure called a “Colon Interposition” will later be performed using a segment of colon as a bridge to anastomose the proximal and distal esophagus.  
Cardiac reasons or poor lung status may also cause the procedure to be staged.

**IV Access  
**Does the neonate have a UAC (Umbilical Arterial Catheter) and/or a UVC (Umbilical Venous Catheter)?  
If they do, that is good and bad news. Good news because you already have good arterial and venous access. Bad news because UACs are commonly utilized for patients with known cardiac defects.  
UAC is a free A-line and you should use it.  
The UVP is your free central line.  
  
If, not, consider 1 large bore IV. Generally they are already on D10 or a dextrose based MIVF. It is good to continue this to avoid sudden drops in blood sugar. A push port can be placed low in the IV to bolus medication or fluid.

**Where does the surgeon want the ETT placed?**  
For a Typed C, the ETT is usually placed in the left mainstem to isolate the right lung. These neonates are too small for a DLT.  
It all depends where the TEF is. Most are distal esophageal fistulas connecting just 2 tracheal rings above the carina.  
Some literate states to have an air leak up to 25cmH2O around the ETT to prevent gastric distension and post extubation laryngeal edema.  
Although it is unusual to intubate the fistula, it has been reported and must be avoided. Keeping the bevel of the ETT anterior and downward during intubation may reduce the risk of intubating the fistula.

**Does the surgeon want a Bronchoscopy?  
**Most surgeons will want to perform a rigid or flexible bronchoscopy before intubation to verify the fistula location and to check for tracheomalacia.  
Also, there is always a small potential for two fistulas. The complications from an unrecognized, unrepaired fistula could be troublesome. The surgeon also needs to identify the present anatomy prior to any surgical repair. You will need to maintain spontaneous ventilation and avoid PPV during the bronchoscopy.  
A small fiberoptic bronchoscope may be utilized to verify appropriate ETT placement.

**Warning:** There is an abnormally high incidence of a small cricoid ring, which may complicate the intubation.

**Is it an open or a thoracoscopic procedure?  
**Thoracoscopic procedures are now the more popular approaches to repair a TEF.A-lines were once 100% mandatory for these thoracoscopic procedures. Now it depends more on the patient’s cardiac condition and anesthesia provider’s comfort zone.  
**  
Thoracoscopic Physiological Changes  
**This is when you may be challenged the most. You may be battling severe desaturations and hypotension while maintaining spontaneous respirations.Significant physiologic changes with the thoracoscopic approach can be crucial in all neonates and especially in those with cardiac defects and compromised lungs.  
**Right-sided thoracoscopy with insufflation will cause:**_  
Direct compression of vena cava and right atrium  
Reduces venous return  
Reduces Cardiac index  
Reduces MAP mean arterial blood pressure  
Carbon dioxide absorption from the CO2 insufflation may result in poorly tolerated  
hypercarbia and acidosis_

You need to remember that it is common for neonates/infants to desaturate with insufflation of right pleural cavity (with CO2 insufflation pressures of 4-6 mmHg) with the collapsing of right lung. Isolating the right lung offers the surgeon a superior view. You may consider increasing the FIO2to 1.0 and utilize gentle hand ventilation to maintain SaO2 > 85%. Aggressive PPV should be avoided as it can lead to gastric distension and limit the surgeon’s thoracoscopic view.  
**  
One lung ventilation and ETCO2  
**Collapsing (isolating) the right lung offers the surgeon a superior view.One-lung ventilation increases pulmonary vascular resistance through hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.During one-lung ventilation, the ETCO2 may be falsely low, and an ABG should be drawn (if you have an A-line) to compare the ETCO2 reading. Titrate the ventilation accordingly.  
The ventilation can be difficult to monitor due to frequently inaccurate or absent ECO2 during esophageal anastomosis. With CO2 insufflation, arterial blood gases commonly reveal increased arterial CO2 and reduced pH.  
One-lung ventilation increases pulmonary vascular resistance through hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.

**Lung Status**  
Is there aspiration pneumonia?  
How is their pulmonary compliance?  
Is the patient on a ventilator.  
Patients with poor pulmonary compliance are at a greater risk of gastric insufflation.  
However, during spontaneous respirations, there is little gastric insufflation, even with poor lung compliance. Instituting PPV imposes this risk; particularly with pulmonary pathology.  
Consider an A-line for a neonate with poor lung status compliance.  
Fortunately, congenital TEF/EA usually present with minimal lung pathology and excellent lung compliance.  
  

**How large is the Pericarina Fistula?**  
If the bronchoscopy reveals a large (>3 mm), pericarinal fistula, the patient is more prone to gastric distention. Especially if combined with poor lung compliance.  
  
**Is the neonate stable?  
**Some of these neonates can be very premature and < 2kg.  
Some of these cases can be emergent for those already being mechanically ventilated to minimize aspiration pneumonia.  
There is a poor prognosis in infants with TEF/TE correlating with prematurity and underlying lung disease as well as coexistence of other congenital anomalies.

**Is there a Gastrostomy Tube?**  
Traditionally, TEF /EA was managed by a staged procedure. Unfortunately, a gastronomy may cause further ventilatory instability, as it provides a low-pressure leak via a ‘bronchocutaneous’ fistula, with resultant ineffective ventilation.  
Cardiac arrests has been reported from severe gastric distension which has impinged on diaphragmatic excursion during PPV- without a gastrostomy.  
Also, an acute gastric distension can be relieved with needle aspiration or emergent gastrostomy tube.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT and maintain spontaneous ventilation (avoid PPV). Ketamine and precedex are great for this.  
**Isolate Right lung:** Usually  
**Regional:** Jaffe says epidural, this is very rare**Pre-oxygenate:** Yes, for at least 2-3 minutes**0.02mg/kg Atropine or 0.01mg/kg Robinul:** Yes, to prevent bradycardia prior to suctioning and direct laryngoscopy for kids < 10 months.  
**Suction out the esophageal pouch:** Yes, most of the time the neonate already has a red rubber suction catheter positioned in the pouch on continuous suction. Leave it in until the surgeon asks you to withdraw while anastomosing the esophagus.  
**Induction:** Inhalation or IV while maintaining spontaneous respirations.  
**Intubation:** Usually a 3.0-3.5 ETT. There is an abnormally high incidence of a small cricoid ring which may complicate the intubation.  
Although it is unusual to intubate the fistula, it has been reported so be careful. Keeping the bevel of the tube anterior and downward during intubation may reduce the risk of intubating the fistula which is usually above the carina. It is also important to permit an air leak at about 20-25 cm of H 2 O around the ETT. If the tube is too tight, subglottic edema may occur with post-extubation "croup" and subglottic stenosis.

**Muscle Relaxation:** No, you must maintain spontaneous respirations until the fistula is clamped. Always check with the surgeon. After the fistula is clamped, a muscle relaxant will be helpful during the esophageal anastomosis by eliminating diaphragmatic movements.  
**Nitrous:** No, it may aggravate gastric distension.  
**Ventilation:** Substitute PPV with gentle hand ventilation until the fistula is clamped as needed. Too much may cause gastric distention.  
**ETCO2:** May be absent and inaccurate at times.  
**FIO:** Literature states to avoid a high FIO2 in neonates. This task may be difficult when the SaO2 is in < 80%.  
**Remifenanil drip (optional)** can be utilized while maintaining spontaneous ventilation  
0.05-0.1mcg/kg/min for spontaneous respiations.  
**Fentanyl** 5-10mcg/kg/hr  
**Ketamine (optional)** Small boluses as needed (mild respiratory stimulant) good for bronchoscopy to maintain spontaneous ventilation  
**Precedex drip** (Optional) good for bronchoscopy to maintain spontaneous ventilation  
**Bronchoscopy:** Yes, beginning of the case.  
**Intubation:** Usually a left mainstem to isolate the right lung**Thoracoscopic –** Usually a with one lung ventilation (right lung is usually isolated)  
**Open Procedure-** Ask the surgeon  
**Type and Cross:** Yes**Blood available:** Usually not needed.**IV Status:** 1 large bore.  
**Hydration: 4:2:1 (below is just a common reference)  
**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**A-Line:** If cardiac defect or poor lung status is present.  
Not all thoracotomies require an A-line.  
These are NICU patients and may already have a UAC or UVC or both.  
**Temperature Probe:** Remove it along with the red rubber suction catheters  
**Position** : Usually left lateral or modified left lateral for a right posterolateral incision. Surgical side is always the opposite of the side of the aortic arch. 2.5% of the time the aortic arch will be on the left side requiring a right lateral with the left side up for a left posterolateral incision.  
The surgeon should confirm the aortic arch position.  
**Semi-prone position:** sometimes  
**Supine:** For Gastrostomy  
**Duration:** 2-4 hours  
**EBL:** 10mg/kg

**Foley Catheter:** yes, long case**Emergence:** Extubate if possible. Patients with poor lung status may remain intubated.Postoperative management requires an intensive care setting. Tracheal extubation may be complicated by poor pain control, tracheomalacia and vocal cord paresis among others. Depending on preference, the neonate may remain intubated for transport back to NICU/PICU to be extubated there. No reversal is generally needed, but keep in mind the need to extubate in the ICU environment and try not to paralyze for transport.

**Gentle Suctioning:** Prior to extubation, use only GENTLE suctioning of the trachea and esophagus, especially near the areas that were just sutured.

**Possible Complications:**  
Hemorrhage  
Hypothermia  
Metabolic acidosis  
Hypo-or hyperventilation  
Aspiration  
Pneumothorax  
Severe Hypoxia  
Severe gastric distention requiring emergency gastrostomy or needle aspiration  
Life-threatening gastric rupture  
Atelectasis  
Mucus Plug  
Recurrent fistula  
Dysphagia  
GERD 50%  
Tracheomalacia  
Bronchial hyper-reactivity  
Esophageal strictures 10-15%  
Disruption of the esophageal anastomosis

**Associated risk during the TE repair  
**ET tube might inadvertently enter the fistula during repositioning the infant during manipulation  
  
Difficult ventilation, decreasing levels of oxygen saturation and ETCO2 monitors are the first indicators.
