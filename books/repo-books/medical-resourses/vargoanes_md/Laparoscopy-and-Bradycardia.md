Laparoscopy and Bradycardia     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Laparoscopy and Bradycardia

**Pneumoperitoneum** At the beginning of the procedure, the abdomen is inflated with carbon dioxide gas to provide a working and viewing space for the surgeon (pneumoperitoneum). CO2 is the gas of choice because it is noncombustible, highly soluble, and readily eliminated through the lungs. 

**Bradycardia with Pneumoperitoneum**  
In a small subset (0.5%) of otherwise healthy patients, severe bradycardia and asystole can occur during CO2 insufflation and pneumoperitoneum.  
With any Laparoscopic procedure, visualization of the peritoneal cavity is usually assisted by a pneumoperitoneum that distends and separates the abdominal wall from its contents. Unfortunately, the pneumoperitoneum increases intra-abdominal pressure (IAP). The excessive stretching of the peritoneum may produce bradycardia via a vagal reflex. Immediately inform the surgeon and he/she will deflate the abdomen. Most of the time the bradycardia will quickly resolve with deflation alone. It is also common practice to administer 0.2mg of Robinul or some Atropine before the surgeon re-inflates the abdomen, after the heart rate returns to baseline.  
This is not a rare of an occurrence with laparoscopic procedures; you could see it once a week if you do lots of laparoscopic cases. Be prepared.

**See “Laparoscopic Physiologic Responses” Monitor the Heart Rate Volume (tone)** You should be able to audibly hear the heart rate tone with every heart beat, especially during the initial pneumoperitoneum. Not being able to quickly assess and treat the bradycardia could be detrimental. Tell the circulating RN to turn the satellite radio down! Any surgeon worth their salt will let you keep your audio volume high during insufflation; and you could still perform your other tasks without having to be looking directly at the monitor.

**Bed Positioning**You may be asked to position the bed in Trendelenburg or Reverse Trendelenburg. This will anatomically shift the abdominal contents out of the surgeon’s way for a better view. Always make sure your patient has a safety strap on. This is especially important with lateral tilts (as seen with a laparoscopic cholecystectomy).
