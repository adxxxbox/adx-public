### Dental Extractions and Restorations (Adults)

We don't see many of these patients in hospital-based anesthesia settings unless the patient obviously has enough issues not to be done at a dental office. Most of the time the dentist will bring his/her own staff and equipment.

**Pre-op:** Find out if the surgeon will permit you to use an Oral Rae. Oral intubations (instead of nasal) are more accepted in adults than kids for dentistry.  
**Anesthetic:** General/Oral Rae or Nasal ETT.  
**Muscle Relaxant:** Not needed.  
**Position:** Supine, arms tucked with a donut to keep the head secure.   
**Intubation:** If using an Oral Rae, tape it in the middle below the lower lip for the dentist.  
If a nasal intubation is planned, don’t forget your Magill forceps and Neo-synephrine or Afrin nasal spray.  
**Antisialogogue:** Yes, Robinul.  
**Narcotics:** Minimal, the dentist usually localizes very well.  
**Increases in HR:** Yes, the dentist’s local has Epinephrine; so don’t start giving narcotics with an increased HR after the local injection. An increase in HR is a common SE of using SQ Epi, so don’t freak out. If you are bothered by a heart rate of 120 in a young adult, give some Esmolol. I see some of my younger colleagues doing this all the time and my advice to them is: **_Don’t treat tachycardia with narcotics if the patient is under a good General Anesthetic unless you are sure that the patient is experiencing pain._**

**Throat pack:** Yes, and don’t forget to make sure the pack is removed prior to emergence. When the throat pack is removed, hand the surgeon an OGT to empty the stomach. Most are nice enough to pass the OGT down for you.  
**Antiemetics:** Yes  
**EBL:** Minimal, but clear the airway out really well before you extubate. Chances are the patient will have gauze pads to bite on to cut down the bleeding so protect those cords!  
**Emergence:**  
Deep extubation is OK if you feel comfortable.  Many CRNAs put in a nasal airway. However, we are taught in training to always perform awake extubations for these cases.
