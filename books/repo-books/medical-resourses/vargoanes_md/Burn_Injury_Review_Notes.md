**Burn Injury Review Notes**

_(AANA Journal, Kimmy Harbin CRNA and Teresa Norris CRNA)_

Burn injury is a leading cause of life-threatening trauma worldwide, affecting more than 450,000 Americans each year, and is associated with an average mortality rate of 0.8%.

Anesthetic management for burn surgery can be challenging because of difficult airway management lack of vascular access, and physiologic derangements due to massive destruction of tissues that affect virtually all organ systems and alter patient response to anesthetic agents.

**The risk of death from burn injury increases with:**  
Advancing age  
Increasing burn size  
Presence of inhalation injury.

Burns involving the face, airway, or genitalia are also classified as major burn injuries regardless of the percentage of TBSA affected.

**Pathophysiology of Major Burn Injury**  
Major burns cause massive tissue destruction and activation of an inflammatory response that leads to dramatic system wide physiologic derangements.

**Burn injury pathophysiology evolves in 2 distinct phases:**  
Burn shock phase  
Hypermetabolic phase (follow burn shock phase)

Acute burn injury results in an area of necrosis surrounded by ischemic tissues that may potentially become viable if adequate perfusion is restored. Within minutes to hours of injury, burned tissues release inflammatory and vasoactive mediators that increase capillary permeability and cause localized burn wound edema.  
  
**These mediators are:**  
Histamine  
Prostaglandins  
Kinins  
Thromboxane  
Nitric oxide  
  
Subsequent reperfusion of ischemic tissues produces reactive oxygen species- toxic cell metabolites that cause further cellular membrane dysfunction and propagation of the immune response.

Burn shock Phase  
Hypermetabolic Phase (follow burn shock phase)

**Burn Shock Phase**  
In addition to the local effects of burn injury, major burns cause the release of circulating mediators such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukins that result in a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Within 6 to 8 hours of injury, increased microvascular permeability, vasodilatation, vascular stasis, decreased cardiac contractility, and reduced cardiac output result in massive edema formation in both injured and noninjured tissues. A massive leak of fluid and electrolytes from the intravascular space into the interstitial space, combined with fluid losses through drainage and evaporation from burn wounds, further impairs tissue perfusion. Rapid and effective intravascular volume replacement is critical to the prevention of burn shock, a combination of distributive, hypovolemic, and cardiogenic shock, in which plasma volume is insufficient to maintain preload or cardiac output and tissue hypoperfusion ensues. Failure to adequately replace intravascular volume can lead to significant organ injury from systemic inflammatory responses and multiorgan dysfunction. In the event that fluid resuscitation is successful, a pronounced hypermetabolic response develops over several days to weeks
