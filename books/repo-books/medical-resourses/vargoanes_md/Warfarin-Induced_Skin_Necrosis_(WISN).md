### Warfarin-Induced Skin Necrosis (WISN)

WISN is a potentially catastrophic complication of warfarin therapy that arises as a consequence of the different half-lives of the vitamin K-dependent proteins.  
  
One day after initiation of usual doses of warfarin, protein C activity is reduced by approximately 50%.  
Owing to their longer half-lives, the levels of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, IX, and X decline more slowly (factor VII activity declines at approximately the same rate as protein C).  
  
The reduced level of protein C activity relative to these other procoagulant molecules with longer half-lives (prothrombin is 42 hours) creates a transient hypercoagulable state.  
  
This effect is more pronounced when large loading doses of warfarin are administered.  
Indeed, WISN typically occurs during the first few days of warfarin therapy, often when daily doses are greater than 10 mg.  
Heparin should be co-administered to avoid WISN.
