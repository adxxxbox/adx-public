# Pitocin

**Pitocin (Oxytocin)**  
A natural hormone that facilitates the parturition or birth.  
We use the synthetic form.  
**Anesthesia Indications:** C-sec right after the cord is clamped-to prevent postpartum hemorrhage.  
**Doses:**  
Supplied - One 1 mL vial (10units)  
It is standard to put 20 units( 2 vials) of Pitocin in 1,000mL bag of NS or LR.  
Right after the cord is clamped, run the first bag of 20 units wide open followed by a 2nd bag (also 20 units) slowly.  
Sometimes the OB/GYN will ask you to put more in the bag.  
If the c-section involves twins. Wait until after the second baby is out.  
**CONTRAINDICATIONS**  
Presence of a second fetus  
  
**Drug Interactions**  
Other vasopressors may potentiate hypertension.  
**Other Notes:**  
It stimulates uterine smooth muscle contractions indirectly and helps expedite the normal contractions of spontaneous labor. As in all significant uterine contractions, there is a transient reduction in uterine blood flow.  
It also stimulates the mammary glands to increase lactation without increasing the production of milk. The drug is administered in the pre-hospital setting to control postpartum bleeding.  
  
**Antepartum:**  
Stimulates rhythmic contractions of the uterus.  
Increases the frequency of existing contractions.  
Raises the tone of the uterine musculature.  
  
**Postpartum**  
To produce uterine contractions during the third stage of labor and to control postpartum bleeding or hemorrhage.  
  
**Anaphylactic Reactions**  
Postpartum hemorrhage  
Cardiac arrhythmia and PVCs  
Fatal afibrinogenemia  
Hypertensive episodes  
Nausea  
Vomiting  
Pelvic hematoma  
Subarachnoid hemorrhage
