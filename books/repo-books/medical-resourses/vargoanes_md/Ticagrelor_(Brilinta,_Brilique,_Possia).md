Ticagrelor (Brilinta, Brilique, Possia)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Ticagrelor (Brilinta, Brilique, Possia)

Antiplatelet Agent  
**ADP Antagonist** and also considered a **P2Y12 receptor antagonist.**  
Ticagrelor is a reversible platelet inhibitor, meaning platelet function normalizes after drug clearance and NOT the life-span of the platelets.  
  
BRILINTA ® (ticagrelor) is the first and only oral antiplatelet (OAP) in a chemical class called cyclo-pentyl-triazolo-pyrimidine.  
Taken PO 60 or 90 mg capsules.  
  
**Indications**  
To reduce the rate of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of myocardial infarction (MI).  
For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel.  
Also reduces the rate of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS.  
  
**Monitor:** ADP antagonist are considered reliable and not routinely monitored, unlike heparin and warfarin. There is no therapeutic drug monitoring widely available for P2Y12 antagonists, in contrast with warfarin (INR) and heparin (aPTT).  
  
**Any test that measures platelet functionality can be used.**  
Verify-Now P2Y12 \[PRU Test\])  
PRP Aggregation  
P2Y12 Assay  
Whole blood aggregation  
TEGs-unreliable  
  
There are also tests to identify patient’s CYP2C19 genotype  
P2Y12 platelet receptor cascade tests (Verify-Now P2Y12 \[PRU Test\])  
  
Ticagrelor is a reversible inhibitor, so platelet function normalizes after drug clearance.  
Circulating drug or active metabolites can inhibit transfused platelets.  
  
**Mechanism of Action**  
Reversibly and noncompetitively binds the ADP P2Y 12 receptor on the platelet surface which prevents ADP-mediated activation of the GPIIb/IIIa receptor complex thereby reducing platelet aggregation.  
  
Due to the reversible antagonism of the P2Y 12 receptor, recovery of platelet function is likely to depend on serum concentrations of ticagrelor and its active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent.  
  
In contrast to the other antiplatelet drugs, ticagrelor has a binding site different from ADP, making it an allosteric antagonist, and the blockage is reversible.  
Due to the reversible antagonism of the P2Y 12 receptor, recovery of platelet function is likely to depend on serum concentrations of ticagrelor and its active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent.  
  
**Onset  
**Ticagrelor, a reversible and direct-acting oral antagonist of the adenosine diphosphate receptor P2Y12, provides faster, greater, and more consistent P2Y12 inhibition than clopidogrel.  
  
Inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA): 180 mg loading dose: ~41% within 30 minutes (similar to clopidogrel 600 mg at 8 hours).  
**Peak effect:** Time to maximal IPA: 180 mg loading dose: IPA ~88% at 2 hours post administration.  
Time to Peak  
_Whole tablets:_ Parent drug: 1.5 hours (median; range: 1 to 4 hours); Active metabolite (AR-C124910XX): 2.5 hours (median; range: 1.5 to 5 hours)  
  
**Absorption:** Rapid  
**Half-life:** is 7 hours for parent drug and 9 hours for the active metabolite.  
  
**Metabolism:  
**Hepatic via CYP3A4/5 to active metabolite (AR-C124910XX).  
Ticagrelor does not need hepatic activation, which might work better for patients with genetic variants regarding the enzyme CYP2C19 (although it is not certain whether clopidogrel is significantly influenced by such variants).  
  
**Excretion:**  
Feces (58%); urine (26%); actual amount of parent drug and active metabolite excreted in urine was <1% of total dose administered.  
**Liver or Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustments required.  
  
**Ticagrelor vs Clopidogrel**  
Ticagrelor is known to act faster and has a shorter duration than clopidogrel.  
This means it has to be taken twice instead of once a day which is a disadvantage in respect of compliance, but its effects are more quickly reversible which can be useful before surgery or if side effects occur.
