Protein S Deficiency    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Protein S Deficiency

Protein S deficiencies are associated with thrombosis mostly in the venous system.  
  
Protein S deficiency may be acquired via hepatic diseases.  
It may also be hereditary.  
  
**Manifestations of Protein S deficiency**  
Usually manifests clinically as venous thromboembolism (VTE).  
Any arterial thrombosis appears coincidental or weak at best.  
Patients with protein S deficiency without thrombosis DO NOT require prophylactic treatment.  
  
**Epidemiology  
**Mean age of first thrombosis is in the second decade of life.  
Males and females are equally affected.  
  
**Risk Factors  
**Oral contraceptives, pregnancy and the use of hormone replacement therapy increase the risk venous thrombosis in patients with protein S deficiency.  
  
Patients with protein S deficiency and another prothrombotic state such as factor V Leiden or the prothrombotic 20210 mutation have increased rates of thrombosis.  
  
**Warfarin-Induced Skin Necrosis (WISN)**  
Patients heterozygous for protein S deficiency who are begun on warfarin without concomitant heparin can develop warfarin-induced skin necrosis because the half-life of prothrombin, another vitamin K-dependent clotting factor, is much longer than protein S (42 hours). These patients develop extremely low levels of protein S relative to prothrombin and develop necrosis of the skin over central areas of the body such as the breast, abdomen, buttocks and genitalia.  
  
**Pregnancy considerations:** protein S deficiency increases thrombotic risk.  
  
**Genetics  
**Autosomal dominant.  
Arterial thrombosis is more frequent among smokers with protein S deficiency.  
Homozygotes can have a fulminant thrombotic event in infancy, termed neonatal purpora fulminans.  
  
**Labs**  
Free protein S antigen can be measured by a monoclonal antibody technique.  
Coagulation assay for protein S activity.  
  
**General Measures and Treatment  
**Routine anticoagulation for asymptomatic patients.  
After first thrombosis: anticoagulation for 6-12 months.  
Some data suggests lifetime anticoagulation.  
  
**Medications  
**LWMH: Enoxaparin (Lovenox).  
Alternatively, 1.5mg/kg Sub Q per day for at least 5 days or until INR is 2-3 at which time it can be stopped.
