### Volvulus and Malrotation Repair Anesthesia

**Ladd's Procedure (Repair of Malrotation or Midgut Volvulus)**

_Edited by Brian Del Grosso CRNA, Carolinas Medical Center, Charlotte, NC_

These cases are usually listed as “Exploratory Laparoscopy with possible Ladd's Procedure.”

Anesthetically, this is similar to a laparoscopic bowel obstruction procedure.

Most Ladd's procedures are being performed laparoscopically on infants, children, and adults who have intestinal malrotation without midgut volvulus. If the procedure is started laparoscopically, it is also possible to be converted to an open procedure if a bowel resection needs to be done. This is ultimately surgeon preference & skill.

**Many are diagnosed the first week of life.**  
60% present in the first month of life  
20% present between 1 month and 1 year of age  
20% after 1 year.  
  
**Possible Pre-op Symptoms:**  
Bilious or bloody vomiting  
Hemodynamic instability due to sepsis  
Tender and distended abdomen due to episodes of intermittent duodenal obstruction caused by intestinal bands  
Dehydration - usually resolved with IV hydration.  
Rectal bleeding - a sign that the bowel has been compromised and may indicate that the infant has a gangrenous bowel.

**Labs:** How are the electrolytes?  
It is possible to see falsely elevated Hct secondary to intravascular depletion if the patient has not properly rehydrated.

**Ladd's Surgical Procedure**

This is the gold standard of treatment for intestinal malrotation.  
The procedure involves excision of the Ladd Bands so that the mesentery can be released allowing the intestines to relax unrestrained and unobstructed.  
Unfortunately, the bowel will remain in the backwards position permanently in turn making it more difficult to diagnose appendicitis later in life.  
Due to this intestinal malrotation, the surgeon will usually perform an appendectomy at this time.

The procedure is named after Dr. William Ladd (1880-1967).

**Surgery For Vovulus**

When a volvulus is present, the surgeon wants to gain immediate access to the abdomen to untwist the intestine by rotating the bowel counterclockwise.

After the volvulus is immediately reduced, the intestines are closely observed for several minutes to verify bowel viability.  
If the bowel does not regain some normality before the end of the procedure (i.e color change to indicate improved blood flow), the surgeon will resect the necrotic portions.

**Anesthetic Concerns  
Respiratory** : Aspiration risk and increased work of breathing. Abdominal distention can impede diaphragmatic movement and also increase the aspiration risk.

**Hypovolemia:** Due to peritonitis, bowel manipulation, ilieus and sepsis. Adequate hydration is imperative.  
**Electrolyte impairment** : This is a true emergency case, expect to replete electrolytes in the operating room.  
  
**Pre-op:  
Labs:** How are the electrolytes? Expect to see false elevation of Hct secondary to intravascular depletion.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
**Induction:** RSI  
**Position** : Supine  
**Epidural for post op pain:** Rare  
**Induction:** RSI  
**Nitrous Oxide:** NO  
**IV Access:** 2 large bore or central line, most of these patients have a pre-existing IV.  
**Hydration: 4:2:1 (below is just a common reference)  
**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**A-line** : +/-, dependent upon the severity of the patient

Aggressive fluid replacement and replacement of third space extracellular fluid loss is advised.

**OGT/NGT:** Yes, one should have already been inserted, place on suction prior and/or during induction to prevent aspiration.  
**Duration:** 1-3 hours  
**EBL:** usually minimal  
**T&C:** Preferred; commonly bleeding is present. Have PRBC's readily available.

**Emergence:  
**It is common to not extubate these neonates and transport them back to the NICU.

**Possible Complications:**  
Hemorrhage  
Aspiration  
Re-obstruction  
Infection secondary to translocation of bacteria from intestinal tract

Bowel ischemia can cause severe hemodynamic instability. May need inotropes and/or volume.
