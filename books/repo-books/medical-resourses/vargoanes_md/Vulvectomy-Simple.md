Vulvectomy - Simple     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Vulvectomy - Simple

This is the removal of the labia majora, the labia minora, and possibly the clitoris as well as the perianal area.

Unlike radical vulvectomy, this simpler procedure does not require an incision all the way to the perineal fascia and removal of neighboring lymph nodes.  

**Anesthetic:** General/LMA  
Spinal: Rare, but optional.

**Duration:**  1 hour

**EBL:** 20-50mLs

**Position:** Lithotomy

**BP:** Mild hypotension (with 20% of their base BP) to limit bleeding. That area is vascular.

**Foley Catheter:** Yes

**Indication:** For severe lesions of the vulva that are not amenable to local excision or other forms of conservative therapy. These conditions include extensive in situ or micro-invasional carcinoma of the vulva, Paget's disease, and severe leukoplakia.

**Possible Complications**  
Bleeding  
Infection
