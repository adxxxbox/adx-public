# Anticholinesterase Facts

**Edrophonium vs Neostigmine**  
Edrophonium works at the anionic site. This makes it much faster than Neostigmine.  
Edrophonium works in about 3 minutes, and neostigmine works in about 8 minutes.  
Both Edrophonium and Neostigmine are quaternary ammonium structures. With Edrophonium, there is an acetylcholine enzyme that eventually breaks it down. With Neostigmine, there is a carbamylated enzyme that eventually breaks it down. So they're broken down differently.  
Edrophonium is 75% renally cleared.  
You want to give atropine with Edrophonium because their onsets match up better. For the same reason, you want to give Neostigmine with Glycopyrrolate (Robinul).  
**Anticholinesterase Over Dose:**  
Most of them are not that big of a deal, except when you don't add enough anticholinergics for the muscarinic receptors and increase peristalsis leading to a BM as they are waking up.  
In the central nervous system, if you keep giving anticholinesterases, you can get confusion, seizures, coma, and respiratory depression.  
**Treatment for Anticholinesterase Over Dose:**  
Treat with an anticholinergic. The most widely used is Atropine. Give 35-70 ug/kg IV q3-10 minutes until the muscarinic effects disappear. Also, take care of ABCs.  
**Other Clinical Uses of Anticholinesterase Drugs** For the diagnosis and treatment of myasthenia gravis  
Tensilon test (using edrophonium)  
Evaluate the presence of dual blockade by succinylcholine (Phase II block).  
Treatment of the CNS effects produced by certain drugs.  
Treatment of Glaucoma  
Treatment of paralytic-ilius and antony of the bladder
