### Urinary Diversions

**What is a Urinary Diversion?**  
When the bladder is removed, the ureters need to be surgically connected to some type of urinary diversion to drain urine. There are many types of diversions and they take a few hours to create.

**Ileal Conduit (Urostomy)**  
The oldest and simplest form of urinary diversion.  
Ureters are attached to a portion of the small intestine, the ileum, one end of which is brought through the abdominal wall as a conduit for the urine, creating a stoma. Unfortunately the patient requires a urostomy bag to collect the urine. 

**Ureterosigmoidostomy**  
The ureters are attached to a portion of the large intestine, the sigmoid, which allows the urine to flow through the large intestine and out through the rectum.  
  
**Cutaneous ureterostomy**  
Bringing the detached ureters through the abdominal wall and attaching it to an opening in the skin.

**Mainz 2 Procedure (Recto-sigmoid pouch)**  
This is a newer type of urinary diversion. The surgeon makes a rectal pouch by adding a piece of bowel taken from the upper colon. He then attaches the ureters to the pouch. The pouch collects the urine and the patient uses their anal sphincter to hold it in.  
After this operation, the patient passes urine out with the stools from the rectal pouch.
