### Fire-Intraoperative (airway and non-airway)

**_Airway Fire_**

Components known as the “fire triad”:  
**Oxidizer** (oxygen and nitrous oxide)  
**Ignition source:** (electrosurgical devices, lasers, burrs and drills, and fiberoptic scopes)  
**Fuel:** ETT, NC, masks, sponges/gauzes, alcohol-containing solutions and drapes

**High-risk procedures include, but are not limited to:**  
Tonsillectomy.  
Tracheostomy.  
Removal of laryngeal papillomas.  
Cataract or other eye surgery.  
Burr hole surgery.  
Removal of lesions on the head, neck or face .

**Airway Fire  
**Stop Flow of all airway gases (disconnect the breathing circuit-it is much quicker then dialing down the gas flow dials).  
Extubate and maintain airway patency while telling someone to call “Anesthesia stat.”  
Others OR staff should be removing sponges and any other flammable material from the airway.

**While you are maintaining a patent airway:**  
OR staff should pour saline into the airway,  
Removing drapes and all burning flammable material,  
Extinguish burning materials by pouring saline or other means.

**What if the Fire is Still not out?**  
Call for a CO2 and a ABC extinguisher stat (CO2 extinguisher is your first choice),  
  
**If CO2 extinguisher is unsuccessful:  
**Use the ABC extinguisher.  
Tell someone to activate fire alarm.  
Evacuate the patient if feasible, follow your institutional protocols.  
Close the door to the room to contain the fire, and do not reopen it or attempt to reenter the room.  
Tell someone to close off the gas in the supply room.

**After Fire is out:  
**Re-establish ventilation with 21% until you are certain there is nothing left burning in the airway then switch to 100% O2.  
Avoid Nitrous.  
Examine the airway and ETT for injury and to see if fragments were left behind.  
Consider rigid bronchoscopy.

**_Non-Airway Fire_**

(DO NOT EXTUBATE)  
Stop flow of all airway gases.  
Remove drapes and all burning flammable material.  
Extinguish burning materials by pouring saline or other means.

**If fire is not out on the First Attempt:**  
Call for a CO2 and an ABC extinguisher stat (CO2 extinguisher is your first choice).

**If CO2 extinguisher is unsuccessful:  
**Use the ABC extinguisher.  
Tell someone to activate fire alarm.  
Evacuate the patient – the follow your institutional protocols.  
Close the OR Door.  
Tell someone to close off the gas in the supply room.

**After the Fire is OUT:  
**Maintain ventilation.  
Assess patient for burn injury.  
If it is a MAC case, check for inhalation injury.  
Make sure the fire did not spread.
