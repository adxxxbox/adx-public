Anterior Cervical Discectomy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Anterior Cervical Discectomy

  
An anterior approach through the front of the neck in order to relieve spinal cord or nerve root pressure and alleviate corresponding pain, weakness, numbness and tingling. This is done by surgically removing the offending disc. It is a form of decompression.  
The anterior approach is more convenient than a posterior approach behind the neck.

The anterior approach can provide access to almost the entire cervical spine.

**Pre-op:**  
Assess the patient’s cervical ROM. If the ROM is limited due to pain, be prepared to use a glide scope. Have your airway plan set for all the possibilities: Glidescope, flexible Gum bougie, Macintosh and Miller blades, suction on and ready.

**Anesthesia:** General, ETT  
Possibly an Elective Glide Scope Intubation.  
**_Document that you intubated with the head in neutral position._**  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Depends on what your surgeon wants.  Your colleagues who know the surgeon’s preferences could inform you ahead of time. If not, just ask the surgeon.     
  
 Consider using one of those small flexible tube extenders while removing the anesthesia circuit’s elbow piece. That little flex tube can be manipulated like an accordion. This permits you to position the ETT and circuit just above the patient’s face towards you and out of the surgeon’s way. Also, position your Xmas tree or anesthesia tubing circuit holder behind the patient’s head so it is also out of the surgeon’s way.

**Position:** Supine with tucked arms. Make sure you have a secure pulse ox and the tracing looks accurate. Tape it to the finger if necessary and assure that you have a good flowing IV. Attach your Neo drip to the distal port in your IV tubing.  
  
**BP Cuff Location:** Consider the nearest leg. Many times the BP cuff will give erroneous BP readings from the surgeon or scrub assistant leaning against it.    
  
Sometimes we connect a Neosynephrine drip in case we feel we may need one. Once the patient’s arms are tucked, getting access to the arms will be an inconvenience to access.

The surgeon and assistant will be closely occupying both sides of the patient.

**Required Meds**: Nothing specific. Whatever it takes for a smooth emergence. You do not want the patient coughing.  
Ofirmev 1,000 mg is becoming popular and replacing Toradol for non-narcotic analgesia.  
 

**Blood loss:** Minimal  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours

**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable. Remember, arms will be tucked so make sure the IV   remains patent.  
**Antibiotics:** Usually Ancef, unless contraindicated.  
**Emergence:** Avoid coughing, since there is a neck incision. A smooth emergence reduces bleeding. 

**Extubation:** We were taught to perform an awake extubation on these procedures. Many CRNAs will now perform deep extubations if the patient has a good airway. Use good judgment.  
  
**Possible Complications:**  
Neck hemorrhage or hematoma.  
Damage to the carotid or vertebral artery resulting in a stroke or excessive bleeding, even death.  
Damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve resulting in hoarseness.  
Damage to the superior laryngeal nerve resulting in dysphagia.  
Damage to the esophagus or trachea resulting in infection.  
Damage to the dura, resulting in a cerebrospinal fluid leak or pockets of cerebral spinal fluid beneath the incision (pseudomeningocele).  
Neurological Myelopathy.

The C-arm is utilized, so you will need a lead apron.
