### Ruptured Globe Repair

A Ruptured Globe is a tear in the outer surface of the eyeball. It is an ophthalmologic emergency. Aqueous humor can escape from the anterior chamber, which can make the eye look flat.  
**AVOID increasing IOP** (coughing or HTN). It can cause the expelling of intraocular contents! If that happens, the patient will be blind. If the patient is alert and oriented, and needs to be repositioned in the stretcher, DO NOT let them do it themselves. Any degree of straining will increase IOP.  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT, smooth RSI. Avoid Anectine.  
**OGT:** Most likely a full stomach. You may want to pass one when the patient is deep at the end of the case.    
**Antiemetics:** Maximal.  
**Position:** Supine and arms tucked and the patient remains on the stretcher. The stretcher is parked 90-180 degrees away from you after the airway is secured.  
**IV Access**: 22G is acceptable. A 500mL NS bag with micro drip tubing is popular. Don’t over hydrate. Narcotics can cause painful urinary retention in PACU, causing HTN.  
The patient may need to be catheterized.  
**EBL**: Minimal  
**Duration:** 1-3 hours. Depends on the surgeon and injury.  
 

**Pre-OP**  
First, if there is a sight-threatening retrobulbar hemorrhage, a Lateral canthotomy and cantholysis (LCC) should be done.  (LCC) is a simple procedure used to decompress a compartment syndrome of the orbit. This will decrease the pressure build up and avoid any ischemia to the retina and optic nerve. The Eye doc can perform this. Most of these patients will have a CT or MRI to assess other injuries.
