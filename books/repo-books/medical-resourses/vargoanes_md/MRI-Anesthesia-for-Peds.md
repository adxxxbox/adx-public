MRI Anesthesia for Peds   

### MRI Anesthesia for Peds

  
_Edited by Lauren Freedman, CRNA St Petersburg, FL_  

The idea of doing anesthesia for an MRI may be foreign. In contrast to the short duration CT scan, a MRI scan sequences can be quite long with certain kids requiring 45 minutes or more of movement free scan time.

As this is such a foreign environment, be sure you remind yourself of the rules every time you enter the MRI area, and especially check yourself every time you enter the scanner! No metal whatsoever; not a watch strapped to your wrist, a pen with a metal spring inside, not a pin in your hair. Don’t grab an extra chair, or rush in for a code or lost airway without checking with the MRI tech and ensuring everything is metal free. Look for an “MRI safe” sticker on your equipment. Question the IV pole, pump, chair, bed, pen, clipboard, trashcan…question everything. A flying non-MRI projectile could kill your patient, or you.

Also, as this is a foreign environment, ensure all normal/routine/required safety checks are present/performed. Suction may not be readily available, but inquire and locate the safest/quickest route. The same applies with other variables; i.e. Ambu-bag, mask, supplemental O2, etc. Communicate with the staff and maintain constant vigilance in this unfamiliar, non-traditional anesthetic environment.

In some facilities, the child can be induced in a separate induction room, or right on the MRI table, with or without parents present. The IV is placed, airway secured, and the child is then transported to a ready and waiting MRI scanner. Similarly, emergence usually takes place either in the induction room, PACU or the scanner itself.

**Room set-up**Find out ahead of time how many kids you are doing and their ages.  
If you have 6 kids, you will need 6 warm IV bags and tubing primed ahead of time (assuming they are all inhalation induction). Ensure that the anesthesia monitors are available and on (including gas analyzer) and airway tubing extension is either with you in induction area or already waiting in the MRI scanner.

**Airway Equipment  
**MRI compatible laryngoscope handle and blades  
LMAs  
Oral and nasal airways  
Baby safe mask device or Ambu bag  
Suction equipment with long enough tubing  
  
**Drugs:** The standard anesthesia drugs and pediatric emergency drugs.  
Anectine and atropine  
**Narcotics:** Not needed. MRI is painless.**IV Equipment:** A container of 22g IV catheters and essentials (ETOH swabs, tegaderm, tape, 4x4 gauze and a roll of elastic coband to wrap the IV to make it more secure. Have it available for the IV starter while you are mask inducing. Find out if contrast is needed and if a certain extremity is preferred.  
Primed IV tubing (usually 500cc bag with micro tubing) for each case.  
**Hydration: 4:2:1** **(below is just a common reference)**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

  
**A-Line:** Not MRI compatible, the transducers have metal  
**Cover the patient:** Yes, after the airway is secured, it is common to cover the patient with a blanket or two. However it is important to have some sort of temp monitoring because the scans themselves can warm the patient and they may easily become over heated.  
**Ventilator circuit:** Stretch out your ventilator circuit as you may need the extra length. Especially if it is an MRI of the abdomen. You could even request the MRI tech to demonstrate how far the child will be advanced in the MRI away from the ventilator to make sure you have enough tubing and IV slack.**Lead apron:** Not needed, but you need one for CT scans.  
**Narcotics:** Not needed. MRI is painless.

**Monitoring:** MRI uses its own EKG stickers that need to be placed in a certain pattern and pulse ox probes**.** From my experience, many of the MRI monitors are not the most reliable and may need adjusting periodically. Many are wireless and therefore battery dependent, if it goes dead all the sudden, be aware and ready with a new battery pack. After induction and prior to the start of the MRI scan, it may be helpful to gently secure the pulse oximetry monitor around the child’s finger with tape. This will help to prevent the monitor from falling off and/or if/when the patient moves their fingers.

**MRI Tech:** The MRI tech is your best resource. They help you a lot with these procedures and can make your job so much easier.  
Ask the MRI Tech the following:  
**  
What are they scanning?**  
For abdominal scans, you will need to stretch out your ventilator tubing or get an extension. Some abdominal scans may also require breath holding and paralysis may be required.  
**Duration:** 30 to 180 minutes. Depends on what they are scanning and the type of MRI scanner.  
  
Today, most MRI magnets operate at 1.5T and many at 3T. The 3T magnets are much faster and stronger.  
  
**Siemens 3T Magnetom Trio MRI scanner (3T MRI)  
**Many hospitals are now using the 3T MRI scanner that generates a magnetic field twice the strength of 1.5 Tesla machines and 10 to 15 times the strength of low field or open MRI scanners. This basically means faster results with less anesthesia time.

With the 3T machine having a magnetic field much stronger than other MRIs, you need to be extra careful. I have seen CRNAs actually feel light headed being too close to the machine while leaning into or getting closer while injecting meds etc. Most CRNAs do not sit against the machine while paper charting like with the older MRI machines.

**Personal items you should not bring in the MRI room  
**Cell phones  
Beepers  
Non plastic watches  
Keys  
Banking/credit cards  
Some Pens are MRI safe  
Be aware that some “costume” type jewelry may be magnetic and fitbits can be ruined

**Transporting the patient into the MRI room  
**Normally you have to carry the child from a stretcher just outside the MRI room from the parents to inside the MRI room where you place him/her on the MRI table. Some locations have MRI safe stretchers that the child is induced on then taken into the scanner and transferred onto the MRI scanner table

Depending on the patient, you may be able to position the patient on the MRI table outside the MRI room and wheel the MRI table back in the MRI room for convenience.  
  
**Placing on the monitors  
**The pulse oximetry, EKG and BP cable usually run off specifically MRI compatible monitor that is separate from your anesthesia ventilator. The MRI tech will assist you and your anesthesia partner on properly placing the monitors on while you are inducing your patient via inhalation induction. There is even a special pattern the EKG leads need to be placed on. Make sure all the monitors are working prior to situating yourself for charting and the starting of the scanner.  
  
**Anesthesia:** General/LMA and sometimes ETT. LMA is more popular.  
Why take the chance of a Wiggle Mac?  
We rarely do a MAC on these patients. If the child moves, time is lost due to the need to rescan. Our job is to keep the motionless to expedite the procedure.  
But be aware of the possibility of your tube moving as the scanner bed moves in and out of the scanner. Be prepared to Guard your airway as the MRI tech adds or removes coils on the patient (like scanner pads).  
**  
Propofol infusion with an ETCO2 NC**  
If we use a continuous infusion, we try to keep it simple, we run our propofol at 1cc/kg/hour which translates to166mcg/kg/min (no narcotics).

**Induction:** Depends on the facility and anesthesia provider in charge. We do our inductions in a closely located induction room in a chair on mom’s lap or right on the MRI scanner bed.Inhalation induction followed by an IV insertion is the most common. Sometimes you will get lucky if your patient already has an IV.  
**Remember:** When inducing on the MRI table, you will have to lean sideways to insert the LMA or ETT, as opposed to the head of the bed we are accustomed to. You could request the table to be moved away from the scanner so you could be positioned at the head of the patient.

  
**Nitrous:** Yes for induction, but sometimes nitrous is not available in the scanner room.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Not usually unless breath holding is required. Sometimes paralysis is also needed for patients that won’t remain still despite being deep.**Narcotics:** Usually none. This is a painless procedure and narcotics are rarely administered.  
  
**Hydration:** 4:2:1  
Make sure you do not over hydrate. You may be sitting outside the MRI room and the IV bag can empty if the IV clamp is left wide open.

After you secure your airway (ETT or LMA), the MRI tech will secure the patients arms etc and place a 1-2 blankets over the patient. Make sure all your monitors are working before you leave the scanner.  
  
**Age Range:** any age, premature to adult.

**Foley Catheter:** Not usually necessary unless a very long scan is expected.  
  
**Ventilator circuit:** Stretch out your ventilator circuit because you may need the extra length. Especially if it is an MRI of the abdomen. You could even request the MRI tech to demonstrate how far the child will be advanced in the MRI away from the ventilator to make sure you have tubing and IV slack. Some CRNAs utilize ventilator extension tubing when needed.

**Anesthesia location:** Some CRNAs prefer to sit in the room near the anesthesia machine. Ear plugs are available due to the loud noise.  
Some MRI facilities are arranged so the anesthesia provider may sit just outside a large window with a close view of the monitoring. The MRI tech can usually stop the scan incase you need to go back into the MRI room.  
If you position yourself right outside the room, never place back any of your personal belongings that initially removed until you are transporting the patient back after the scanning is complete. If your child loses their airway or codes, you will need the scanner turned off and immediately attend to the patient. No time to remove personal items.  
  
**Spontaneous Respirations  
**Most of us lets the child breath back soon after induction.  
**  
For Abdominal MRI  
**For an abdominal MRI, the patient will be inserted more into the MRI requiring more a greater length needed for your ventilator and IC tubing. You will need to make sure you offer enough slack. You can ask the MRI tech to advance the patient into the MRI to show you how much slack you will need before the scanning starts.

**EBL:** None  
**  
For electronic charting  
**Computerized charting is not MRI compatible, so you will have to sit just outside the MRI window to do your charting. Despite the vitals continuously being slaved to your monitor, you still need to be able to visualize the monitor at all times, So make sure the monitor is close to the window so you can easily view it. Many are slaved to a monitor outside the winder where you are sitting observing the patient.  
  
**Gadolinium** **contrast:** Gadolinium based contrast medium (MRI contrast) makes certain tissues, and abnormalities more clearly visible with an MRI. The MRI tech may hand you a syringe for you to administer it IV. Make sure you flush it.

**Injection:** Sometimes the MRI Tech will ask you to inject a contrast IV. We usually do.If the tech does inject, always confirm what he/she is injecting and the amount. It is your patient that is receiving an injection.**  
  
Siemens 3T Magnetom Trio MRI scanner (3T MRI)  
**Many hospitals are now using the 3T MRI scanner that generates a magnetic field twice the strength of 1.5 Tesla machines and 10 to 15 times the strength of low field or open MRI scanners. This basically means faster results with less anesthesia time.

With the 3T machine having a magnetic field much stronger than other MRIs, you need to be extra careful. I have seen CRNAs actually feel light headed being too close to the machine while leaning into or getting closer while injecting meds etc. Most CRNAs do not sit against the machine while paper charting like with the older MRI machines.

**Emergence: standard**

**Transporting the patient to PACU  
**Many of the MRIs are located on a floor or two below the operating room and PACU. So transport the patient with a portable pulse ox. I have noticed that anesthesia providers also bring along an intubation kit and emergency meds. Some institutions have their own PACU for radiology
