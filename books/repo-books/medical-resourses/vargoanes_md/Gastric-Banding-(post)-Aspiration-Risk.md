### Gastric Banding (post) Aspiration Risks

It is well documented that post gastric banding patients with weight losses of 40-50kg become high aspiration risks in subsequent surgeries. Studies suggest that esophagogastric peristalsis is altered after gastric banding. Lower esophageal sphincter (LES) malfunction and lower esophageal dilatation are also reported. These changes obviously make the patient prone for aspiration.

So these patients are considered a full stomach. It is suggested that patients undergo a minimum fast of 24 hours for solid food and 12 hours for liquids prior to surgery.  
These patients may have to be admitted preoperatively to give IV fluids. Prokinetic agents should be given as premedication 12 hour and 1 hour before surgery.  
  
Any airway manipulation should be under direct visualization, and RSI with endotracheal intubation should be considered mandatory for general anesthesia.
