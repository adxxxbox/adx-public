### Platelet Function Assays

Currently, most anti-platelet therapies are not routinely monitored with platelet function testing. This can also be dangerous with patients on antiplatelets with stents. Stent thrombosis can be the result of an impaired or inadequate responsiveness to aspirin and/or clopidogrel therapy. Platelet Function Assays are becoming more popular to evaluate platelet function in patients on antiplatelet medications perioperatively.  
  
_As many as 40% of patients on antiplatelet medications may not receive the expected platelet inhibiting effect!_  
  
Various platelet function tests are used to evaluate the ability of platelets to form a clot. They may be used for a variety of reasons.  
**  
Reasons for platelet function testing:  
**Preoperative evaluation of platelet function  
Evaluation of women with menorrhagia  
Determining the presence of drug-induced platelet dysfunction  
Determining patient compliance with aspirin and other antiplatelet drugs  
Determining platelet functionality in high-risk pregnancy  
Evaluation of patients with suspected inherited or acquired platelet disorders, such as von Willebrand disease (vWD)  
Evaluation of the bleeding patient  
Monitoring DDAVP treatment in patients with Type I vWD  
  
**How platelet function devices work**  
When a blood sample is received, the platelets are activated using a variety of receptor agonists.  
Receptor agonists may be ADP, epinephrine, collagen, thrombin, PGE1 and others.  
The presence of an antiplatelet drug will reduce platelet activation by that specific agonist it is being expose to, but the platelets may still be activated by the other agonist.  
**Example:** If the agonist ADP does not activate the platelets while the other agonist do, you can safely assume your patient is on clopidogrel. Remember that clopidogrel is an “ADP antagonists.”  
  
**Another Example:** Inhibitors (Eptifibatide and Abciximab) will NOT interfere with platelet activation, but **they** will alter the GP IIb/IIIa receptors on the surface of platelets and prevent fibrinogen from attaching to form a platelet plug.  
  
This will inhibit platelet-fibrinogen reaction and reduce aggregometry measurements regardless of the activators used.

**Global platelet dysfunction not related to antiplatelets  
**All the platelet agonists will fail (not activate the platelets).  
  
**Platelets Function Analyzers  
**The standard (baseline) values are specific for each analyzer and cannot be universally used like PT/PTT and INR.  
**The** **Platelet Function analyzers discussed are:

_If you already know the antiplatelet drug your patient is taking, you can order the specific tests for the classification of that drug._  
  
**VerifyNow IIB/IIIa Test:** For GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor drugs abciximab and eptifibatide  
**VerifyNow Aspirin Test:** Measures platelet response to aspirin.  
Expressed in aspirin reaction units (ARU).  
**Verify Now PRU Test:** Measures platelet response to P2Y12 inhibitor drugs clopidogrel,  
prasugrel, ticlopidine and Ticagrelor.  
Expressed in P2Y12 units (PRU)  
  
**The PFA test results are DEPENDENT on:**  
Platelet function  
Plasma von Willebrand Factor level  
Platelet count  
Hematocrit (to some extent)
