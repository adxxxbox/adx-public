### Burns and Anesthesia Plan

_Providing safe and effective anesthesia for burn surgery requires an understanding of the pathophysiological consequences of a severe burn trauma._

Major burns cause massive tissue destruction and activation of an inflammatory response that leads to dramatic physiologic derangements. Burn injury pathophysiology evolves in 2 distinct phases, a burn shock phase followed by a hypermetabolic phase (pending magnitude of burn). Both phases have an impact on anesthetic management by altering patient hemodynamics.

The most common burn procedures are repeated debridement and grafting of the full-thickness burns.

You must remember that burns are a form of trauma, so a thorough pre-op assessment is needed because of all the body systems the burns affected.

Airway edema is common, and these patients are aggressively hydrated in the first 48 hours according many fluid resuscitation protocols.

Airway injury and / or inflammation may not present initially depending on the etiology; chemical toxicity (smoke, products of combustion) or thermal.

**Pre-op**  

Ask yourself, “Is the patient in an Acute or Chronic Burn Phase?”

**Pay particular attention to**  

-   Airway status
-   Pulmonary status (work of breathing, blood gases, CXR)
-   Volume/hemodynamic status

**Acute Phase Considerations**  
Many of these patients are brought to the operating room in the acute phase of the burn. They are in shock, volume depleted, and may be unstable. You will most likely need pressors with anesthesia.  
Acute onset of airway edema can result in acute obstruction and death  
Fluid resuscitation is needed in the shock phase related to increased vascular permeability; pending magnitude of burn  
Acid-Base imbalance  
Electrolyte imbalance may vary due to capillary leak, third spacing, and resuscitation efforts.  
Depending on resuscitation volumes and fluid type(s) used, coagulation and/or electrolytes may be altered or dilutional

**Chronic Phase Considerations (mostly reconstructive procedures)**  
Drug tolerance; especially narcotics  
Difficult airway remains; residual or continued inflammation/injury  
Altered pharmacokinetics; plasma protein imbalance, altered intravascular volume  
Psychiatric concerns; sensitivity to scars, possibly taking antidepressant or similar medications

**Previous Anesthesia Records**  
Many of these burn procedures are repeats. It could save you time by accessing previous anesthesia records.

**Preoperative Assessment**  
**Pulmonary:** Is there airway edema? Remember that airway edema _may or may not_ appear suddenly with new burn patients. The patient may already be intubated when the airway is in question. Extubation may not be a good option until much later in the burn unit (Also review “Burn Patient –Airway.” For details).  
Careful assessment of neck and oral cavity is necessary to avoid overlooking potential difficulties intra and post-operatively.

**Cardiac**: Cardiac status varies with how recent the burn trauma is.  
Cardiac output may be decreased during shock phase  
Hypovolemia may be present related to loss of intravascular proteins and fluids.  
SVR may be increased but will reverse depending on size of burn.  
Tachycardia is usually present reflecting increased oxygen consumption.  
Blood pressure may vary; endogenous catecholamines can remain elevated post shock phase.  
(Also review “Burn and Cardiac Effects” for details)

**Neuro:** Always document and get recent assessments when possible. These patients may be heavily sedated.

**Renal:**  
Assess for acute renal failure from the combined effects of  

-   Hypovolemia
-   Increased catecholamines
-   Increased angiotensin
-   Increased vasopressin
-   Increased aldosterone

  
(Also review “ Burns-Renal and Hepatic” for details)

Is hyperglycemia present?  
The increased levels of stress hormones above may lead to hyperglycemia and insulin resistance.

**GI:**  
All emergency burns are “Full Stomach,” as with any trauma.  

-   Keep an eye for a paralytic ileus or an eventual stress ulcer.
-   Liver damage may result from hypovolemia.
-   NPO times for repeat burn excision or graft patients should be kept at a safe minimum to avoid catabolic conditions; TPN and intralipid nutrition should remain when possible.

**Hematology:**  
Assess for coagulopathies  

-   Dilutional from aggressive fluid resuscitation
-   Thrombocytopenia or DIC with shock and / or sepsis

  
Is the albumin and other plasma proteins diluted? If so, remember that versed is a plasma protein bound drug.

**Possible EBL and blood transfusion**  
What is the starting Hb/Hct? Is there blood available?  
Debridement procedures usually have large blood losses. Ask the surgeon how extensive the debridement will be?  
What is the transfusion history; volumes, reactions (repeat debridement and grafts)?  
EBL for debridement procedures are around 4cc/cm2 .  
Many anesthesia providers start infusing blood in the beginning of the case.  

-   Preoperative anemia is common due to inflammatory mediated RBC destruction and bone marrow suppression especially in full thickness burns > 15%
-   Blood is a transplant and carries risk factors that must be considered

**Room Temperature**  
Warm the room, use a fluid warmer(s) and warming blanket.  
These patients are very prone to hypothermia.  
Normothermia to these patients may be 38 to 39c rather than 37c.

**Patient Preparation**  

-   **Labs** (extensive)

-   CBC
-   Electrolytes
-   BUN
-   Cr
-   Glucose
-   Urinalysis
-   Type and cross for blood products
-   Dimer or fibrin split products –if DIC is suspected
-   Coagulation studies
-   LFTs
-   CXR
-   ABGs

-   **Start Hydrating Preoperatively**

-   If your patient is hypovolemic, consider early volume replacement. For debridement procedures, many anesthesia providers start transfusing PRBCs preoperatively.
-   Blood products should be available

Consider versed and narcotics pre-operatively for these patients if their BP permits.  
  
Consider patient tolerance to opioid and anxiolysis medications due to possible increasing needs during prolonged hospitalization.  
  
When receiving patients, document skin breakdown noticed especially related to medical devices; BP cuffs, SaO2 probes, temperature probes, ETT, tape, cables, lines, or debris under patient, etc.

**Room Set up**  
Warm the room, fluid warmer and warming blanket.  
Standard monitors  
Needle electrodes may be needed.Regular ECG electrodes may be difficult to place secondary to a lack of intact skin. It may be necessary to staple the leads or use needle electrodes on the patient to obtain an acceptable ECG tracing.  
BP cuff can be on a lower extremity.  
Arterial line or BP cuff can be placed over the burned area with a sterile lubricating dressing. Always check with the surgeon first; rotation of BP cuff and SaO2 probe sites may be necessary due to skin breakdown.

**Anesthesia:** General/ETT or LMA  
Airway selection depends on patient status and progress made form the initial burn trauma; i.e., if the patient arrives intubated with a continuous propofol infusion, then you obviously know you will be sending the patient backthat way.

**Induction:**  
RSI with Glide Scope(if not already intubated)  
Airway edema is common for making a difficult intubation  
Consider awake fiberoptic in the presence of neck/facial contractures, reactive airway concerns

Propofol is common. Ketamine is common if they hemodynamically compromised. Ketamine is usually given before etomidate.

Intravascular volume shifts and challenging hemodynamics warrant careful titration of anesthetic agents.

Induction may be necessary on the hospital bed or gurney to ease movement onto the OR table.

**Muscle Relaxants**  
Avoid Succinylcholine the first 70 days after a major burn. Literature varies on avoiding succinylcholine from 24 hours to 2 years.  
Most of the Anesthesia providers usually avoid succinylcholine completely just to be safe.  
Succinylcholine may cause a life threatening increase in potassium due to upregulation of receptors.

**Nondepolarizing Muscle Relaxants (NDMR)**  
Anticipate resistance to NDMRs.  
Muscle relaxation is usually not required for most burn procedures.  
Burn patients have a resistance to NDMRs due to an upregulation of ACH receptors.  
Higher doses of NDMRs may be required. In some cases, 3-5 times the required dose of NDMRs is needed as compared to a non-burn patient.

**Narcotic Demand**  
More narcotics are usually needed due to a build up in tolerance and changes in volume of distribution related to fluid resuscitation.

**IV Access**  
Large bore in the early fluid resuscitation period.  
An arterial line, central line, and in some instances, pulmonary artery catheters are inserted in patients with 40-50% burns if they are hemodynamically unstable.

**Hydration**  
Usually aggressive in the early recovery stages  
(Please review “Burns Fluid Management” for more details)

**The Parkland Formula**  
The Parkland Formula is the most widely used fluid resuscitation formula in the world, though only the initial 24-hour crystalloid portion tends to be followed closely.

**4 x (% of burn) x Kg = fluid resuscitation to be given over 24h**  
The first 50% of crystalloid should be given the first 8 hours  
4 ml / % Burn / kg within the first 24 hours after burn injury, with half of that volume administered within the first 8 hours (from the time of the burn) and the last half given over the remaining 16 hours.

**Actual fluid rates should be continuously adjusted to maintain urine output of:**  
Adults: 0.5 to 1.0 mL/kg/h  
Children: 1.0 to 1.5 mL/kg/h

Patients who tend to require more fluid than predicted by formulas include children and patients with inhalation injuries or additional traumas.

Overshooting fluid requirements is common and thus necessitating careful reassessment of I &O during resuscitation.

**Isotonic crystalloids**  
The fluid loss from burns is predominantly from the extracellular compartment. Therefore, isotonic crystalloids have traditionally been the fluid of choice, especially during the initial 24-hour post-burn period when capillary permeability is maximal.

**Colloids are Controversial**  
The use of colloids (albumin), for volume replacement remains controversial. Many institutions freely administer it when warranted.

**Always follow the Burn Unit Protocols. The above is just a guide**

**EBL:** Anticipate large EBL, especially for debridement procedures.  

-   **Type and Cross:** Yes
-   **Blood available and checked prior to procedures when possible**

**Emergence:** Depends on airway edema and if they are already intubated. As stated above, if the patient is already intubated, they are to remain intubated.

**Post-op top 4 priorities:**  
Pain management  
Prevention of respiratory complications  
Fluid management  
Prevention of infection
