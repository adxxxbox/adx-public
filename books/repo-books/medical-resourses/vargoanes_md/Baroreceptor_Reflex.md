### Baroreceptor Reflex

Baroreceptors are stretch receptors that respond to an increase and decrease in blood pressure.It is the most important role in responding to sudden increases or reductions in arterial pressure.  
It is responsible for making short-term changes in blood pressure and adapts to a new blood pressure level within a few days.  
Commonly utilized when going from sitting to suddenly standing.  
**  
Carotid sinus baroreceptors**  
The most important for regulating arterial pressure.  
Located in adventitial layer of the carotid sinus.  
Responds to pressures ranging from 60-180 mmHg.  
More sensitive than aortic baroreceptors.  
Small changes in arterial pressure dramatically alters receptor firing so that autonomic control can be altered in such a way that the arterial pressure remains very near to the set point.  
The set point changes during exercise, hypertension, and heart failure.  
  
**Aortic arch baroreceptors  
**The receptors have a higher threshold pressure and are less sensitive than the carotid sinus receptors.  
  
Inhalation agents inhibit the baroreceptor reflex in a dose dependent manner.  
This inhibition limits the patient’s response to alterations in BP.  
  
**Sudden increase in BP**

| --- | --- |
| **Stimuli** | Increased BP, stretching of the arterial wall at receptor sites. |
| **Receptor** | Carotid sinus (at the bifurcation of external and internal carotids)  
Aortic arch  
Wall of all large arteries within the neck and thorax |
| **Afferent nerves** | Glossopharyngeal and Vagus nerve  
Carotid baroreceptors: Sinus nerve of Hering, which is a branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX cranial nerve).  
Aortic arch baroreceptors: Innervated by the aortic nerve, which then combines with the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) traveling to the NTS. |
| **Cardiovascular Center**  
(in medulla) oblongata | Nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) located in the medulla of the brainstem.  
Laterally & Rostrally: The area responsible for increasing BP.  
Centrally & Caudally: The area responsible for decreasing BP. |
| **Efferent nerves** | Intermediolateral nucleus (IML) tract  
↑ Parasympathetic-vagus → ↑ Ach release → Heart SA node → ↓ HR  
↓ Sympathetic → Heart → ↓ HR and ↓ Stroke volume  
↓ Sympathetic → ↓ NE to blood vessels → ↑ Vasodilation |
| **Response** | ↓ HR, ↓ SV and ↑ Vasodilation → ↓ BP |
| **Notes** | Typically stretch receptors respond to systemic BP > 170 mmHg.  
Takes seconds to respond. |

  
  
**Sudden decrease in BP**
