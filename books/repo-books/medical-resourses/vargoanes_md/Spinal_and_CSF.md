### Spinal and CSF

The volume and density of CSF influences subarachnoid block height.   
  
CSF volume - is inversely related to block height. This is the most significant physiologic factor. Obese patients have a smaller volume of CSF when compared to the non-obese patient.  
  
Decreased volumes of CSF result in a higher block, whereas increased volumes of CSF decrease the level of blockade. CSF volume is influenced by patient characteristics (i.e. abnormal spinal anatomy).   
  
CSF density - has an impact on the spread of the local anesthetic. For example, if CSF is concentrated with a higher specific gravity, the local anesthetic may not spread as far as it normally would. Alternatively, dilute CSF, with a lower specific gravity, will result in a greater spread of the local anesthetic solution.
