## Bradycardia

_The most common cardiac dysrhythmia during general and neuraxial anesthesia is bradycardia followed by asystole (45%)._

**  
Sinus Bradycardia**  
Heart rate (HR) less than 60 beats per minute (BPM)  
Excessive vagal stimulation during surgery may cause severe bradycardia and hypotension.  
  
**EKG:**  
**Rate**: <60BPM  
**Rhythm:** Regular  
**P waves:** Upright and normal  
**P-R Interval:** Between 0.12-0.2 seconds in duration  
**QRS Complex:** <0.12 seconds in width  
  
ACLS protocol tells us not to treat bradycardia unless it is symptomatic.  
In anesthesia, most of our patients are either sedated (decreased LOC) or asleep.  
Symptomatic bradycardia in anesthesia is usually HYPOTENSION.  
  

**Sometimes we treat Asymptomatic Bradycardia**  
There are occasions we have athletic conditioned patients with a HR < 40 BPM and asymptomatic. Despite being asymptomatic, most anesthesia providers are uncomfortable with a HR in the 30s and will administer 0.1-0.2mg of robinul just to bump the HR up to 40s or 50s.

**Transient Asystole  
**_Transient asystole followed by a surgeon inducing vagal response is not that uncomomon_

_Always alert the surgeon ASAP with the onset of severe bradycardia or asystole._

During surgery, the surgeon may inadvertently induce a transient asystole. The asystole almost always immediately returns to the previous heart rhythm when the surgeon ceases the stimulation that is inducing the transient asystole.

**Below are several possible causes of severe bradycardia and transient asystole**

**  
Laparoscopy procedures:** During CO2 insufflation and pneumoperitoneum

**Lumbosacral spinal surgery:** From traction on the dura.

**Carotid artery or neck surgery:** Carotid sinus hypersensitivity (CSH)  
**Transphenoidal and oral surgery**: Trigeminocardiac reflex (TCR)  
**Craniofacial Surgery:** also Trigeminocardiac Reflex (TCR)  
**Simple Extraction of upper molars:** Trigeminocardiac reflex (TCR)

**Eye Surgery:** Oculocardiac Reflex (OCR)  
**After mandibular nerve block:** Maxillomandibulocardiac Reflex (MCR)**Scrotal Procedures:** Pulling on the spermatic cord

**Vasovagal syncope:** Pre-op psychological stress with IV starts.

**Treatment for Symptomatic Bradycardia  
**In ACLS we are taught the 3 drugs to treat symptomatic bradycardia are:  
Atropine  
Epinephrine  
Dopamine

**In Anesthesia, we usually administer one or more of the following:  
**(Always search for cause)  
Robinul: 0.1 – 0.2 mg for mild bradycardia  
Atropine: 0.5-1mg if it is severe  
Epinephrine: when atropine does not work

**Treatment for mild bradycardia (HR 40-60 BPM)  
**(Always search for cause)Many anesthesia providers administer 0.1-0.2 mg Robinul.  
For a beta-blocked patient, anticholinergics are preferred over a sympathomimetic drug like Ephedrine.

10mg Ephedrine is also acceptable, especially when hypotension is present.  
  
**HR 30-40 BPM with an athletic healthy patient**  
0.1-0.2mg of Robinul is commonly given

**Severe Bradycardia (HR < 30)  
**(Always search for cause)For transient severe bradycardia, many times the HR has already returned to the patient’s baseline by the time you draw up the atropine.0.5mg Atropine is commonly administered**  
  
Severe Bradycardia with critical unstable patient  
**Epinephrine or Atropine is commonly administered

Atropine 0.5 mg is commonly given and can be repeated up to 3mg.

**Transcutaneous pacing perioperatively (rarely used in the operating field)  
**When refractory to meds  
Pacemaker failure

**External Pacer  
**Post cardiac surgery when pacer wires are still intact
