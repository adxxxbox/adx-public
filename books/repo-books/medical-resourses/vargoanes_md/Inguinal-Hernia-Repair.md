### Inguinal Hernia Repair with or w/o Mesh

The inguinal hernia accounts for 75% of all abdominal wall hernias. Inguinal hernias occur 10x more in men versus women. The inguinal region is part of the anterolateral abdominal wall. The surgery looks very simple but the surgeon has to avoid damaging local nerves, ligaments and vessels.

**Types of Inguinal Hernia**  
**Direct:** This hernia arises through a weak point of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal. This type of hernia mostly afflicts adults, especially middle-aged and elderly men.

**Indirect**: This type of hernia arises with the protrusion through the inguinal ring.

It is more common in children. The hernia may already be present at birth. These are mostly seen in males but can also occur in females.

Bilateral and pediatric hernias are most commonly indirect hernias.

  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT for laparoscopic.  
LMA or MAC for non-laparoscopic.  
**MAC:** Some surgeons request a MAC and these patients can do well with an effective local injection. Administer Propofol just prior to the local injection is standard.  
Spinal: Rare (level T6).

**Laparoscopic:** Similar to other laparoscopic procedures.  

**Positioning:** Supine with both arms out. For the Laparoscopic style of case, one arm might need to be tucked. Sometimes Trendelenburg position with laparoscopic.

**Duration:** 45-90 minutes.  
**Blood Loss:** Minimal

**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable

**Anti-emetics:** Yes, to avoid PONV.

**Emergence:** Smooth and avoid coughing.

**Concerns:** Traction on the viscera can cause a vagal stimulation/bradycardia.  
  
**Possible Complications**  
Infection involving the prosthetic biomaterial (mesh).  
Postoperative ileus seromas.  
DVT  
Dehiscence with profound bucking during emergence.

**More Notes**  
**A sliding inguinal hernia:** is an Indirect hernia. A sliding inguinal hernia is a variant that is seen in 3% of hernia cases. Sliding hernias are those in which part of the wall of the sac is formed by a viscus, which is an organ found inside the wall of the sac. Found almost exclusively in males and usually on the left side.
