### Warfarin (Coumadin) – Basic History

Coumadin is the brand name for the drug “warfarin.”  
  
**Sweet Clover**  
Sweet clover (a type of hay) produces small yellow flowers emitting a fragrance resembling that of hay or vanilla. In the 1900’s, it was grown for forage and to build up the soil, since its roots help to keep nitrogen in the soil. Sweet clover is a very nutritious forage. Today it is considered a nuisance because it spreads rapidly and can take over open fields or prairies.  
  
**Sweet Clover Poisoning**  
Discovery begins on the prairies of Canada and the northern plains of America in the 1920s. Previously healthy cattle in these areas began dying of internal bleeding with no obvious precipitating cause.  
Farmers started questioning the diet of their livestock.  
The cattle and sheep had grazed on sweet clover hay (Melilotus alba and Melilotus officinalis) and the incidence of bleeding occurred most frequently when the climate was damp and moldy.  
  
Spoiled damp hay was usually discarded by farmers. But in the 1920’s, many farmers could not afford to buy supplementary fodder for their cattle and thus the moldy hay was used to feed them. It was noticed that this hemorrhagic disease (sweet clover disease) would manifest within 15 days of ingestion and killed the animals within 30-50 days. Veterinarians with limited resources discovered they could reverse sweet clover disease by removing the spoiled hay and by blood transfusion.Ten years after the original outbreak of sweet clover disease, a young Wisconsin farmer, Ed Carlson, noticed his cattle were also experiencing sweet clover poisoning. Ed Carlson doubted sweet clover poisoning because he had fed his cattle with sweet clover for years without any incidences. He then drove 200 miles through a blizzard, with a dead cow in the back of his truck and a milk jug of the dead cow’s anticoagulated blood, to the local agricultural experimental station where investigators Karl Link and his senior student Wilhelm Schoeffel were working.  
  
After years of hard work, Link’s laboratory found that sweet clover contains a substance called coumarin, which is converted (oxidized) to dicoumarol by fungus in moldy hay. Eventually large-scale isolation of dicoumarol was discovered. The work was funded by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF), and patent rights for dicoumarol were given to WARF in 1941. Dicoumarol was named warfarin and was first produced as a rat poison and became very popular. Human trials followed and with many production and dosing adjustments is now safely synthesized and administered daily to millions as a blood thinner.  
  
Warfarin is now being replaced with the newer more target specific anticoagulants that are considered more reliable and do not need routine monitoring.
