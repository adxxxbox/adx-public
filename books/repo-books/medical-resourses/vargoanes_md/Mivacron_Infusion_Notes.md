### Mivacron Infusion Notes

**Doses  
****Initial IV bolus:** 0.05-0.1 mg/kg administered over 5-15 seconds.  
  
**General anesthesia with inhalation agent:** Continuous infusion of 4-5 mcg/kg/min or (0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg/hr).  
  
**TIVA and nitrous oxide:** On average, 5 - 7 mcg/kg/minute (range: 1 - 15 mcg/kg/minute) may be expected to maintain 89% to 99% neuromuscular block.  
  
**Infusion adjustments** should be made in increments of 1 mcg/kg/min (0.06 mg/kg/hr).  
A given rate should be maintained for at least 3 minutes before a rate change is made.  
  
**Critical care setting without an inhalation unit:** 8-10 mcg/kg/min or (0.4-0.6 mg/kg/hr).  
  
**Patients with heterozygous for the atypical plasma cholinesterase gene.**  
The clinically effective duration of block of mivacron 0.15 mg/kg is approximately 10 minutes longer than in control patients.  
  
**Pediatric Dosing:** Require higher infusion rates than adults.  
**TIVA and nitrous oxide:** 14 mcg/kg/min (range: 5 to 31 mcg/kg/min) has shown to maintain an 89% to 99% neuromuscular block.  
  
**Spontaneous recovery:** Is independent of the duration of infusion and comparable to recovery reported for single doses.  
  
**Tachyphylaxis with Mivacron infusion:** None  
  
**Mivacron vial:** 2mg/mL  
  
**Diluting Mivacron  
**2 mg/ml (as is)  
0.5 mg/ml  
  
**Mivacron is compatible with:  
**Lactated Ringer's  
0.9% Saline  
5% Dextrose  
  
**Reversal  
**Not routinely required as it shortens recovery time by only 5-6 minutes.  
Standard doses of neostigmine may be used.  
Evidence of spontaneous recovery should be observed prior to reversal  
The use of a peripheral nerve stimulator to evaluate recovery prior to and following reversal of neuromuscular block is strongly recommended.
