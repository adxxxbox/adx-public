TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate)     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate)

A surgical instrument (resectoscope) is inserted through the urethra to trim away excess prostate tissue that's blocking urine flow. The resectoscope has a stabilized cutting loop that is used to resect tissue and coagulate blood vessels by means of electric current.  
**Indications:** Benign BPH. Always ask the surgeon if he needs muscle relaxation due to the possible stimulation of the obturator nerve (see note below).  
**Anesthetic:** LMA or ETT or spinal. Some surgeons will demand complete relaxation because unexpected movement could cause perforation.  
**If Spinal:** T10 level  
**Position:** Lithotomy   
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes  
**B & O suppository:** Sometimes to prevent bladder spasms. Give at the end of the case.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable. It is nice to know from the urology team if the fluid that went in is close to the fluid out. Use the circulator to calculate your I/Os.  
**Be aware of TUR Syndrome:** see Notes above and below.  

**Obturator Nerve:**  
The obturator nerve passes in close proximity to the inferolateral bladder wall, bladder neck and lateral prostatic urethra. During a transurethral operation, a resection in these areas may result in stimulation of the obturator nerve, causing violent adductor contraction and possible inadvertent bladder perforation. This is NOT because your patient was light! This is why some surgeons demand muscle relaxation or a spinal for many TURPS or simple bladder procedures that otherwise look like they just require an LMA.

**Symptoms and complications of TUR Syndrome:**  
Cyanosis, seizure.  
Bradycardia via a vagal response.  
Prolonged QRS complex.  
HYPO/HYPERtension.  
Hemolysis of RBCs.  
Cerebral edema.  
CHF  
Pulmonary edema.  
Tachycardia and Vfib (when the Na < 120mEq/L).  
  
**_Today, with Bipolar technology and the urology team using isotonic NSS, a TUR Syndrome is very rare._**

**Treatment for TUR Syndrome:**  
Tell the surgeon to stop or quickly finish the procedure.  
Ask the surgeon how much Lasix he/she wants you to administer (he/she will have their own protocol).  
Stop your IV infusion and change it to hypertonic saline.  
Maintain your airway and oxygenation.  
Quickly draw a BMP to verify Na+ levels per the surgeon’s request.  
  
**Other Symptoms if the patient is awake:** Disorientation, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and seizures.  
   
**Bladder Spasms:**  
Many wake up repeating, “I have to Pee,” experiencing cramping and the painful urge to urinate despite the Foley catheter in place. This is from the involuntary contraction of the bladder (detrusor contraction).

**Treatment of Bladder Spasms:**  
B &O Suppository given at the end of the procedure. It does not prevent the spasm; the patient just does not feel it. You may give Robinul 0.2 mg if not contraindicated.  
Low dose Ketamine during the procedure.
