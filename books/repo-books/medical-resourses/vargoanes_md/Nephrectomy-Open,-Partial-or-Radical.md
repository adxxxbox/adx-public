Open Partial or Radical Nephrectomy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Open Partial or Radical Nephrectomy

No different than a laparoscopic except the procedure is usually shorter, may have more blood loss with a slower recovery time.

An open procedure is usually for patients with larger renal tumors that invade deeply into the renal tissue. Advanced cancers can decrease total kidney function.  
A 6-12 inch incision is made.

For a radical, once the surgeon reaches the area of the kidney, he identifies and ligates the renal artery, vein and ureter. The kidney is then separated them from surrounding tissues and removed.  
For a partial, the tumor or lesion is also separated from the surrounding tissues except for the fat directly over the tumor.

The renal artery is temporarily clamped. The kidney can be cooled for 5-10 minutes.

The tumor or diseased area with the surrounding disease –free area is removed through ennucleation or wedge resection using endoscopic scissors, cautery or coagulating shears. Biopsy of the base may be done.

The cut areas of the kidney are then sutured or glued together using tissues glues.

**Pre-Op**: EKG, CBC, PT / PTT, CMP, Urinalysis and Type & Cross.  
We usually have 2 units of blood on stand-by.

**Anesthetic**: General/ETT  
A-line: Depends how sick the patient is. Despite less EBL today, some still prefer to put one in because of the potential large blood loss. I have seen some go without an **A-line**.

**Nitrous Oxide**: No, it can expand the bowel and get in the way.  
IV Access: 2 large bore for potential blood loss.  
If it’s a dialysis patient, avoid an extremity with an A-V Fistula.  
Those who will need future dialysis, forearm veins should be preserved for the creation of future fistulae and therefore not used.  
Neosynephrine Drip: Yes  
IV Fluid: Normal Saline and Potassium containing fluids should be avoided in those with impaired renal function.  
Fluid Balance: Some surgeons still prefer these patients to get a bowel prep. This is not as common anymore.

Any patient with ESRD who has had recent dialysis may likewise be fluid depleted pre-operatively. Appropriate fluid resuscitation must be given to any patient with signs of dehydration pre-operatively to avoid excessive hypotension at induction. of anesthesia. Otherwise, replacement fluids to compensate for pre-operative fasting and bowel preparation must be given early during surgery.

**Position**: Supine for anterior (abdominal) approach or  
Lateral (transperitoneal) approach with axillary roll.  
Kidney Rest: Up (“breaking” the table in the middle) used to raise the loin and improve surgical access.  
Patient’s waist should be over the middle break in the OR table.

**EBL**: Some literature states 200-750mLs. In reality with an experienced surgeon it’s around 200mLs. Remember, they temporarily clamp the blood vessels.

Greater EBL if it’s tumor related, because it could be vascular.  
The kidney is a very vascular organ and hemorrhage is real risk. Bleeding can occur from the renal artery, the inferior vena cava, or from aberrant arteries.

**Duration**: 90 minutes - 3 hours  
  
**Possible Complications**  
Hemorrhage  
Urinary Fistula  
UTI  
DVT  
Wound infection  
Pleural effusion  

**More Notes**:  
A portion of each kidney is protected by the lowest one or two ribs and by the muscles that cover the back and side of the body.  

Remember, renal patients tend to have other comorbidities:

HTN from increased activity of the renin/ angiotensin system.  
Ischemic heart disease PVD.  
Edema may be due to proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia, or as a result of cardiac failure.  
Pericarditis can occur in uremic patients. Peripheral and autonomic neuropathies may be present.
