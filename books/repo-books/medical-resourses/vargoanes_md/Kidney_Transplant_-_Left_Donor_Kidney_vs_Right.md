### Kidney Transplant - Left Donor Kidney vs Rights

The left kidney is almost always preferred over the right.  
The aorta lies on the left side of the abdomen.  
The vena cava lies on the right side of the abdomen.  
The anatomy of these vessels makes the left renal vein longer than the right one.  
A longer vein is usually easier to sew into a kidney transplant recipient than a short vein. For this reason, they typically take the left kidney.  
**  
Other influencing actors:**  
About 1/10 of the people have more than one renal artery going to a kidney.  
So it may be preferable to remove the kidney with one artery rather than a kidney with two.  
This makes it easier to sew the kidney into the recipient.  
  
If one kidney is larger than the other, they will usually remove the smaller kidney for transplantation and leave the larger kidney in the donor.  
  
**Renal Cysts:**  
Occasionally, a kidney may have a cyst.  
It may be best to remove that kidney so the cyst or mass can be removed before it is transplanted.
