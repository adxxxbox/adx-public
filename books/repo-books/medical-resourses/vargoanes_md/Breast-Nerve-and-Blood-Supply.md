3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th intercostal perforating arteries.  
**Venous blood drainage:**  
Superficial vein system under the dermis, and by the deep vein system parallel to the artery system.

The primary lymph drainage system is the retromammary lymph plexus in the pectoral fascia.

**Nerve Sensation**

Thoracic spinal nerve 4 (T4 nerve) innervates and supplies sensation to the nipple-areola complex.
