# Sufenta

**Sufenta (Sufentanil Citrate)**

  
**Class:** Opioid Agonist  
Synthetic opioid  
Sufenta = 50 mcg/mL.  
5 to 10 times more potent than Fentanyl!  
Dose should be calculated based on ideal body weight.  
  
The most potent opioid.  
A derivative of fentanyl.  
The main use of this medication is in operating suites and critical care where pain relief is required for a SHORT period of time. Usually used as a drip.

**Onset:** 1-2 minutes  
**Duration:** 15-30 minutes

4 mLs of Sufenta added to 16 mLs saline syringe yields 10 mcg/mL.  
10 mLs of Sufenta added to 36 mLs saline syringe yields 10 mcg/mL.  
**Common Induction dose:** 0.1-0.3 mcg/kg.  
**Common PRN bolus for pain:** 0.1 mcg/kg or 5-10 mcg bolus.**Common infusion:** 0.2 mcg/kg/hour.  
**Infusion range:** 0.2-0.5 mcg/kg/hour.  
  
Maintenance infusion rates should be adjusted based upon the induction dose of SUFENTA so that the total dose does not exceed 1 µg/kg/hr of expected surgical time.

**How to Mix:**  
**Peds or really short cases**  
Add 1 mL of Sufenta (50mcg) to 9mL of NS in syringe  
(10mL total) = 5 mcg/mL  
**Short Cases**  
Add 2 mL of Sufenta to 18 mL of NS in 20mL syringe = 5 mcg/mL.  
**Cases > 30 minutes**  
Add 5 mL of Sufenta to 45 mL=5 mcg/mL

**Pharmacologic Category**  
Rapid onset with relatively limited accumulation.  
Rapid distribution of 0.72 minutes  
Redistribution of 13.7 minutes.  
Elimination half-life of 148 minutes.  
Rapidly and extensively metabolized into a large number of inactive metabolites.  
Inactive metabolites excreted with the urine and feces.  
The liver and small intestine - major sites of biotransformation.  
80% of a dose is excreted within 24 hours and only 2% of the dose is eliminated as unchanged drug.  
Plasma protein binding - 92.5%.  
Considered safe with Peds as young as 1 day old.  
The clearance healthy neonates is ½ that in adults and children.  
Clearance has high rate but dependent of hepatic blood flow.  
  

**Protein Binding vs Fentanyl**  
Has a higher protein binding than Fentanyl  
Protein binding of Sufenta is 92.5%  
Protein binding of Fentanyl is 79-87%  
A decrease in **alpha1-acid glycoprotein** means less protein for Sufenta to bind with. This increases the free fraction of (unbound) circulating Sufenta. The elevated (unbound) circulating Sufenta could enhance the effects of a patient.
