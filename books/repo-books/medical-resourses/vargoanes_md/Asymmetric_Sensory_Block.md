### Asymmetric Sensory Block

  
_Daniel D. Moos CRNA_

A unilateral block is a common complication of epidural procedures. It is often associated with a catheter being threaded (or migrating) too deep into the epidural space (literature suggests that threading the epidural catheter 3‐5 cm is optimal) or with having the patient lie on one side for too long.  
  
**Troubleshoot  
**Roll the patient onto her side and ensure that the catheter is at the proper depth at the skin.  
If it has migrated inward, pull it back to the site where it was originally taped at the skin.  
After repositioning the patient on the side without the block, either give a manual bolus of a local anesthetic solution or ask that the patient press her PCEA button.  
  
If the catheter is still where it was originally taped, roll the patient onto the side that has diminished analgesia, withdraw the catheter 1‐2 cm and bolus as above.  
  
Remember to aspirate prior to administering any bolus.
