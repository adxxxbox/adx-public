### Epidural Blockade: Mechanism of Action, Spread, Uptake & Elimination

Remember, an epidural may be thought of as a slow spinal!  
Epidurals are volume blocks.  
Epidurals are slow spinals because the local anesthetics administered in the epidural space must diffuse across the dura and into the subarachnoid space to work on the nerve roots in that area.**  
  
Local anesthetic mechanism of action  
**Local anesthetics block the sodium channels of the axons.With epidurals, in contrast to spinals, local anesthetics administered into the epidural space must travel through the dura to reach the targeted nerve roots in the subarachnoid space whereas a spinal anesthetic is achieved by (direct subarachnoid injection).  
  
With epidurals, there are several barriers to the spread of local anesthetic. This necessitates that larger volumes of local anesthetic administered compared to the volume used for spinal anesthesia.  
  
**Barriers include dura mater, systemic absorption, and epidural fatty tissue.**  
**Dura mater:** acts as a modest barrier.  
**Systemic Absorption:** Most local anesthetic solution administered into the epidural space is absorbed systemically through the extensive venous system in the epidural space.  
**Epidural fat:** acts as a reservoir.  
  
The remaining local anesthetic reaches the spinal nerve and nerve roots.  
The degree of horizontal and vertical spread is dependent upon the VOLUME of local anesthetic administered. Since the epidural space is a potential space, higher VOLUMES of local anesthetics must be administered to allow spread of the local anesthetic to nerve roots in the for the proposed surgical procedure.  
  
In addition, a larger volume and dose of local anesthetic is required due to large mixed nerves found in the epidural space, penetration of the arachnoid and dura mater, absorption of local anesthetic into tissue and fat, and absorption of local anesthetic by epidural veins (peak blood concentration occurs in 10-30 minutes after a bolus).  
  
Local anesthetics absorbed in veins are diluted by blood. The pulmonary system acts as a temporary buffer protecting against toxicity. Subsequent distribution occurs to the vessel rich organs, muscle, and fat.  
  
**Amides** will bind to α-1 globulins which have a high affinity, but become saturated rapidly. Amides are metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys.  
  
**Esters** are metabolized by plasma pseudocholinesterase so rapidly that there are rarely significant plasma levels. Unfortunately, the byproduct of ester metabolism is PABA which may cause allergic reactions in a very small percentage of people.
