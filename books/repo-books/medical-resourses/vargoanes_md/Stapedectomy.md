### Stapedectomy

A surgical treatment for otosclerosis, a disease of ear bone degeneration that causes the stapes (a bone in the middle ear) to become fixed and prevents it from vibrating normally. During stapedectomy surgery, the stapes bone is removed (typically with a micro-laser), and a prosthesic of various materials is inserted in the middle ear as a replacement.

**Anesthetic**: General/ETT  
**Positioning:** Supine with the head turned away with ipsilateral arm tucked.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Depends on facial nerve monitoring.  
**Duration:** 1-2.5 hours; depends on the surgeon.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
**Facial Nerve Monitoring:** Check with the surgeon.  
**Emergence:** Smooth  
Consider PONV meds.  
**EBL:** minimal

**Possible Complications**  
Hearing loss of 1%  
Facial palsy  
Vertigo in the immediate post op period.  
Vomiting  
Perilymph gush: rarely; <.03%; but if you see it you won’t forget the profuse flow of CSF when the vestibule is opened. The etiology of this CSF leak is either a widened cochlear aqueduct or a defect in the fundus of the internal auditory canal. Surgeon usually will place a tissue graft over the oval window and then finish the surgery.  
Tympanic membrane tear  
Dead labyrinth  
Perilymph fistula  
Labyrinthitis

Granuloma (Reparative)  
Tinnitus  
Floating foot plate: rarely occurs when using a laser or microdrill.  
Chorda Tympani Nerve Damage  
Taste disturbances
