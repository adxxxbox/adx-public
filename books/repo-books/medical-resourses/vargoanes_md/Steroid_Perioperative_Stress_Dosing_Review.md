Steroid Perioperative Stress Dosing Review    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Steroid Perioperative Stress Dosing Review

\- Patients may present for surgery currently on glucocorticoids for treatment of systemic autoimmune inflammatory disease, asthma, and chronic pulmonary disease, and post organ transplantation.  
\- Recall that adrenal glucocorticoid stimulates phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) to convert norepinephrine to epinephrine in the adrenal medulla.  
\- Naturally, plasma and adrenal corticosterone levels are very high during stress and tends to fall significantly with exogenous glucocorticoid supplementation.  
\- Patients with a recent history or currently taking steroids may have a suppressed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis via negative feedback resulting in a secondary/tertiary adrenal insufficiency (AI).  
\- With AI, the adrenal cortex cannot secrete enough cortisol in times of stress.  
\- The inability of a suppressed HPA axis to secrete enough cortisol during the stress of surgery can result in cardiovascular collapse from an adrenal crisis.  
_\-Therefore, anesthesia providers usually administer a stress dose (supraphysiologic dose) o a glucocorticoid steroid to prevent this dilemma.  
_\- Patients with AI who are fasting before procedures, glucocorticoid therapy must be continued by parenteral routes if necessary.**Avoid Etomidate:  
**\- Suppression of the adrenal synthesis of cortisol by etomidate is a well-documented side effect.  
\- Dose-dependent in nature, it results in the inhibition of adrenal mitochondrial 11-β hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for the final conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol.  
\- Hence, Etomidate should be avoided in patients at risk for adrenal suppression and adrenal crisis.  
  
**Physiology review:  
Adrenocorticosteroids are steroid derivatives produced in the adrenal cortex and include three endogenous hormones.**  
\- **_Glucocorticoids_** such as cortisol affect carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism and have anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, anti-proliferative, and vasoconstrictive effects.  
**_\- Mineralocorticoids_** such as aldosterone are primarily involved in the regulation of electroland water balance by modulating ion transport in the epithelial cells of the renal tubules of the kidney.  
**_\- Androgens_** (not discussed) such as testosterone are a group of sex hormones.  
**Glucocorticoids vs Mineralocorticoids:  
Glucocorticoids:  
**\- Produced in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex.  
\- Controls body homeostasis, stress and immune responses.  
\- Example: Cortisol (hydrocortisone)  
  
**Cortisol mediates the following:**  
\- Carbohydrate and protein metabolism  
\- Fatty acid transfer  
\- Electrolyte and fluid balance  
\- Anti-inflammatory reactions  
\- Enables the synthesis and release of catecholamines  
\- Contributes to normal vascular permeability, vascular tone, and myocardial contraction by regulating β-receptor synthesis and regulation.  
  
**Mineralocorticoids:  
**\- Produced in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex  
\- Regulating the water and electrolyte balance  
\- Example: Aldosterone  
  
**Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis:**  
\- The HPA axis regulates the secretion of adrenal cortical hormones listed above.  
\- The corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) secreted from the hypothalamus stimulates the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the anterior pituitary gland.  
\- ACTH then stimulates the adrenal gland to secrete glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoids.  
\- The cortisol blood concentration regulates the positive and negative feedback mechanisms that controls the secretion of the hormones.

**Cortisol and circadian rhythm**  
\- The secretion of cortisol changes and depends on the pulsatile secretion of CRH and ACTH according to the circadian rhythm.  
\- Serum cortisol concentration reaches the highest concentration around 6–9 am, then drops to the lowest concentration is around 11 pm to 1 am.  
  
**Serum cortisol levels:  
\-** **Adult daily secretion:** 5 to 10 mg/m2/day (body surface area per day), which is equivalent to equivalent to 5 to 7 mg of oral prednisone or 20 to 30 mg of hydrocortisone.  
**\- 6-9 am:** 15/mcg/dL  
**\- 11p-1am:** 2mcg/dL  
**\- Median value over 24-hour period:** 5.2 mcg/dL  
**\- Normal 24-hour basal secretion:** 8 to 10 mg/day  
\- **Minor surgery or illness:** Secretion of cortisol increases to 50 mg/day  
\- **Severe stress, major trauma:** Secretion rate can reach 200 to 500 mg/day  
**\- Serum levels during stress:** ↑ to 18-20 mcg/dL  
**\- Cortisol secretion during moderate stress:** ↑ up to 30-45 mcg/dL  
**\- Cortisol secretion during severe stress:** ↑ up to 260 mcg/dL  
**\- Note:** Therefore, a large dose of Solu-Medrol is administered with CABG procedures.  
\- Increased levels normalize within 24 to 48 hours after the stress is resolved.  
  
**Perioperative serum cortisol level changes:  
**\- Increase at the time of incision and during surgery.  
**  
The greatest ACTH and cortisol secretion occurs during:**  
\- Reversal of anesthesia  
\- Extubation  
\- The immediate postoperative recovery period, primarily in response to pain.  
  
**Levels of ACTH and cortisol secretion can be reduced by:  
**\- Regional block  
\- Local anesthetic injection prior to incision.  
\- Spinal or epidural anesthesia  
\- Opioids**  
  
Sudden stress (including surgical) activates the HPA axis.**  
Sudden stress will activate the HPA axis to increase serum ACTH and cortisol levels.  
**Stressors that activate the HPA axis:  
**\- Major surgery  
\- Trauma  
\- Burns  
\- Hypoglycemia  
\- High fever  
\- Hypotension  
\- Severe exercise  
\- Cold exposure  
\- Mental stress  
  
**Types of adrenal insufficiency (AI):  
Primary AI:** From a damaged adrenal gland by another cause.  
Example: Metastatic cancer, autoimmune diseases, infection, cancer….  
_Addison’s disease is the most common primary AI._  
**Secondary AI:** From a disease impairing the production of ACTH or CRH of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus.  
  
**Tertiary AI:** The most common form.  
\- Some literature refers to this type as secondary.  
\- It is widely included in secondary AI.  
\- Caused by the negative feedback effect due to iatrogenic corticosteroid therapy.  
\- The degree of adrenal dysfunction is variable and sometimes reversible.  
  
**Perioperative adrenal crises could be disastrous.  
Possible intraoperative symptoms and manifestations:  
  
**\- Severe hypotension refractory to vasopressors, studies have shown that the administration of low doses of vasopressin can be helpful.  
\- Poor response to decreasing depth of anesthesia.  
\- Poor response to fluid resuscitation.  
\- Require the management of metabolic abnormalities.  
\- Shock  
\- Tachycardia  
\- Hypoglycemia  
\- Hyponatremia  
\- Hyperkalemia  
\- Metabolic acidosis  
**  
Possible symptoms and manifestations of a postoperative adrenal crisis:  
**\- Unexplained PONV  
\- Unexplained hypotension  
\- Unexplained orthostasis  
\- Unexplained change in mental status  
\- Hyponatremia or hyperkalemia\- Hypoxia  
\- Fever  
\- Convulsions  
\- Syncope  
\- Lethargy  
**  
Benefits of an administration of exogenous glucocorticoid:**\- Vascular tone and maintenance of BP  
\- Catecholamine synthesis and secretion  
\- Myocardial contractility  
**Vascular tone and maintenance of blood pressure:**  
\- They have a permissive effect on vascular tone and maintenance of blood pressure.  
\- When administered with a vasopressor, glucocorticoids enhance vascular reactivity to vasopressors.  
  
**Catecholamine synthesis and secretion:  
**\- Cortisol is involved in catecholamine synthesis and mediates the release of catecholamine from sympathetic nerve cells.  
  
**\- Myocardial contractility:  
**\- In patients with hemodynamically unstable secondary adrenal insufficiency (AI), supplemental IV increases the stroke work index of the LV.**Indications for stress dose:  
Prediction of suppressed HPA axis patients:**  
**\- Patients who should be assumed to have functional suppression of their HPA include:**  
\- Any patient who is currently taking more than 20 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent (e.g., 16 mg/day of methylprednisolone, 2 mg/day of dexamethasone, or 80 mg/day of hydrocortisone) for more than three weeks.  
\- Patients currently taking doses of 5 to 20 mg of prednisone (or its equivalent) for more than three weeks.  
\- On steroids with signs or symptoms of Cushing disease  
\- All routes of administration (oral, inhaled, topical, intranasal, intra-articular) can cause suppression of the HPA axis.  
  
**Prophylaxis dose:  
**\- An optimal stress dose has not been established.\- **Popular dose among anesthesia providers:** 100 mg of Solu-Cortef IV, preferably with intraoperative induction.  
\- 200 mg a day over the next two days  
**Possible side-effects of exogenous perioperative glucocorticoids:**  
\- Hyperglycemia  
\- Hypertension  
\- Fluid retention  
\- Edema  
\- Increased risk of infection (delayed wound healing)  
\- Confusion  
**  
Glucocorticoids have mineralocorticoid properties:**  
\- Glucocorticoids have mineralocorticoid properties that may result in dose-dependent edema/fluid retention and hypokalemia.  
\- If a patient requires a dose greater than 100 mg of Solu-Cortef, consider switching to methylprednisolone because it has a higher glucocorticoid to mineralocorticoid activity ratio.

Treatment for adrenal crises:  
**\- If the diagnosis for adrenal crises is made in time, it can easily be managed simply by administering 100 mg **Solu-Cortef (hydrocortisone) IV.  
****\- Repeat doses vary  
****\- Note:** Historically, 200-300 mg of hydrocortisone doses were a standard recommendation.  
  
_\- A coinciding presence of hypovolemia, hyperkalemia, and hyponatremia may also need to be addressed.  
_**\- When AI is not recognized, the condition may cause severe morbidity and be fatal.**
