### Thyroidectomy (Subtotal and Total)

The surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid gland.

This is a basic neck case where you want a smooth wake up without any coughing (bucking).

**Pre-op:** We want the patient euthyroid with resting HR < 85bpm. The patient should still get his/her antithyroid and beta-blocker meds in the am. Intra-op: Monitor the BP and temperature closely. Protect the eyes. Elevate head 15-20, helps venous drainage and decreases blood loss.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT.  
Check with the surgeon about relaxation. In the past, we usually did not paralyze these patients. The surgeon would utilize the muscle twitching to help identify and avoid the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Today more surgeons appear to do fine identifying the nerve with the patient relaxed.  
 

**NIMs EMG ETT:** Sometimes the surgeon will require you to use a NIMS endotube. They are not used as much anymore. Some of the older surgeons still use them. If the surgeon wants to use the NIMs ETT, then you know he/she will NOT want the patient relaxed.  
**Glide Scope intubation:** If there is any question about the airway with a goiter or mass, use the glide scope. However, most of the patients receive a thyroidectomy long before the airway is compromised.  
**LTA kit:** Optional. Despite some literature references, the NIMs ETT works fine after an LTA kit is used.  
**Muscle Relaxants:** Depends if the surgeon desires relaxation. Anectine or a low dose of Rocuronium will have worn off by the time the surgeon needs to visualize the muscle twitching and is near an important nerve.

**Duration:** 1-3 hours. Depends on the surgeon.  
**Position:** Supine, arms tucked, shoulder roll with foam donut instead of a pillow with head slightly extended back.  
**Neo Drip:** Yes, make sure you connect it before the arm is tucked and it also flows after the arm is tucked. If you are not relaxing the patient, you will have to run your gases higher and we know this causes hypotension.  
**Toradol vs Ofirmev:** Ofirmev is your choice of analgesic. The surgeon will blame any hematoma on the Toradol.  
**Antiemetics:** Yes  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable. Make sure it runs well after the arm is tucked.  
**A-Line**: Usually not.    
**EBL**: Minimal  
**Emergence:**  If not contraindicated, extubate deep and avoid coughing.  
**Possible Complications**  
Hematoma formation under the incision. A rapidly enlarging hematoma can obstruct the airway. There is a 1:300 risk of bleeding. This is the main reason the patient stays overnight in the hospital. Recurrent laryngeal nerve, injury  
Hypoparathyroidism, hypothyroidism  
Thyrotoxic storm  
Superior laryngeal nerve injury  
Wound infection  

  
**Pre-op**: We want the patient euthyroid with resting HR < 85bpm.  
The patient should still get his/her antithyroid and beta blocker meds in the am.

**Intra-op:** Monitor the BP and temperature closely. Protect the eyes. Elevate head 15-20, helps venous drainage and decreases blood loss.

In America, we rarely see thyroid storms or huge goiters anymore. We mostly just read about them. So just be aware!

The surgeon has to be aware of the Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve. Old literature talks about viewing the cords and checking for nerve damage via direct laryngoscopy before extubation. We rarely do that anymore.

Some surgeons prefer a NIMs (Nerve Integrity Monitor) EMG ETT tube to help locate and protect them from damaging the Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve. Make sure you correctly place it with intubation. Find out if surgeon uses a shoulder roll.

We usually do not use Toradol for neck cases.  
Anti-emetics, an oral gastric tube and an extubation without coughing are important. These patients are admitted to watch for airway issues due to risk of post op bleeding.
