### Brachioplasty (Arm Lift)

_Can be with or without liposuction_  
A surgery that reshapes the back part of the upper arm, from arm to elbow.  
This procedure removes the extra skin and tissue from the upper arm.  
  
Arm lift is one of the top four most popular plastic surgery procedures performed following massive weight loss, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.  
Many of the patients who lose 150 or more pounds develop a contour deformity similar to a bat’s wing that extends from the olecranon across the axilla.  
Some patients may only require minimal incisions where the inner, upper arm joins the armpit. This is known as a minimal incision arm lift. A patient may be a candidate for a minimal incision arm lift if they have a small amount of extra skin located near the armpit.

**Procedure**  
Depending on the presence of stubborn fatty tissue in the upper arm area, the surgeon may use liposuction as an adjunct procedure to eliminate excess fat.  
  
A long incision length is needed to adequately resect the ptotic skin of the arm and because of the laxity of skin within the axilla and chest-wall region that predisposes to postoperative contour deformities.  
  
Depending on the presence of stubborn fatty tissue in the upper arm area, the surgeon may use liposuction as an adjunct procedure to eliminate excess fat. Tumescent technique may be used to suction out the unwanted fat in a less invasive manner through the incisions.  
  
Excess skin will then be trimmed away, and the incisions will be brought together to create a smoother and firmer arm contour. Finally, the remaining skin will be smoothly re-draped over the new arm contour.  
  
The surgeon will then apply a sterile dressing to cover the incisions and place a compression garment. Temporary drain tubes may be placed beneath the skin in the incision areas for a few days.  
  
**Indications
