### Exploratory Laparotomy (Exploratory Lap)

(Diagnostic Laparotomy)  

Laparotomy is a surgical procedure performed on the abdomen using a full-size incision. The larger incision allows the surgeon to better visualize the organs, blood vessels and tissues in the abdominal cavity.

This procedure is often used for obtaining information that is not available via clinical diagnostic methods. The surgeon is basically exploring.

Once the surgeon finds the underlying pathology, he/she will usually repair the problem while the belly is open. So now it becomes a therapeutic procedure.

**Pre-Op**  
The most important thing you need to do is find out why the procedure is being done so you could tailor your anesthesia.  
If a bowel obstruction is suspected, you need to plan your anesthesia as a bowel obstruction. **See Bowel obstruction.**  
If there is air in the abdomen-you can expect a perforated bowel. These patients tend to be very sick.

Is the stomach distended? That is never a good sign. Always talk to the surgeon.

These cases may be a quick easy observation to a very long repairing procedure.

  
**Anesthesia:** General/RSI  
**Duration:** 1-4 hours  
**Position:** Supine with both arms out   
**IV Access:** 1-2 18G  (open belly)

**A-line:** Depends on the illness of the patient  
**Neo drip:** Have available  
**OGT:** Check with the surgeon. Many times they will request an NG Tube.  
**Hydration:** These patients can be hypovolemic, especially if they had a bowel prep. To replace the post Bowel Prep fluid deficit, we usually administer 1 liter of crystalloids. Some literature states to replace a bowel prep with 500 mLs - 2 liters  
  
**Some literature states to hydrate third space fluid losses with: Open Abdomen:** 12-15cc/kg 1st hour then 6-10cc/kg/hr.  
  
**Albumin:** More commonly administered for the longer procedures.  
**EBL:** Varies on the diagnosis  
Many of these procedures tend to be a type of colon resection with not much EBL.  
 

**Possible Indications of an Exploratory Lap**  
Unexplained Abdominal or Pelvic Pain  
Perforated intestine  
Bowel obstruction  
if cancer is suspected, biopsies may be obtained

**Liver**: Trauma, cirrhosis, liver enlargement  
**Urinary System-Kidneys, Ureters and Bladder**: Blockages, cancer, trauma  
**Female Reproductive System**: Endometriosis, cancer, ectopic pregnancy, inflammation  
**Spleen**: Trauma, spleen enlargement, rupture  
**Pancreas**: Inflammation of the pancreas, cancer  
Adhesions from previous procedures  
Abscess

**Why Exploratory Laps are becoming more rare**  
Increasing availability of sophisticated imaging modalities (CTs and MRIs) and other investigative techniques leave less guessing by the surgeon.  
  
**For cancer**  
A pelvic washing may be performed; sterile fluid is instilled into the abdominal cavity and washed around the abdominal organs, then withdrawn and analyzed for the presence of abnormal cells. This may indicate metastasis.

**Closure**  
Upon completion of any exploration or procedures, the organs and related structures are returned to their normal anatomical position. The incision may then be sutured (stitched closed). The layers of the abdominal wall are sutured in reverse order, and the skin incision closed with sutures or staples.

**Possible Complications:**  
PONV  
Bleeding  
Infection  
Injury to abdominal organs or structures  
Formation of adhesions
