Omphalocele Anesthesia   

### Omphalocele Anesthesia

  
_By Dina Velocci CRNA_

**Surgical Procedure**  
The abdominal viscera are replaced into the abdominal cavity and the abdominal wall is closed.

_  
Lucky for us, most infants with abdominal wall defects have been medically managed in the NICU with ventilator management, cardiovascular assessment, and labs treated._

**Preoperative assessment**  
Find out the gestational age, the birth history and whether the baby has had vitamin K. Premature neonates may require surfactant administration. The baby will generally be NPO, but check!

  
**Airway assessment:** Difficult intubation in neonates may be associated with micrognathia or abnormal tissues (large tongue in Beckwith Wiedeman syndrome). Babies may be electively intubated for transfer to a specialized center – check the size and position of the tracheal tube and make sure it is securely fixed.

  
**Respiratory assessment** is essential as respiratory compromise may occur with reduction of the abdominal contents into the abdomen. Exomphalos major is associated with a scaphoid abdomen and small thorax.  
Respiratory distress may present with signs of increased work of breathing – tachypnea (normal RR 30-40 breaths per minute), tachycardia (normal HR 120-180 bpm), and nasal flaring – or apnea.  
Check oxygen saturation; distressed infants may de-saturate on routine handling.  
CXR may indicate intrapulmonary shadowing suggesting aspiration of infection; note the position of the tracheal tube and NG tube if present.

  
**Cardiovascular** assessment should be performed.

Obtain an echocardiogram preoperatively.

A ruptured exomphalos may present with significant fluid loss requiring fluid resuscitation. Assess the baby clinically – skin perfusion and capillary refill (should be instantaneous if the baby is well filled).  
Check the history of HR and BP, blood gases if available.  
Fluid resuscitation may be required – 20ml/kg, reassess and repeat.  
A baby requiring significant volume resuscitation should be electively intubated.

Examine the baby for associated abnormalities, especially if an exomphalos is present.

Cardiac assessment should be performed to exclude associated cardiac defects.  
**Important things to note in the newborn include**:  
Abnormal pulses (absent femoral pulse in coarctation)  
Low BP  
Central cyanosis (pulse oximetry)  
Signs of heart failure (poor feeding, excessive weight gain, poor perfusion, tachycardia, tachypnea, gallop rhythm, hepatomegaly, cardiomegaly on CXR), +/- a heart murmur (but significant lesions may not be associated with a murmur in the neonatal period).  
  
Ideally, a cardiology opinion should be sought and a cardiac echo already performed.

Check the weight of the baby

Check the drug chart and fluid chart.  
Antibiotic prophylaxis is required (e.g. metronidazole and benzyl penicillin)

**Investigations:**  
CBC and cross-match of one adult unit of blood.

ABGs to assess the adequacy of resuscitation and ventilation.  
Check urea & electrolytes

Chest X-ray for all infants with cardiorespiratory symptoms

Echocardiogram

Renal ultrasound, especially if syndrome present

Head ultrasound scan to exclude intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants prior to surgery.

**Pre-anesthetic management**  
No sedative premedication; consider administering atropine prior to induction.

Discuss anesthesia plan with the parents if present – identify any relevant family history and obtain consent for anesthesia.

**Prepare equipment** :  
3.0-3.5mm ETT for a term newborn  
2.5mm ETT for a premature infant.  
Straight blade laryngoscope (O Miller or 1 Wisconsin)  
Infant facemask and Guedel airway.

Make sure all drugs drawn up in appropriate dose.

A burette should be used for intravenous fluids

Make sure atropine is drawn up and available.

Warm the theatre to 25-26˚C – prepare active warming device for the baby (overhead heater, hot air mattress) and for intravenous fluids.

Prepare materials to keep the baby well covered.

Transfer the baby to theatre in a warmed incubator; minimize exposure of the baby in theatre (remember to keep head covered).

Remind the surgeon to keep the bowel covered with warm swabs during surgery.

**IV Access:** Your patient will already have one. Immediately check the patency.  
**Note:** IV access in the upper limbs is preferable (avoid lower extremities) as abdominal pressure may restrict venous return temporarily post operatively. Place a second one after induction.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT, usually 3.0-3.5 ETT  
Many times the patient may already be intubated.  
**Regional:** An epidural or caudal catheter requires an experienced anesthetist but provides very good intra and postoperative analgesia and has the added benefit of abdominal wall relaxation. Hepatic clearance of local anesthetics may be reduced if there is any abdominal compression. Hepatic clearance of local anesthetics may be reduced if there is any abdominal compression.  
**Induction** : RSI. Do not mask ventilate!  
Pre-oxygenate with 100% oxygen and aspirate the nasogastric tube to decompress the stomach prior to induction.  
**Airway issues:** May be a difficult intubation if associated with Beckwith Wiedeman syndrome.  
**Nitrous:** Avoided to prevent further bowel distension  
**Intraoperative narcotics:** Fentanyl (3-5mcg/kg) or morphine if postoperative ventilation is anticipated (20-100mcg/kg).  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Yes, for surgical reduction and to facilitate abdominal closure.

Cisatracurium (0.5mg/kg) is the muscle relaxant of choice, as it does not rely on renal or hepatic function for its metabolism.

**Ventilation**

-   Monitor airway pressures throughout the case, especially when bowel is placed back in abdomen. Communicate with surgeon. As abdominal pressures increase,  
    increased thoracic pressure (PIP) can compress ICV, impeding venous return.  
      
    
-   Abdominal pressure may also lead to decreased intestinal, renal, and hepatic perfusion, altering drug metabolism and prolonged drug effect. Some surgeons may measure bladder or intragastric pressures.

Monitor labs appropriately for chemistries/glucose and ABG’s (metabolic acidosis).

**Position** : Supine  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours

**A-Line:** May already have one if there is associated cardiac defects.  
**Age Range:** Newborn  
**Foley:** Should already have one  
**EBL** : 5-10mL/kg (should have 1 adult unit of PRBs on standby)  
Fluid replacements approach 15-25 ml/kg for hemodynamic stability.

A manometer line may be placed in the bladder or stomach if primary closure is contemplated to monitor intra-abdominal pressure.

Aggressive fluid resuscitation is advised.

**Hydration: 4:2:1** **(below is just a common reference)**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**Third space fluid loss:** May be significant, give fluid boluses of 10-20ml/kg and assess clinically via HR, BP, capillary refill, base excess, Hb

Maintain 1-2 mg/kg/hr UOP.

**Blood Bolus dose:** 10-20cc/kg if needed.  
Transfuse as guided by ABL calculations and drawing H/H. (we try to maintain the Hgb approcimately 10-12 g/dl).  
**  
Blood Transfusion  
**Maintain the Hb at approximately 10-12 g/dl: (4ml/kg packed cells raises the Hb by 1g/dl).  
Alternatively, transfuse when 10% blood loss has occurred, guided by weighing swabs etc. and clinical parameters.  
Platelets and FFP are given in 10ml/kg aliquots if the platelet count or coagulation screen is abnormal.  
Cryoprecipitate is transfused in 5ml/kg aliquots if the fibrinogen levels are low.

  
**Emergence:**  
Some babies with small defects can breathe spontaneously after surgery but the majority require ventilation due to the increased intra-abdominal pressure with compromised respiratory function.  
  
**Remember:** A manometer line may be placed in the bladder or stomach if primary closure is contemplated to monitor intra-abdominal pressure.

**Extubation:**  
All neonates that are able to be extubated should be reversed with neostigmine and glycopyrolate. Neonates should only be extubated when they are fully awake, with regular spontaneous breathing and vigorous movements of all limbs, well saturated and with stable hemodynamics.  
It is also common leave the patient intubated and weaned over 1-2 days.

**Possible Complications:  
**Respiratory Failure  
Bowel ischemia/necrosis  
Paralytic ileus-lack of bowel activity  
Bowel obstruction due to scar tissue or a kink in a loop of bowel  
Renal Failure  
Peritonitis  
Sepsis/metabolic acidosis  
Pneumothorax  
RDS  
Atelectasis  
Volume overload/pulmonary edema  
GERD as a result of the increase in the abdominal pressure caused by the closure of the smaller than normal abdominal cavity  
Perioperative hypothermia  
Inguinal hernia (later) because of the high abdominal pressure

**Postoperative fluid management:**  
Fluids should be restricted to 60% maintenance immediately postoperatively.  
Fluid restriction will already be in place if surgery is on the first day of life.

Check fluid balance and electrolytes to determine subsequent fluid requirements. 10% dextrose or 4% dextrose 0.18% saline is used initially, but gastrointestinal losses should be replaced with 0.9% saline ml for ml; only isotonic fluids should be used for correction of hypovolemia.

Colloids (gelatins, starch, albumin, depending on local preference) may be used to replace third space losses, including those following placement of an abdominal wall silo.

**Daily maintenance fluid**  
◦ Day 1 60ml/kg/day  
◦ Day2 90ml/kg/day  
◦ Day 3 120ml/kg/day  
◦ Day 4 150 ml/kg/day  
◦ Day 5 150ml/kg/day

**Glucose Control**  
Newborn babies less than 48hrs, especially premature, small for gestational age and those born to diabetic mothers are prone to hypoglycemia. It is important to measure blood glucose levels regularly and to treat hypoglycemia with 1-2ml/kg of 10% glucose. Some may require a continuous infusion of glucose.

**Continued management in NICU**  
Neonates with exomphalos major or gastroschisis may require mechanical ventilation due to temporary deterioration of lung function due to the raised intra-abdominal pressure; some may require muscle relaxation for 24hrs. Body temperature needs to be measured and maintained. Analgesia is provided with intravenous morphine or an epidural infusion of local anesthetic. Acetaminophen (10mg/kg) 6 hourly IV/PR should also be administered; note smaller dose in neonates than children.

A prolonged ileus is expected and total parenteral nutrition is administered until full feeds are established. Despite adequate volume replacement, hypotension may persist, and dopamine infusion is often needed to maintain a normal blood pressure and urine output (if infant severely compromised peri-operatively). Early complications include: necrotizing enterocolitis, renal insufficiency, pneumonia, patent ductus arteriosus, cellulitis of the abdominal wall, abdominal wall breakdown, gastroesophageal reflux and cholestasis.

**Conclusion**  
Neonates with abdominal wall defects require particular attention to:  
• Fluid resuscitation and temperature control  
• Overenthusiastic attempts by surgeons to close the defect inevitable causes a decrease in blood pressure and cardiac output and may interfere with ventilation; the surgeon should be alerted and a silo should be placed with a delayed closure.  
• Some infants with omphalocele have gastroesophageal reflux as a result of the increase in the abdominal pressure caused by the closure of the smaller than normal abdominal cavity. In a few patients, an antireflux operation may be necessary. There is also an increased risk of inguinal hernia because of the high abdominal pressure.
