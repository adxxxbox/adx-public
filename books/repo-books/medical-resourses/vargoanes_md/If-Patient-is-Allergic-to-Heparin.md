### If Patient is Allergic to Heparin

**Angiomax:**  
Is replacing heparin as the current standard anticoagulant used in PTCAs.  
Is a specific and reversible direct thrombin inhibitor.  
Is an anticoagulant.  
  
Published data suggested that an Angiomax bolus of 1 mg/kg would result in an ACT of approximately 350 seconds.  
  
A repeat bolus of 50 mg (0.5 mg/kg) and an increase in the infusion rate to 5 mg/kg per hour resulted in a rise in the ACT to 322.  
  
Angiomax has a half-life of approximately 25 min in patients with normal renal function.  
  
The main clinical drawback of bivalirudin (Angiomax) is that it has no known antidote.  
  
Assessment of anticoagulation status during cardiac surgery can be valuable for novel therapeutics, including direct thrombin inhibitors. The ecarin clotting time (ECT) has been reported to be sensitive for monitoring of bivalirudin in cardiac surgery but is not as commonly commercially available. The activated clotting time (ACT), commonly used for heparin monitoring, may display a lack of sensitivity to alternative anticoagulants when used in on-pump cardiac surgery.  
  
Bivalirudin is a direct thrombin inhibitor with linear pharmacokinetics and dynamics. It is effective against fluid phase and clot bound thrombin and is alleged to inhibit protease-activated receptor (PAR)-mediated activation of platelets.  
  
**Clinical Outcomes**  
Procedural success rates at 7 days post-discharge were 94.9% in the bivalirudin group and 96.2% in the heparin group.  
  
Major bleeding events at day 7 post-discharge occurred in 6.1% of bivalirudin patients and 1.9% of patients who received heparin/protamine.  
  
The postoperative re-exploration rate in the bivalirudin group contributed to the difference in bleeding events between groups.  
  
The rate of transfusions in the bivalirudin group was 58.2% vs 59.6% in the heparin/protamine group.
