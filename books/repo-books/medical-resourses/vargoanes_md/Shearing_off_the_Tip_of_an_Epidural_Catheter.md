### Shearing off the Tip of an Epidural Catheter

  
Daniel D. Moos, CRNA

Never attempt to withdraw an epidural catheter back through the needle. Pull both the needle and catheter out at the same time. When removing an epidural catheter, use steady pressure. Do not stretch or jerk the catheter. If difficulty in removing the catheter is encountered, have the patient curl up in a ball in a lateral decubitus position. This position should maximize the intervertebral space and allow for catheter removal. Steady, gentle pressure should allow the catheter to be removed in its entirety.  
  
If the epidural catheter shears or breaks off in the epidural space, it should be left in place. Observe the patient for complications. If the catheter breaks outside of the epidural space, in superficial tissue, it should be surgically removed. A remnant of an epidural catheter in superficial tissue can result in infection.
