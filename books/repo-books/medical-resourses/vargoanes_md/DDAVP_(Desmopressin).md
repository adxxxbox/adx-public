### DDAVP (Desmopressin)

**Synthetic vasopressin (DDAVP, Desmopressin) for Anticoagulated Bleeding Patients  
**_Originally designed for the treatment of diabetes insipidus - not discussed here.  
  
NOTE: DDAVP and Demopressin are both trade names._  
  
**Why Desmopressin is so beneficial with bleeding patients**  
Overall platelet function is significantly increased.  
Raises Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and FVIII levels by 3-5‐fold.  
Low record of adverse effects with nonbleeding patients.  
  
Drug induced bleeding disorders, especially by antiplatelet anticoagulants, can be treated successfully with Desmopressin (Levi et al. 2011).  
  
Theoretically, Desmopressin can also be used in attempt to help control acute bleeding caused by the novel anticoagulants (Brem et al. 2013).  
  
DDAVP and tranexamic acid are both gaining popularity for the early treatment in reversing anticoagulation in bleeding patients that who are anticoagulated.  
  
DDAVP was revolutionized for the treatment of bleeding disorders, leading to a marked reduction in the use of blood products for the prevention and treatment of bleeding episodes.  
  
**Documented Desmopressin doses for anticoagulated patients**  
An option for the reversal of ASA at 0.3mcg/kg (for intracranial hemorrhage).  
An option for the reversal of Plavix at 0.3mcg/kg (for intracranial hemorrhage).  
(The role of anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and their reversal strategies in the management of intracerebral hemorrhage).**  
  
Treatment option for minor bleeding patients on the following antiplatelets:**  
Aspirin: Minor – desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg x 1.  
Clopidogrel (Plavix) Minor – desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg x 1.  
Prasugrel (Effient) Minor – desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg x 1.  
Ticagrelor (Brilinta®) Minor – desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg x 1.  
Sustained Release Aspirin/Dipyridamole (Aggrenox®) Minor – desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg x 1.  
Eptifibatide (Integrilin®) Minor – desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg x 1Tirofiban (Aggrastat®) Minor – desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg x 1.

**Reversal/treatment options  
**Dabigatran - 0.3mcg/kg SQ or IV; limit to 2 IV doses, Increased risk of tachyphylaxis.  
Apixaban - 0.3mcg/kg SQ or IV; limit to 2 IV doses, Increased risk of tachyphylaxis.  
Rivaroxaban - 0.3mcg/kg SQ or IV; limit to 2 IV doses, Increased risk of tachyphylaxis.

**Dosing and administration  
**Can be administered via intravenous, subcutaneous and intranasal routes.  
The dose for both intravenous and subcutaneous routes is 0.3 mcg/kg.  
Dilute in normal saline and infuse over 15–30 minutes.The dilution volume of normal saline is 15–30 ml for children and 50–100 ml for adults.  
  
**Doses and preparations of desmopressin  
Intranasal:** Stimate 150 mcg for < 50 kg (one spray into one nostril).  
300 mcg > 50 Kg (one spray each nostril).  
  
**Intravenous:** 0.3 μg/kg body weight diluted in normal saline (15–30 ml for children, 50–100 ml for adults) and given over 15–30 minutes.  
**Subcutaneous:** 0.3 mcg/kg  
  
**More Notes  
**Desmopressin (DDAVP), a vasopressin analog.**  
  
Mechanism of action  
**Increases circulating levels of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor (vWf) by stimulating the release of von Willebrand factor from the endothelial cells (within the walls of blood vessels).  
The increase in adhesiveness of platelets to the damaged subendothelial vessel wall and the augmentation of platelet aggregation by DDAVP has proven to be efficacious in von Willebrand Disease and platelet disorders.  
  
**When vWF levels increase  
**vWF redirects circulating platelets to sites of vascular injury essential for platelet plug formation.  
In plasma, vWF forms a complex with Factor VIII and protects it from inactivation and clearance.  
  
**Two advantages of DDAVP  
**Quick onset-1 hour, similarity to cryoprecipitate.  
Lack of transfusion-related side effects.  
  
**Peak effect:** 30-60 minutes after intravenous infusion, and 60–90 minutes after an intranasal or subcutaneous dose.High levels of FVIII and VWF are maintained for 6–8 hours.  
  
**Duration: <** 24 hours; patients are likely to develop tachyphylaxis after a single dose of DDAVP, limiting its utility for repeated dosing. A second dose within 48 hours of the first dose will have reduced response because intracellular stores must be replenished.  
  
**Other effects:** Vasodilator; increases the release of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).  
Interestingly, tPA is a molecule involved in fibrinolysis and therefore acts in opposition to the effects of VWF.  
Reduces postoperative blood loss following cardiac surgery.  
  
**Possible Adverse Effects  
**Water intoxication.  
Hyponatremia.  
Transient hypotension.  
  
**Contraindications  
**Moderate to severe renal impairment.  
Hypersensitivity to DDAVP.
