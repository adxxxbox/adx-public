### Lower Rhytidectomy (Neck Lift)

A neck lift is a surgical procedure that improves visible signs of aging in the jawline and neck.  
  
**Goal:** To erase the signs of sagging neck skin, reduce “turkey” neck and leave the patient with a cosmetically improved throat and neckline.  
  
**Open neck lift:** The most common. This procedure is often performed in tandem with a facelift or mini facelift.  
  
The critical angle between the jaw and the beginning of the neck, also called the “cervicomental angle,” is re-formed to restore youthfulness and vitality to the profile.  
  
**What neck lift surgery can treat**  
Excess fat and skin relaxation in the lower face that creates jowls  
Excess fatty deposits under the chin  
Loose neck skin  
Muscle banding in the neck, which creates abnormal contours  
  
**Procedure**  
The surgeon makes an incision in the hairline at the level of the sideburn, continues down and around the ear and ends in the posterior hair.  
Fat may be sculpted or redistributed from the jowls and neck.  
The tissue underlying the neck skin is repositioned, and commonly the platysma muscle is tightened.  
Skin is re-draped over the uplifted contours and excess skin is trimmed away.  
A separate incision under the chin is often necessary for liposuction of this area and for repair of the muscle.  
  
**The endoscopic neck lift:**  
This procedure is ideal for those patients who do not have an abundance of excess neck skin, but rather the vertical bands of platysma muscle in the neck have lost their elasticity, adding years to a person’s perceived age. During the endoscopic neck lift, a small fiber optic camera is inserted on the end of a probe via tiny incisions in the neck. This provides a view of the area for improvement on a video monitor for a high degree of accuracy and detail in re-forming imperfections.  
  
**Lower Rhytidectomy with lower facelift**  
In women, a lower facelift and neck lift are usually performed together.  
In men, a neck lift can be performed without a lower facelift.  
  
**Anesthesia:** This procedure alone may not require anesthesia, just localization by the surgeon or a MAC case.  
General anesthesia when combined with a facelift.  
Patients with chronic neck or back pain, medical health issues, and those having multiple procedures performed would be better served having a general anesthesia.  
**Position:** Supine  
**Duration:** Approximately 2 hours  
**EBL:** Minimal  
  
**Possible Complications**  
Bleeding  
Temporary or permanent hair loss along the incisions  
Facial asymmetry  
Rare nerve injury that could cause weakness of the lower lip  
Fluid accumulation or hematoma  
  
**Infection**  
Unfavorable scarring  
Prolonged swelling  
Skin irregularities and discoloration  
Skin loss  
Sutures may spontaneously surface through the skin, become visible or produce irritation and require removal  
Numbness or other changes in skin sensation  
Persistent pain  
Poor wound healing  
Rare risk of deep venous thrombosis with cardiac or pulmonary sequelae.
