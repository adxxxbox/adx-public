### Factor VIII Deficiency-Hemophilia A (Congenital)

Also referred to as classic hemophilia.  
  
**Hemophilia A** is a factor VIII deficiency.  
Hemophilia B is a factor IX deficiency (Christmas Disease)  
Hemophilia C is a factor XI deficiency.  
  
Hemophilia A is the most common type of hemophilia: 80% (B and C are less common).  
Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive hereditary hemorrhagic disease, causing deficiency of functional plasma clotting factor VIII.  
Hemorrhagic complications may occur if perioperative hemostatic preparation is inadequate or is poorly planned.  
Hemophilia A can also arise from spontaneous mutation.  
Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive heredity disorder in males and is transmitted by heterozygous females for the gene mutation**  
  
Incidence of hemophilia A:**  
About 1 in 5,000-10,000 males.  
**In US:** 1:20,000  
**Severe form:** Found in 7 out of 10 with the disease.  
  
**Possible Manifestations of** **Hemophilia A (prolonged bleeding and re-bleeds)  
**Hemophiliacs do not bleed more intensely than normal but can bleed for much longer period. When a blood vessel is injured, missing coagulation factors prevent fibrin formation which is necessary to maintain the blood clot.  
In severe hemophiliacs, even minor injuries could result in blood loss lasting for days, weeks or not ever healing completely.  
Prolonged bleeding with circumcision, dental work and surgery.  
Muscle hematomas  
Generalized joint pain - hemophilic arthopathy: recurrent bleeding into joints which may result in orthopedic procedures throughout life.   
Intracranial hemorrhage is the most common cause of death.  
  
**Lab results with Hemophilia A**  
Prolongation of PT, aPTT  
Normal bleeding time  
Normal Thrombin Time  
Decreased levels of FX antigen or FX activity  
Russell viper venom time (RVVT) is prolonged and may help differentiate factor VII and X deficiency as this agent activates factor X directly.  
  
**Classification of Hemophilia A**  
Classification is according to baseline level of clotting factor VIII activity.   
Factor VIII activity levels are reported in units with 1 U/ml corresponding to 100% of factor found in 1 ml of normal plasma.  
Levels of normal plasma activity: 0.5 U/ml - 1.5 U/ml (50-150%).

| Life threatening hemorrhage | 60-100 | Repeat Q 8-24 hours  
until threat is resolved |
| Major bleed including  
neurosurgery | 80-100 (pre- and post-operative) | Repeat Q 8-24 hours until adequate healing,  
then therapy for at least 7 days to maintain  
factor VIII activity of 30-60% (IU/dl) |

Knight et al reported that FX levels of 9-17 % are required to prevent minor bleeding in response to normal everyday knocks or injuries.  
In patients with severe FX deficiency who present for emergency surgery for hemoperitoneum, 35-50% levels of FX is needed to achieve hemostasis during surgery and levels need to be maintained between 10 to 20% for 6 days postoperatively.  
**Hemophilia A and Surgery  
**Hematology consult  
All the patients with hemophilia, regardless of the severity of the disease, are at risk of excessive bleeding during surgery.**New medication for Hemophilia A  
Hemlibra (emicizumab) for Hemophilia A with or without inhibitors**  
**Hemlibra** is a recombinant, humanized, bispecific immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody that substitutes for part of the cofactor function of activated factor VIII (FVIIIa) by bridging activated factor IX(FIXa) and factor X(FX).  
**Indications:** Routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adults and children of all ages, newborn and older, with hemophilia A with and without factor VIII inhibitors.  
**Doses:** Loading dose of 3 mg/kg weekly for 4 doses, followed by one of three subsequent long-term dose regimens: either 1.5 mg/kg weekly or 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, or 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks.  
_There is significant reduction in annualized bleeding rates at all doses for all age groups, with or without inhibitors._    
**Route:** SubQ**A documented Hematologists Perioperative Plan with Hemophilia A** without HemlibraMaintain close to 100% factor VIII concentration on the day of surgery and first 2 postoperative days;  
75% on day 3, 4, and 5; and then 50% for next 5 days.  
  
If the patient received a test dose of factor VIII preoperatively, the response to the test dose should be evaluated.  
Consider desmopressin 0.3 mcg/kg can be administered for mild to moderate hemophilia.  
  
**Possible Pre-op Labs** (should be previously ordered by consulting hematologist)  
Type and crossed-matched  
CBC  
aPTT/PT/INR  
BMP  
Platelet count and function  
FVIII  
Fibrinogen activity (Clauss assay)  
Factor VIII inhibitor screening  
  
**New onset of hemophilia should also have:**  
Hepatitis C virus (HCV)  
ALT, AST, HCV antibody  
HCV genotype  
HIV antibody  
HCV and HIV viral loads are only required if patients have tested positive for the respective antibody.  
  
**Does the hemophiliac patient have circulating inhibitors? (hematology decision)  
**Pre-operatively, there should already be a diagnosis for the presence of factor VIII inhibitors.This is assessed by the patient’s hematologist with a lab test: “mixing study.”  
The presence of factor VIII inhibitors will determine if the patient will be treated with factor VIII concentrate or an inhibitor bypass drug PCC or recombinant factor VIIa (NovoSeven).  
  
**Factor VIII Inhibitors  
**Up to 30% of patients with severe hemophilia A who have previously received factor VIII concentrate or recombinant factor VIIa will develop inhibitor molecules (antibodies) against factor VIII (hemophilia A inhibitor patients). This makes it difficult to treat the patient with factor VIII.  
  
**Hemophilia A inhibitor patients –Low and High Responders  
Low responders:** Have low titers of inhibitors and respond to factor VIII concentrate.  
Larger initial and maintenance doses of factor VIII concentrate will be required and frequent factor VIII assays need to be monitored  
**Factor VIII replacement equation:** Required units = body weight (kg) × desired factor VIII rise (%) × 0.5.  
Factor VIII should be infused slowly at a rate not more than 2 ml/minute.  
**High responders:** Have high titers with a poor response to factor VIII concentrate.  
  
**High responders will require an inhibitor bypassing drug:**  
Activated prothrombin complex concentrates or  
Recombinant factor VIIa (NovoSeven)-successful in 80% of patients with inhibitors.  
  
**NovoSeven doses:** 90-120 mcg/kg pre-op, then Q2 hours for the first 28 hours.  
**FEIBA (factor VIII inhibitor bypassing agent):** 75-100 units/kg, then 70 units/kg every 6-8 hours for 3 days are FDA approved for hemophilia A inhibitor patients.  
  
A severe hemophilia-like syndrome can occur in genetically normal people because if the appearance of an acquired autoantibody to either factor VIII or IX.  
  
**Mild hemophilia A (Factor VIII activity level > 5-40%) with NO factor VIII inhibitors  
**Intranasal or IV of DDAVP (Desmopressin) may be sufficient.  
**DDAVP Dose:** 0.3 mcg/kg 30 minutes prior to surgery.  
**DDAVP** : Acts by releasing VWF which in turn forms a complex with factor VIII, thereby preventing its breakdown. It is commonly used for the treatment of mild form of hemophilia A and VWD.  
DDAVP also produces a two- to five-fold increase in factor VIII levels which may be sufficient for minor surgery in mild hemophilia.  
These patients should have had a previous trial demonstrating an adequate response to DDAVP.  
Tranexamic acid is optional.  
**  
Moderate to Severe Hemophilia with NO factor VIII inhibitors  
**Factor VIII concentrate-pre-op and up to 2 weeks post-op.  
Factor VIII should be infused slowly at a rate not more than 2 ml/minute.Half-life of factor VIII is 12 hours. Repeated infusions are required every 8-12 hours in order to keep factor VIII levels > 50%.  
In children the half-life is shorter and requires more frequent transfusions.  
Peak and trough levels of factor VIII must be monitored  
  
FFP and cryoprecipitate may also correct FVIII levels.  
  
**FFP:** 1 ml of FFP will provide one unit of factor VIII activity.**Cryoprecipitate:** Contains FVIII, von Willebrand factor and fibrinogen. Can be used when FVIII concentrates are NOT available.  
30-40 ml of cryoprecipitate provides 80 U of factor VIII.  
  
**Antifibrinolytics:** aminocaproic acid (Amicar) or tranexamic acid as adjunctive therapy for bleeding from the mucous membranes or dental procedures.  
The administration of 2 gm IV of Tranexamic acid on the day of surgery and continued postoperatively has been documented.  
  
Surgery for patients with hemophilia A should take place in a center with adequate laboratory support for perioperative assessment of FVIII level including inhibitor screening and optimal blood bank support to provide sufficient quantities of FVIII concentrates.  
  
**Emergency procedures  
**Emergency bleeding incidents (trauma) or emergency surgery require immediate intervention with a major dose of FVIII concentrate infusion to ensure hemostasis.  
**  
Anesthesia, surgical and peri-operative precautions and meticulous care for:  
**IV starts  
Consider 22-gauge cannulation  
Avoid intramuscular injections  
Consider tracheal intubations with a GlideScope to decrease trauma.  
Avoid nasal cannulation  
Avoid NSAIDs  
Gentle oropharyngeal suctioning, consider a red rubber catheter with blunt tip and side port.  
Central line insertions should be done under ultrasound guidance  
Maintenance of BP to avoid access bleeding  
Careful with positioning, utilize padding to for extremities to prevent intramuscular hematomas or hemarthrosis.  
Prevent hypertension and tachycardia as it may increase surgical bleeding.   
Surgeon should give special attention to small vessel hemostasis, rather than trusting on hemostatic physiological mechanisms.  
For prolonged procedures, consider monitoring Hb, PT, aPTT and INR to assess adequate levels of FX as specific FX levels are not easily done at some medical institutions.  
If FVIII concentrate is not readily available, consider transfusing FFP perioperatively as recommended to maintain FX within acceptable limits to achieve hemostasis.  
**  
Regional Anesthesia and hemophilia A  
**Regional or neuraxial anesthesia are best avoided as there is a high risk of hemorrhagic complications, such as epidural hematoma.  
Local anesthetic infiltration with lidocaine is very commonly used for minor procedures such as dental extractions after adequate factor replacement therapy.  
  
**Notes:**  
**A documented example of 17kg emergency procedure of Hemophilia A**  
_“_ _In the absence of an inhibitor, plasma FVIII level increases approximately 2 IU/dl per infused IU/kg body weight.  
As FVIII assay was not available to us in emergency, we started slow IV infusion of 850 units (17 kg × 100 IU/dl × 0.5) of FVIII at 100 units per min considering the severe bleeding from mucosal trauma to achieve desired factor level of 100% as per the hematologist's advice.  
Since the half-life of FVIII is approximately 8–12 h, it must be administered twice daily.”
