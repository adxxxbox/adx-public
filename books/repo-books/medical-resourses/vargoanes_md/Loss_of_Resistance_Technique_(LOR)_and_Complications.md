### Loss of Resistance Technique (LOR) and Complications

Many research articles evaluate the efficacy and safety of both air and saline in the loss of resistance technique for identification of the epidural space. Many results do not differ between air and saline in terms of the LOR for identification of the epidural space and reduction of complications.  
  
**LOR - Air vs Normal Saline  
**Literature today supports utilizing normal saline instead of air with the LOR technique during epidural procedures. The complications of inadvertently injecting air into the subarachnoid space resulting in a Pneumocephalus are well documented. However, these complications are still very rare and most anesthesia providers still prefer to use air over normal saline.  
  
LOR using either an air or saline-filled syringe is widely used to identify the epidural space while performing an epidural. The choice of using air or saline in the loss of resistant syringes for identifying the epidural space is a personal preference among anesthesia providers.  
_**(NOTE:** I was taught to use air – that was the predominant method in the Army at that time. When I got out, I began to use saline. Now, I use saline along with a small amount of air in a “bubble” on the wall of the LOR syringe. The bubble compresses with resistance to injection when the needle is in ligament. I can see the bubble re-expand (‘decompress’) with loss of resistance; usually I see that happen before the plunger moves. (A disclaimer: as with others of my “pearls,” I have never seen this technique documented in the literature and do not now recall where I first read about it.) Jim Carrol, CRNA_  
  
**What is a LOR syringe?**  
A LOR syringe is the specialized syringe that comes in your epidural kit.  
These single use syringes are mostly glass, but some are plastic.  
The LOR syringe is a low-friction syringe with a smooth sliding plunger that provides excellent sensitivity for epidural space detection. These syringes are not to be confused with the more resistant syringes with which we administer meds.  
  
**Volume of air or saline**  
The less the better.  
2-5 mLs of either air or sterile saline is the average.  
  
**LOR Technique** 2-5 mLs of either air or sterile saline is drawn up in a LOR syringe. The syringe is connected via luer lock to the hub of the epidural needle. You do NOT connect the LOR syringe (with air or saline) until you know you are in the ligamentum flavum.  
_(If you connect the LOR syringe before that, you increase the risk of a false LOR and a  
malpositioned catheter that will need replaced).  
  
_Once you feel you are in the ligamentum flavum, you start to apply continuous intermittent pressure to the plunger with your thumb as the epidural needle is advanced in toward the epidural space.  
  
The plunger will NOT budge due to the back resistance while the epidural needle is still in the tough ligamentum flavum.  
  
Once the epidural needle exits the ligamentum flavum and enters the OPEN epidural space, there is an immediate loss of resistance and you can verify this by injecting the air or saline without any resistance at all.  
  
From that point, you advance the epidural catheter 3-5cm and carefully remove the needle.  
  
**A False LOR  
**This term means you had a false loss of resistance from another area other than the epidural space. Meaning that the anesthesia provider probably followed with injecting 2-5 mLs of air or saline into the WRONG space after a loss of resistance.  
Injecting air into the subarachnoid can cause a “ **Pneumocephalus.”  
**  
With a patient in the sitting position, if air is injected into the subarachnoid space from an accidental dural puncture, it will usually migrate up to the brain within the cerebral ventricles resulting in a sudden and often a severe headache (Pneumocephalus).  
  
**Imagine multiple injections of air  
**Injecting air with multiple unsuccessful epidural attempts may result in a Pneumocephalus, peridural air and or subcutaneous emphysema along the vertebrae column.  
  
There are case reports in the literature in which up to 20 ml of air, injected during multiple unsuccessful attempts, resulted in severe complications.  
  
**Possible complications of using air with the LOR Technique  
**Complications associated with the use of air for the loss of resistance technique are:  
Iatrogenic Pneumocephalus  
Spinal cord and nerve root compression  
Retroperitoneal air  
Subcutaneous emphysema  
Venous air embolism  
  
Injected air is associated with inadequate analgesia and paresthesia.  
  
Despite saline preferred over air with the LOR technique, there is still conflicting literature as to the superiority of one over the other.
