### Epidural Dosing of Bupivacaine (Marcaine, Sensorcaine)

  
_Dr. Alyson Eastep, CRNA, Summerton, SC_

Bupivacaine is a long-acting amide local anesthetic  
Provides high quality analgesia with minimal motor blockade  
Has minimal effect on the fetus  
  
Ropivacaine has become more popular than Bupivacaine because Bupivacaine is far more cardiotoxic and has a more profound motor block. Motor block is undesirable when it comes time for pushing, yet many providers use Bupivicaine because it is cheaper.  
  
0.0625, 0.125 and 0.25% are used for epidural analgesia (0.125% is the most common infusion)  
0.5-0.75% concentrations are used for surgical anesthesia – motor block  
0.75% is only used for spinals 0.75% per epidural infusion carries an increased risk of cardiotoxicity.  
  
**Epinephrine and Bupivacaine** : Literature states that epinephrine has little to no effect in increasing the duration of Bupivacaine. Epinephrine is still commonly added to Bupivacaine for spinals.

_Epinephrine is not commonly added to bupivacaine; it is preferable to redose it._  
  
**Bupivacaine concentrations used to initiate epidural analgesia range from 0.0625% to 0.25%.** A popular concentration of Bupivacaine is 0.125%.  
0.125%. = 1.25mg/ml, so 5-10 ml = 6.25-12.5 mg  
8-10 ml of 0.125% of Bupivacaine plus 1-2 ml Fentanyl is commonly used as a loading dose.  
  
**For a vaginal delivery** : the partituent is usually completely comfortable from 2 5ml boluses (10 ml) of 0.125% Bupivacaine (12.5 mg), followed by a PCEA rate of 10 ml/hour to cover a T10 level. There are many possible cocktails; this is just a common one.  
  
**Failed Vaginal delivery to C-section  
**Bupivacaine is not usually used for C-sections per epidural.You need will need a higher level up to T4-6. This is why an increased volume (20 ml) is usually the maximum.  
If the parturient already has a good sensory level from the labor epidural and we commonly administer around **10ml of lidocaine** in 5 ml increments that will usually reach a T4-6 level.  
We usually draw up 20ml just in case.  
  
**For a block starting at < 3cm Cervical Dilation  
**For < 3cm cervical dilation, most anesthesia providers dose the patient the same as above (for vaginal delivery). Some providers will be more aggressive since it is early in labor and a long way away from pushing  
  
**An Initial Bolus Dose with a Narcotic**  
Two 5-6ml doses (10-12 ml total) with 0.125% of Bupivacaine + 10 mcg of Sufentanil OR 50-75 mcg of Fentanyl given in two increments 3-4 min apart.  
  
If pain scores are low, start with 10 ml of bupivacaine.  
If the women is in extreme pain, start with 15 ml.  
You still want to limit motor block early on. However, some women require more. The key is to stay in the room and give more local until the woman is comfortable.  
  
**Continuous infusion  
**0.0625% or 0.125% Bupivacaine + Sufentanil 0.3-0.4 mcg/ml or fentanyl 2 mcg/ml at 12-15 ml/h.  
Higher infusion rates provide much better sacral analgesia.  
  
**Cardiotoxicity  
**Bupivacaine has a high degree of protein binding and lipid solubility. These properties cause it to accumulate in the cardiac conduction system and result in the onset of refractory reentrant arrhythmias and Torsades de Pointes.  
Bupivacaine is four times more potent than lidocaine in blocking nerves and depressing cardiac contractility.  
  
**Plasma Concentrations  
**4 mcg/ml plasma level of Bupivacaine will result in seizures **_._** 4-6 mcg/ml is associated with cardiotoxicity.Lidocaine is 20-25 mcg/ml for cardiotoxicity. Bupivacaine (as well as etidocaine) is more likely to impair the myocardium and conduction system with toxic doses than other local anesthetics  
  
**Molecular Relationship to Mepivacaine  
**Bupivacaine is a congener of mepivacaine, with 3 methyl groups added to the piperidine ring of the mepivacaine molecule.
