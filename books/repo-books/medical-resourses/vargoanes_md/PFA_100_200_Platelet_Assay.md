Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA) - 100/200    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA) - 100/200

_Used when history of antiplatelet therapy is unknown.  
A nonspecific test for platelet function_  
  
This analyzer uses small membranes coated with either collagen and epinephrine (Col/Epi) or collagen and ADP (Col/ADP).  
Anticoagulated whole blood is inserted and passes through the membranes at a high shear rate to simulate the in vivo hemodynamics in the small capillaries.  
Platelets adhere to the membranes and gradually occlude a small aperture in the center of each membrane.**  
  
Closing Time**  
The time, in seconds, for blood to completely occlude the aperture is referred to as the Closure Time (CT). The CT is a possible alternative or supplement to the bleeding time.  
  
**The cartridge membranes are coated with:**  
Collagen and either epinephrine (COL/EPI) or  
Adenosine diphosphate (COL/ADP) or  
Prostaglandin E1 and Ca-supposed to be more sensitive to P2Y12 inhibitors.  
  
**Initially, only a COL/EPI membrane is used.  
**The PFA test is initially performed with the Col/Epi membrane.  
A normal Col/Epi closure time (<180 seconds) excludes the presence of a significant platelet function defect. A COL/ADP test will NOT be performed.  
  
If the Col/Epi closure time is prolonged (>180 seconds), the Col/ADP test is automatically performed.  
  
**The test cartridges are cheap**  
The cost of each test using a C/Epi or C/ADP test cartridge is around $12.

_Literature varies with normal values_

**Results can be affects by:  
**vWF  
Low platelets (<100k)  
Hematocrit (<30%)  
use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors**  
  
More Notes  
**Insensitive to Plavix (P2Y12) effect but can screen for suspected ASA use.  
Effective to monitor DDAVP
