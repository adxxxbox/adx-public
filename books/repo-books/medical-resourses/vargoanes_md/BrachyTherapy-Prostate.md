### BrachyTherapy and/or HDR for Prostate CA

**HDR- High Dose Rate**  
**LDR- Low Dose Rate**  
**There are two types of brachytherapy:**  
Permanent Low Dose Seed Implants (LDR)  
Temporary High Dose Implants (HDR)

**Men:** For prostate cancer  
**Women:** For gynecologic cancers

BrachyTherapy for prostate cancer is more frequently employed than for gynecologic cancers.  
Anesthesia is the same regardless of the gender.  
General anesthesia with an LMA or an ETT is the most prevalent  
An SAB is another option.  

**Anesthetic:** Your plan depends on if it is an HDR or LDR and what the surgeon prefers (if it’s of coarse safe for the patient). The surgeons demand no movement either way.

**For HDR:** a spinal with sedation or intubation with complete relaxation is commonly requested by the doctor. The patient will later be transported to radiation oncology. If the patient has a spinal and is wide-awake at the end of the procedure, sometimes the recovery room may be bypassed, and go straight to radiation oncology for the HDR brachytherapy. You will transfer your care to the oncology RN. This is only when the surgeon demands it. However, most other hospitals wait for the patient to wake up in the recovery room before transporting the patient to radiation oncology.

**For LDR:** Usually intubation with relaxation, sometimes a spinal. The patient does not go down to radiation oncology after the procedure because the LDR seeds are inserted during the procedure in the operating room

With LDR, the room should be scanned with a Geiger counter after surgery before the room is set up for the next case.

**Duration:** 2 hours  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 22-20G is acceptable  
**Position:** Lithotomy with arms out.

**Possible Complications**  
Bleeding  
Seeds later becoming dislodged and moving somewhere else in the body.

**More Notes and Facts**

**HDR Brachytherapy**  
HDR Brachytherapy only temporarily exposes abnormal tissue tumor to a high amount of radiation. While in the operating room, around 20 metal tubes or plastic catheters are inserted through the perineum and into the prostate. An ultrasound probe is inserted into the rectum to visualize the prostate and to make sure the probes are placed in the proper positions and a Foley catheter is also placed to visualize the bladder and drain urine. The patient is then transported to radiation oncology to get a CT scan to verify the catheter placement and generate the treatment plan. The patient receives the HDR in radiation oncology and NOT while in the operating room. The patient does not go home with HDR seeds in place.

While the patient is in a CT scan and using fluoroscopic guidance, a long flexible catheter(s) is passed down through the applicators (larger catheters) that leads to the tumor. The tip should be imbedded within the targeted tissue. Sometimes these catheters are long hollow needles that basically look like skinny rods. The potent radiation pellets are then administered.

**HDR** consists of 2 Phases (procedures), both about 7 days apart. The anesthesia is the same for both. Sometimes the doctors combine them to one procedure. Remember for HDR, only the metal applicators are inserted in the operating room. This procedure entails 2 doctors, a radiation oncologist and urologist. A capped Foley catheter is inserted for a landmark to visualize the urethra via ultrasound. About 15-20 long metal catheter-like needles are inserted through the perineum above the rectum and guided to the prostate with a visual from the ultra sound. When the catheters are in place, we wake the patient up and go to the recovery room. After the patient is awake enough, he will then be transported to Radiation Oncology for the insertion of the radioactive pellets. For HDR, the radiation pellets (seeds) are too strong to be present in the operating room.

**Candidates for HDR:** Early stage Prostate Cancer as an alternative to Prostatectomy or later stage where surgery is not a preferred option.

**Concerns:** Be careful when sliding the patient back on the stretcher. The patient may have these long newly inserted skinny rods sticking out, so avoid displacement. The patient’s legs need to remain abducted.

**Brachytherapy LDR (without HDR) of the Prostate:**  
Consists of 2 Phases (procedures), both about 7 days apart. The anesthesia is the same for both. Sometimes the doctors combine them to one procedure.

For LDR, the patient is still taken to the operating room and put to sleep. A rectal ultrasound is also used to visualize the prostate. Instead of temporary catheters being placed into the prostate, permanent seeds containing radioactive sources are inserted using needles that are removed after the seeds are inserted. The seeds, made of Iodine or Palladium, are permanent implants and cannot be removed once in place. The seed positions are determined either preoperatively or during the procedure itself. The retained seeds slowly emit radiation to the surrounding tissue, over several months, killing the cancer. The patient may stay in the hospital for a day or two to make sure there are no acute side effects.

The major difference between HDR and LDR is that with LDR, the patient will still be radioactive after the procedure because the LDR seeds (pellets) remain in place. This radioactivity slowly decreases over time (radioactive decay). Although the level of radiation is relatively low, it is recommended that small children avoid sitting on laps of patients and pregnant women stand at least 5 feet away from the patient for at least six months after the treatment.

**For Brachytherapy LDR**  
80-100 radioactive seeds will be inserted 4-5 at a time. The seeds should stay in forever. These will basically ablate the prostate. Brachytherapy has an 87-93% success rate, which is equivalent to the prostatectomy.

**Radioactive Pellets:** Narrow and tubular, because these pellets must be able to travel through the catheters. They are about the size of a grain of rice. With HDR, the radiation can also go just outside the prostate as targeted.
