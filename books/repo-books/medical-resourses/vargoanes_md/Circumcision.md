Circumcision (Adults)     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Circumcision (Adults)

Is the surgical removal of all or part of the foreskin of the glans penis in males.  

**Two common techniques:**  
The dorsal slit  
The sleeve technique

The dorsal slit is especially useful in patients who have phimosis.

The sleeve technique may provide better control of bleeding in patients with large subcutaneous veins.

**Anesthetic:** Usually General/LMA  
**Regional:** A dorsal penile nerve block, with or without a circumferential penile block, provides adequate anesthesia. I know this goes without saying, but make sure your circulator and the scrub tech never use Epinephrine in the penile block local anesthetics they draw up for the surgeon. I have seen one case where this way inadvertently done and it was a nightmare.  
Regionals are very rare for this procedure; although a SAB is perfectly fine for this procedure.  
**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**EBL**: Minimal  
**Indications:**  
**Phimosis:** When the foreskin is constricted and cannot be pulled back over the head of the penis (glans). 

**Recurrent Balanoposthitis:**  
Balanoposthitis is a recurrent type of infection known as balanitis. It causes inflammation of the glans of the penis. 

**Paraphimosis:**  
A rare condition in which the foreskin gets stuck in its retracted position: that is, after the foreskin is pulled back over the glans of the penis, it cannot be replaced to its usual position. It causes painful constriction of the glans.

**Posthitis:** Inflammation of the prepuce or foreskin.

**Complications:**   
Infection  
Bleeding  
Poor cosmetic results.  
Change in sensation during intercourse.

**Procedure:**  
The glans and foreskin are separated to fully expose the coronal groove. A ventral surface cut is made in the foreskin on the upper side of the penis using scissors. A second slit is made on the underside of the penis. The foreskin is cut away around the rim of the coronal groove. The edges of the foreskin are pulled back. Blood vessels are tied off using absorbable stitches or by cautery. The edges of the foreskin are then stitched together and the dressing is applied. Usually Xeroform gauze is placed over the wound.  
  
**More Notes:**  
Circumcisions are usually performed on newborn boys or at puberty. In many African cultures, circumcision is performed to indicate adulthood and readiness for sexual activity.  
Those of the Jewish faith celebrate the birth of the male child on the 8th day of birth by having a **_bris_**. It is a 10-15 minute procedure performed in a synagogue, at home, or another event space. A **_mohel_**, or ritual circumciser, will perform the circumcision, which takes less than 2 minutes. This is a religious ceremony for those of the Jewish faith and yet it is not somber. It is part sacred ritual and part celebration. At the time of this event, the newborn is also given his Hebrew name by the mohel.
