### CSF (Cerebral Spinal Fluid) Facts

CSF is a clear colorless bodily fluid found in the brain and spine.  
It occupies the subarachnoid space (the space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater) and the ventricular system around and inside the brain and spinal cord.  
  
**Formation of CSF** Most of the CSF (80%) is produced from arterial blood by the choroid plexuses of the lateral 3rd and fourth ventricle.  
The rest is produced from the ependymal cells lining the ventricles.  
  
The CSF production rate is 0.2-0.7 mL/min, or 600-700mL/day.  
CSF volume at any given time is 140-270mLs (literature varies).  
The volume of the ventricles is about 25 ml.  
  
**The circulation of CSF:**  
Is aided by the pulsations of the choroid plexus and by the motion of the cilia of ependymal cellsLateral Venticles

CSF is turned over every 5-7 hours (4 times a day).  
  
**CSF Reabsorption  
**Reabsorption depends on the pressure gradient between the CSF pressure and the venous circulation.  
  
When the CSF pressure exceeds venous sinus pressure, the  
CSF seeps through channels in arachnoid villi into venous sinuses.  
Much of that drains into lymphatic vessels around the cranial cavity and spinal canal. So, the greater the CSF pressure, the greater the reabsorption.  
However, when the venous sinus pressure exceeds CSF pressure, the tips of the arachnoid villi are compressed so that the channels are closed preventing reflux of blood into CSF.  
  
The arachnoid villi act as one-way valves between the subarachnoid space and the dural sinuses.  
  
CSF acts as a cushion that protects the brain from shocks and supports the venous sinuses.  
It also plays an important role in the homeostasis and metabolism of the central nervous system.  
  
**Normal Composition of CSF  
Gross appearance:** normal CSF, clear and colorless  
**specific gravity** : 1.006–1.009  
**glucose:** 40–80 mg/dL  
**Osmolarity:** 295 mOsm/L  
**Na:** 138 mEq/L  
**K+:** 2.8 mEq/L  
**Ca:** 2.1 mEq/L  
**Mg:** 0.3 mEq/L  
**Cl:** 119 mEq/L  
**pH:** 7.33  
**total protein:** 15–45 mg/dL  
**LD:** 1/10 of serum level  
**Lactate:** less than 35 mg/dL  
**Leukocytes** : 0–6/microL (adults and children); up to 19/microL in infants; up to 30/microL (newborns)  
**Differential:** 60–80 percent lymphocytes; up to 30 percent monocytes and  
**Macrophages:** other cells 2 % or less.  
Monocytes and macrophages are somewhat higher in neonates, and make up as much as 80 percent or more, with only 20 percent or less being lymphocytes.  
**Gram stain:** negative  
**Culture:** sterile  
**Syphilis serology:** negative  
**Red blood cell count:** normally, none unless the needle passes though a blood vessel on route to the CSF.  
  
The CSF opening pressure in age greater than 8 years via lumbar puncture is 100-180 mmH2O or 8-15mmHg with the patient lying on the side.  
Sitting up pressure: 200-300mmH2O CSF opening pressure in infants and younger children is 10–100mm H 2 O.  
  
**Functions of CSF  
**Supports the brain - the weight of the brain is suspended in cerebral spinal fluid.  
Protects the brain from trauma - by providing a cushioning space around tissue.  
Cleanses the brain - rinses metabolic waste through the blood.  
Buoyancy of CSF reduces the concussion damage to the brain when the cranium moves suddenly.  
Nourishes the brain.  
Removes metabolites from CNS.  
Carries pineal secretions to pituitary gland.  
CSF secretion.  
  
A CSF from a lumbar puncture is currently used in the diagnosis of MS. If there are specific markers in the fluid, called oligoclonal banding, it is a sign that myelin is being degraded in the central nervous system.  
  
CSF is self-regulating, and volume lessens when there is a problem with perfusion.  
  
**When CSF levels increase, perfusion (cerebral blood flow) of the brain decreases.** **More Notes  
**There are four ventricles of the brain.  
Each of two lateral ventricles (ventricles 1 and 2) occupies a cerebral hemisphere.  
  
**The third ventricle** is connected by the interventricular foramen to each of the two lateral ventricles.  
  
**The fourth ventricle** connects to the third ventricle by the cerebral aqueduct and to the central canal of the spinal cord. Additional openings in the fourth ventricle allow CSF to flow into the subarachnoid space.  
  
The **choroid plexus** (a network of capillaries) projects into each ventricle. They can be visualized during an endoscopic ventriculostomy.  
**Ependymal cells** (a type of neuroglial cell) surround the choroid plexus.  
  
Blood plasma entering the ependymal cells from the capillaries is filtered as it passes into the ventricle, forming CSF. Any material passing from the capillaries to the ventricles of the brain must do so through the ependymal cells because tight junctions linking these cells prevent the passage of plasma between them. Thus, the ependymal cells maintain a blood‐CSF barrier, controlling the composition of the CSF.  
  
The CSF circulates from the lateral ventricles (where most of the CSF is produced) to the third and then fourth ventricles. From the fourth ventricle, most of the CSF passes into the subarachnoid space, although some CSF also passes into the central canal of the spinal cord. The CSF returns to the blood through the arachnoid villi located in the dural sinuses of the meninges.
