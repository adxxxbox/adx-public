### Postdural Puncture Headache (PDPH) Conservative Treatment Regimens

For the treatment of PDPH, conservative regimens vary among experienced anesthesia providers.  
**Below are some regimens for PDPH:**  
  
**Anesthesia provider (A):**  
**Hydration** (1 liter of normal saline of LR IV)  
**Toradol**  
**Fioricet:** One or two tablets every 4 hours as needed. The total daily dosage should be at most six tablets.  
**Cosyntropin** (Cortrosyn) **:** 500 mcg in 1 liter of normal saline (with hydration)  
If the epidural catheter is still in, do not remove it.  
  
**Anesthesia provider (B):**  
If it was from a known dural puncture, I leave the catheter intrathecal for 24 hours.  
Then I push fluids and caffeine.  
If it is not a known wet tap and they develop a headache consistent with PDPH, I will administer 20 mcg/kg neostigmine and 10 mcg/kg of atropine in a 100 mL bag over one hour.  
Then I order Fioricet 1 to 2 pills Q 4 hours and not to exceed the daily recommended dose of acetaminophen.  
After 24 hours, if the patient still has a debilitating headache, I perform an epidural blood patch.  
  
**Anesthesia provider (C):**  
Bedrest has not been proven to help; it is up to the patient.**Hydration** IV or lots of PO caffeine and fluid  
Toradol or another NSAID  
  
**Fioricet:** One or two tablets every 4 hours as needed.  
500 mcg of Cosyntropin (Cortrosyn) in 1 liter of normal saline  
I may repeat Cosyntropin the next day.  
I like to infuse it at night while the patient is sleeping.  
Leave the epidural catheter in 24 more hours.  
  
**Anesthesia provider (D):  
**I go straight to a blood patch because most conservative treatments do not work; they only decrease the symptoms.  
Cosyntropin is excellent at relieving the symptoms temporarily, then the headache returns, and they get a blood patch.  
  
**Anesthesia provider (E):  
**2 mg of neostigmine and 0.2 mg of glycopyrrolate  
Abdominal binderI perform an epidural blood patch if the severe headache continues.**  
  
Anesthesia provider (F):  
**Where I will practice, I go straight to the blood patch.  
In my experience, conservative treatments are ineffective in a severe headache from a wet tap.
