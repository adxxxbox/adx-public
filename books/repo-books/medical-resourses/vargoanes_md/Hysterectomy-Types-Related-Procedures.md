### Hysterectomy Types and Related Procedures

**Robotic Hysterectomy (da Vinci)**: Is becoming more popular. Offers a faster recovery.

**Total Abdominal Hysterectomy (TAH):** A large abdominal incision to remove the uterus and cervix. The surgeon detaches the uterus from the ovaries, fallopian tubes and upper vagina, as well as from the blood vessels and connective tissues that support it. The patient usually keeps her ovaries.  
  
**Partial or sub-total Abdominal hysterectomy:** Removes just the uterus and leaves the cervix intact.

**Sometimes the surgeon will also remove ovaries and fallopian tubes:**  

**Salpingo-oophorectomy**: Remove a fallopian tube and the ovary at the same time.

**Partial oophorectomy-** Removal or resection of parts of the ovary.  
**Salpingectomy:** Removal of a Fallopian tube.

**Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy (BSO):** Removal of bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries.

**Radical Hysterectomy**: Complete removal of the uterus, cervix, upper vagina, and parametrium. Lymph nodes, ovaries and fallopian tubes are also usually removed.

**Total Abdominal Hysterectomy with Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy (TAH w/ BSO);**  
Besides removing the uterus and cervix, both Fallopian tubes and ovaries are also removed. Lymph node dissections may be done concomitantly.

**Vaginal hysterectomy**: Removing the uterus and cervix through the vagina. Repair consists of closure of the vaginal cuff. This is usually the surgery of choice if there is a prolapse or if there is no possibility of cancer. The patient must have a small to normal uterus.

**Laparoscopically Assisted Vaginal Hysterectomy (LAVH):**  
When the surgeon uses a laparoscope to guide the removal of the uterus and/or Fallopian tubes and ovaries through the vagina.

**Hand-Assisted Laparoscopic Hysterectomy:** The surgeon uses a smaller glove-size abdominal incision while preserving the pneumoperitoneum.

**Complications:**  
Postoperative hemorrhage is one of the most serious complications.
