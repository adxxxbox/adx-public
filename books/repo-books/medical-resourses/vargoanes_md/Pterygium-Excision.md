Pterygium - Excision     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Pterygium - Excision

A pterygium (pterygia) is fleshy tissue that grows in a triangular shape over the cornea. It may grow large enough to interfere with vision. An excision followed by a conjunctival autograft or allograft is the usual treatment.  
**Anesthetic:** MAC with a Retrobulbar Block.  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 22G is acceptable. A 500mL NS bag with micro drip tubing is popular.  
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes.  
**Position:** Supine with arms tucked and the patient remains on the same stretcher. Make sure the ETCO2 NC is looped away from the surgical eye. The stretcher is parked 90-180 degrees away from you (unless you are starting out as a general).
