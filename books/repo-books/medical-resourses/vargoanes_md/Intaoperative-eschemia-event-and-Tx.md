### Possible Intaoperative Ischemia Events and Treatment

About 40% of patients undertoing CABG surgery have intraoperative episodes of myocardial ischemia. Always us a 5 lead ECG.  
  
**If increased BP (SVR) and increased PCWP**  
The increased SVR increases the work of heart and 02 consumption is also increased due to increased afterload.  
  
**How to Decrease SVR**  
Increase anesthetic depth ( isoflurane).  
Start or increase infusion rate of nitroglycerine (NTG).  
Stop or decrease the infusion rat of phenylephrine.  
  
**If HR is increased:** Tachycardia will increase MVO2 and decrease coronary arterial blood flow Administer a beta-blocker such as esmolol or metoprolol. These are Beta-1 specific.  
  
**If blood pressure is decreased with decreased SVR and decreased or normal PCWP**  
BP is decreased because the SVR is decreased. This can decrease coronary artery perfusion pressure, which decreases coronary blood flow. SVR must be increased.  
  
**How to Increase SVR**  
Decrease anesthetic depth.  
Start or increase infusion rate of phenylephrine.  
Stop or decrease infusion rate of your nitroglycerine (NTG) drip  
  
**If blood pressure is decreased and PCWP is elevated:**  
This indicates LV failure.  
Administer a positive inotrope and a small dose of phenylephrine to increase SVR.
