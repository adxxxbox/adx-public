### The 2 Internal Mammary Arteries (IMAs) a.k.a. Internal Thoracic Arteries (ITAs)

The LIMA (left internal mammary artery) usually originates from the first portion of the left subclavian artery. The RIMA (right internal mammary artery) usually originates from the right subclavian artery. They both descend lateral to the sternum to the level of the sixth rib. From there they divide into the superior epigastric and musculophrenic arteries. These two arteries supply the anterior chest wall from the level of clavicle to the umbilicus.  
  
Fewer than 4% of IMAs develop atherosclerosis, and only 1% have atherosclerotic stenoses of hemodynamic significance. For some unknown reason, the internal mammary arteries are highly resistant to the development of atherosclerosis in contrast to native coronary vessels and vein grafts. The IMAs appear to remain patent indefinitely. This is why studies show that the IMAs are superior to the saphenous vein grafts (SVGs).  
  
The disadvantage of using the IMA is that it may spasm and eventually atrophy if used to bypass a coronary artery without a flow-limiting stenosis. Studies show an improved survival rate in patients undergoing a CABG when the LIMA (rather than an SVG) is used to graft the LAD artery; this survival benefit is independent of the patient's sex, age, extent of CAD, and LV systolic function. Apart from improving survival rate, LIMA grafting of the LAD artery reduces the incidence of late MI, hospitalization for cardiac events, need for reoperation, and recurrence of angina. The LIMA should be used to bypass the LAD artery provided that a contraindication to its use ( e.g., emergency surgery, poor LIMA blood flow, subclavian artery stenosis, radiation injury, atherosclerosis) is not present.  
  
As compared to the saphenous veins the IMAs are smaller and more delicate. Sometimes the LIMA is too small to use. In other cases, the vessel is so delicate that the mere procedure of removing it from underneath the ribs will cause harm to the vessel wall, making the IMA useless. The grafted vessel is so sensitive that certain vessel clamps can cause intimal injury.  
  
However, in about 90% of coronary bypass operations, this vessel is the best conduit available for surgical bypass to the major arteries of the heart.
