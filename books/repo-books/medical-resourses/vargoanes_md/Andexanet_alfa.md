### Andexanet alfa (andexanet)

_Currently its manufacturer is pursuing FDA approval and it is in phase 4._  
  
Andexanet alfa has been designed and developed specifically to reverse the effects of both direct and indirect factor Xa inhibitors. It is a recombinant, modified human factor Xa decoy protein that binds factor Xa inhibitors but does not have intrinsic catalytic activity.  
  
**Method of Action**  
Andexanet alfa acts as a decoy to target and sequester with high specificity of these anticoagulants.  
  
In healthy older volunteers who were receiving either apixaban or rivaroxaban, a bolus and infusion of andexanet sharply reduced both the unbound fraction of the plasma level of factor Xa inhibitor and anti–factor Xa activity, with minimal serious adverse effects.  
  
**Targeted for the following anticoagulants after FDA approval.  
**Apaxiban  
Edoxaban  
Rivaroxaban  
Enoxaparin  
Fondaparinux
