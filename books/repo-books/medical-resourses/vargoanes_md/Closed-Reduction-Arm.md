Closed Reduction of a Humerus, Radius or Ulna Fracture     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Closed Reduction of a Humerus, Radius or Ulna Fracture

  
Closed reduction is a procedure to set or reduce a broken bone without surgery. The physician manipulates or aligns the fractured bones from the outside of the body to correctly position the broken bones to grow back together. Success rate is best when the reduction is done as soon as possible.  The reduction is usually confirmed with a C-arm.  
These are quick cases. Creating the splint or cast usually takes longer than the procedure.

 **Anesthetic:** General/ETT or LMA

Sometimes just a deep MAC, but that is rare. I have even seen a low dose of Anectine given with an LMA when brief relaxation is demanded.

Check with the surgeon. Some surgeons will demand relaxation. Many of these patients have NOT been NPO for 8 hours requiring RSI/ETT. If the patient has been NPO, the most common method is usually an LMA.

**Duration:** 5-30 minutes  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
**Position:** Supine  
**EBL:** none

  
Literature states that an Interscalene, Supraclavicular or Infraclavicular block is optional. This is very rare.

**Possible Complications**  
Nerve damage.  
Pulmonary embolus.  
Need for additional surgery if the bone does not heal properly.  
Reaction to anesthesia.
