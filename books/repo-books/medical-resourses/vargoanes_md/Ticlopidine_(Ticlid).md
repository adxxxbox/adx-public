Ticlopidine (Ticlid)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Ticlopidine (Ticlid)

Irreversible platelet aggregation inhibitor (like Clopidogrel).  
Member of the thienopyridine family which is an adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor inhibitor.  
  
Administered PO  
  
**Indications  
**Reduce the risk of thrombotic stroke (fatal or nonfatal) in patients who have experienced stroke precursors, and in patients who have had a completed thrombotic stroke.  
  
**Rare side effects limit the use of Ticlid**  
Unfortunately, Ticlid is associated with life-threatening blood dyscrasias including:  
Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)  
Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis  
Aplastic Anemia.  
  
Ticlid is commonly reserved for patients who are intolerant or allergic to aspirin therapy or who have failed aspirin therapy.  
  
Also used as adjunctive therapy with aspirin to reduce the incidence of subacute stent thrombosis in patients undergoing successful coronary stent.  
  
**Mechanism of Action**  
Irreversibly interferes with platelet membrane function by inhibiting ADP-induced platelet-fibrinogen binding and subsequent platelet-platelet interactions.  
  
**Peak plasma levels:** occur in 2 hours  
  
**Duration:**  
The effect on platelet function is irreversible for the life of the platelet.  
After discontinuation, bleeding time and other platelet function tests return to normal within 2 weeks, in the majority of patients.  
  
**Metabolism:** Extensively by the liver; only trace amounts of intact drug are detected in the urine.  
  
**Elimination half-life:** 24-36 hours (literature varies)  
  
**Metabolites:** At least 20 and not active.  
Antiplatelet effect lasts 5‐7 days after stopping therapy.  
**Antidote:** None, platelet infusion  
  
**Ticlopidine (Ticlid) and Neuraxial or Deep Regional Block**
