### Thoracotomy -Wedge Resection-Lung

It is also known as a segmentectomy.

**OLV:** One Lung Ventilation

**Procedure:**

-   The surgeon removes a wedge-shaped piece of lung tissue.
-   This is performed instead of a lobectomy when there is a danger of decreased lung function if too much of the lung is removed.
-   A wedge resection preserves as much healthy lung tissue as possible.

**Surgical indications:**

Remove of diseased tissue

To remove early-stage lung cancer or a nodule

**Anesthesia thoracoscopy synopsis and room setup:**

-   One lung ventilation (OLV)
-   Left double lumen tube (DLT) with lung collapse (usually 39Fr for males and 37Fr for Females)
-   Bronchoscopy to verify proper DLT position
-   Kelly Clamp
-   Lateral position
-   ESP block
-   2 IVs
-   A-line -usually
-   Communicate with the thoracic surgeon concerning regional anesthesia preoperatively

**Anesthesia Management:**

**Type and Crossed:** Yes, with two units of pack cells available prior to surgery.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT (Left DLT) or bronchial blocker

**Duration:** 1-2 hours

**EBL:** 25-100 mLs

**DLT:**

**Adult males:** 39-41Fr

**Adult female:** 35-37Fr

Fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB): A bronchoscope must be prepared in the room before induction.

-   The anesthesiologist or surgeon performs an FOB to verify the left DLT placement.
-   Make sure you securely tape the DLT because it may move out of the proper position when moving the patient's head while going into the lateral position.
-   An unsuccessful lung deflation will indicate that the DLT has moved due to positioning.

**Intubation with DLT:**

-   Be careful not to use excessive force during DLT insertion, or it may result in catastrophic airway damage.
-   Do not overinflate the bronchial balloon or main cuff.
-   Only use a 3 mL syringe to inflate the smaller bronchial balloon, as you do not want to overinflate it (only requires < 3 mL of air).

**Large Hemostat or Kelly Clamp:** Have one available for clamping the DLT to deflate the appropriate lung.

**Regional anesthesia:**

Erector spinae plane (ESP) or Paravertebral block

**Note:** Some thoracic surgeons prefer to perform a block prior to closing.

**Thoracic Epidural:** Being replaced by the ESP block.

If the patient has a thoracic epidural, bolus it before incision.

It helps limit intra-op and post-op pain.

**IV Access:** 2 large bore, usually 18G

**A-line:** Usually

**Labs:** ABG and a CBC from the A-line preoperatively, depending on the procedure's duration and estimated blood loss (EBL).

**Foley Catheter:** Usually

**Neosynephrine Drip:** Have available

**Norepinephrine:** Have available

**Ephedrine:** Have available

**Position:** Lateral decubitus with operative side (independent) lung up.

-   An Axillary roll is needed, and the bed will be flexed with the head and feet both downward.
-   Elevate the head to a neutral position.
-   Extra pillows or folded blankets between the abducted arms.
-   Avoid hyperextending the arms.

**Pressure points to check:** Eyes, ears, and genitals

-   There are usually four people simultaneously positioning the patient.
-   The surgeon will confirm placement prior to draping.
-   Ensure that nothing is pressing against the DLT, and you have easy access for clamping it.
-   Untangle the IV lines to

**For ERAS:** Maintain normothermia and normovolemia

**PONV protocol:** Dexamethasone and Ondansetron

**Fluid warmer and warming blanket:** Yes, sometimes two warming blankets.

These procedures are very prone to hypothermia, especially if it is an open chest.

**Note:** Hypothermia may inhibit hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.

**Refer to** _“One Lung Ventilation (OLV) with VATS and Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction (HPV)”_ in this app for details.

**Ventilation:** Higher peak pressures (PIP) occur with OLV.

**Use:** Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV)

-   When the lung is down, you may need to change your ventilator setting so you don't immediately over inflate and damage the inflated lung.

**Peak pressure (PIP):** < 35 cmH2O

**Plateau pressure:** < 25 cmH2

**PEEP:** 3-8 cm H2O unless there is a bronchopleural fistula present

**Optimal tidal volume with one lung ventilation:** 4-6 mL/kg

**Note:** Normal tidal volume for two healthy lungs: 6-8 mL/kg

_Inadequate ventilator parameters above can result in atelectasis formation_

**FIO2:** 0.6-1.0

**ETCO2:** Normocapnia, titrate with minute ventilation

**Hypercarbia:** Mild hypercarbia is well tolerated, except in patients with pulmonary hypertension.

**Note:** A CO2 > 70 mmHg may be associated with tachycardia, dysthymias, and cardiac depression.

**Inhalation agent:** Isoflurane, desflurane, or sevoflurane if acceptable.

Avoid N2O

If the dependent lung is healthy (with proper DLT placement), the patient should not experience desaturations.

**Resolving desaturations with OLV:**

-   Suctioning of secretions and lung recruitment maneuvers to the dependent (ventilated) lung is often all that is required.
-   First, attempt to manually ventilate the dependent lung by applying more PIP with some inspiratory holds (pulmonary recruitment) by squeezing your bellows bag and maintaining a safe peak pressure for 2-5 second intervals.
-   Shoot for 30-40 cm H2O pressure.
    
-   If unsuccessful, increase the FIO2 if it is not contraindicated.
    
-   Consider suctioning the patient with the extra-long suction catheters that were packaged with the DLT.
-   If unsuccessful, inform the surgeon, and they will permit you to reinflate the independent (collapsed) lung and ventilate both lungs.
-   Once the SaO2 returns to the desired baseline, you can re-collapse the independent lung and resume OLV.
    
-   This may be repeated—possibly several times.

**Reinflating the lung:**

-   When the case is complete, the surgeon will ask you to gradually reinflate the collapsed lung to 20-30 cmH2O.
    
-   This will reinflate the atelectatic areas and check for significant air leaks.
-   Resume normal ventilation for two lungs.

**Chest Tube insertion:**

-   At the end of the case, a chest tube(s) will be inserted to drain the pleural cavity and aid the lung re-expansion.
-   The surgeon may want to know how much tidal volume the patient is losing.
-   If your tidal volume is set to 700 mLs and you are only getting back 400 mLs, you are losing 300 mLs.
-   This should improve when the chest tube(s) is connected to suction.

**Emergence:**

-   Remember to deflate both cuffs just prior to extubating.
-   Perform an AWAKE extubation with the head of the bed up in high fowler's position if possible.
-   Many times, we slide the patient onto their stretcher and extubate them there.
-   The stretcher seems to make it easier to extubate in high fowler's position.

**Possible complications**

Injuries to lateral position

Hemorrhage

Vocal Cord Damage from the DLT insertion

Infection

Structural injuries to thoracotomy

Thoracic duct disruption

Bronchopleural fistula

Tension pneumothorax

Acute lung injury/ARDS

Cardiac herniation

Torsion of the residual lobe

RV failure and pulmonary edema from over-hydration may occur with resected patients.

**Note:** Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is increased in proportion to the amount of lung tissue removed.

An overhydrated patient is at risk for RV failure and pulmonary edema.
