### Rivaroxaban (Xarelto)

Oral Selective Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor.  
Also known as a reversible oral activated factor Xa inhibitor.  
**Note:** Generic names for these agents include **"Xa-ban"(e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban).**  
**Factor Xa:** It holds a central position that links the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways to the final common coagulation pathway. Factor Xa converts the prothrombin zymogen to its active form, thrombin.  
  
**Indications:  
**Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation  
Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)  
Treatment of Pulmonary Embolism  
Reduction in the risk of recurrence of deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism  
  
**Antidote for life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding:** Andexxa (Andexanet alfa)  
  
**Mechanism of Action:**  
XARELTO is a selective inhibitor of FXa.  
Does not require a cofactor (such as Anti-thrombin III) for activity.  
Inhibits free FXa and prothrombinase activity.  
It has no direct effect on platelet aggregation but indirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin.  
By inhibiting FXa, Xarelto decreases thrombin generation.  
  
**Lab Monitoring:** Rivaroxaban and other Factor Xa inhibitors are reliable and do not need routine monitoring, unlike Warfarin and Heparin.  
According to literature, specific lab tests exist for each Factor Xa inhibitor.  
Many laboratories have set up anti-Xa activity assays to monitor the heparin effect and, therefore, have the infrastructure to provide this test.

**Dosing:** Daily  
Supplied in 10mg,15mg and 20mg tablets  
  
**Maximum 10ax inhibitory effect occurs:** 1 to 4 hours (rapidly absorbed)  
**Inhibition  Maintained:** 12 h  
  
**Plasma T1/2:** 7–11 hours (literature varies)  
**Excretion:** 33% Renal and 66% liver  
**Metabolized:** 66% metabolized by the liver, inactive metabolites excreted in urine & stool.  
The terminal elimination half-life of rivaroxaban is 5 to 9 hours in healthy subjects aged 20 to 45.  
  
Rivaroxaban has been compared with LMWH because it demonstrates similar efficacy and bleeding rates.
