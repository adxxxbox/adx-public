### ALIF: Anterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion

The ALIF is similar to the Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion or PLIF, except that in the ALIF procedure, the disc space is fused by approaching the spine through the abdomen instead of from the back or posterior approach. A general surgeon is usually present to gain access through the abdomen for the neuro or orthopedic surgeon.  
Depending on the number of spinal levels to be fused, a 3-8 centimeter transverse or oblique incision is made just to the left of the umbilicus. The abdominal muscles are gently spread apart, but are not cut.

The peritoneal sac (containing the intestines) is moved to the side, as are the large blood vessels. Special retractors are used to allow the surgeon to visualize the anterior aspect of the intervertebral discs. After the retractors are in place, a C-arm is used to confirm that the appropriate spinal level is identified. The rest of the procedure is standard.

**Pre-op:**  
Assess what limbs are being affected for weakness or pain. Is there motor dropout?

**Anesthesia:** General/ETT  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Yes  
**Position:**  Supine, or Lateral. Depends on the lumbar level; usually arms are out. 

**Blood loss:** 50-100 mLs. Sometimes large hemorrhages occur from perforating a large blood vessel.  
**Duration:** 2-4 hours; depending on how many levels are being repaired.

**IV Access:** 2 18g IVs in case of a large hemorrhage-still rare.  

**Antibiotics:** Usually Ancef, unless contraindicated.

The C-arm is used, so you will need a lead apron.

**Possible Complications:**  
Hemorrhage  
L5-S1 in Males: retrograde ejaculation as a result of mechanical or inflammatory damage to the superior hypogastic plexus near the aortic bifurcation.  
Ileus  
Neurological Myelopathy  
Lymphocele due to a chyloretroperitoneum: Injury to lymph channels can cause a chylous fluid collection in the retroperitoneum, leading to pain and bowel ischemia.  
Incisional hernia (this may require corrective surgery).  
DVD  
PE  
Slipped bone graft  
Instrument failure

**Note and facts about anterior approach:**

The ALIF is more rare because it’s much easier to perform this procedure posteriorly than by an abdominal approach. There is a limited fusion area from this approach as well.

The anterior approach is usually combined with a posterior approach (anterior/posterior fusions) because of the need to provide more rigid fixation than what the anterior approach provides.  
  
In cases where there is not a lot of instability, an ALIF alone can be sufficient. Generally, this is true in cases of single level degenerative disc disease where there is a lot of disc space collapse.  
   
Endoscopic approaches for ALIF have been abandoned because it places the great vessels (aorta and vena cava) at a greater risk.

The ALIF approach is advantageous in that, unlike the PLIF and posterolateral gutter approaches, both the back muscles and nerves remain undisturbed.

Another advantage with the ALIF is that placing the bone graft in the front of the spine allows for greater compression, and compressed bone tends to fuse better.

Lastly, a much larger implant can be inserted through an anterior approach, and this provides for better initial stability of the fusion construct.

The ALIF approach permits a wide exposure of the intervertebral disc without retraction of the spinal nerves and neurologic structures and therefore, a decreased risk of neurologic injury.
