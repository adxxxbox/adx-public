### Burns and Ventilator Concerns

_Providing safe and effective anesthesia for burn surgery requires an understanding of the pathophysiological consequences of a severe burn trauma._

Even in the absence of an inhalation injury, there are changes in pulmonary physiology in all major burn injuries. Circulating mediators are released that cause hypoxemia, increased lung vascular permeability, and altered pulmonary vascular resistance. The lung changes may become characteristic of VQ mismatch, acute lung injury (ALI), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Pending the severity of airway injury, management of the inflammation all the while maintaining good ventilation can be challenging and should not be underestimated pre or postoperatively.

Inhalation injury remains the leading cause of death in burn patient populations. There are no solid measures to determine which patients will progress to severe or complete airway obstruction.

**Pulmonary derangements predispose patients to:**  
Reactive airway disease  
Laryngospasm  
Bronchospasm  
V/Q Mismatch  
Decrease in pulmonary compliance  
Pneumonia  
Pulmonary failure  
Airway debris, tenacious secretions, or casts

**Pulmonary Treatment Modalities**  
Tracheal intubation /mechanical ventilation  
Frequent suctioning of copious and tenacious airway secretions  
Bronchodilators  
Inhaled corticosteroids are typically not recommended due to heightened infection risks

**Ventilator Settings**  
**Tidal Volume:** Low-tidal volume ventilation (LTV) of 6 mL/kg)  
**Respiratory Rate**: Higher than normal to compensate for the low tidal volume.  
**PEEP:** As needed  
**FIO2**: As low as possible to maintain PaO2 > 90mm Hg  
**Peak Inspiratory Pressures:** Keep below 30cm H20  
**ETCO2:** Permissive hypercapnia has been documented as acceptable.

**Treatment modes for severe pulmonary injury and refractory hypoxemia**  
High-frequency oscillation ventilation  
High frequency percussive ventilation  
Airway pressure release ventilation  
Inhaled nitric oxide and increasing levels of PEEP are also common therapies to suggest  
Collaboration with burn team and respiratory care is strongly suggested pre and post operatively.  
Always adjust ventilation according to individual patient needs.  
Extubation may not always be a reasonable option immediate postoperatively
