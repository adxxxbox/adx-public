### Tracheostomy (elective)

Tracheotomy: The surgical opening of the trachea.  
Tracheostomy: The creation of a stoma at the skin surface, which leads to the trachea.  
Tracheostomies may be temporary or permanent. The 2nd or 3rd tracheal ring is incised for the tracheostomy tube to be placed.  
  
Most of the time, these patients are already intubated and on the ventilator. The patient is usually delivered to you on a big ICU bed somewhere in the OR hallway with a nurse, RRT and a helper. The patient will be manually ventilated (bagged) by the RRT. Get your report and vent settings. Many times the patient will be on a Propofol drip.  
Bring some Versed and a 10cc syringe of flush so you can give Versed before you take the patient to surgery and turn off the Propofol. Sometimes we just let the Propofol drip continue and use less inhalation agent if the BP permits.

If you are in a facility that you have to go to the unit and get the patient, make sure you bring:  
Primed IV anesthesia tubing  
Versed and flush  
Transport Monitor  
Transport Tech to help  
Oxygen E cylinder (unless the ICU offers one)  
  
**Anesthesia:** General  
Some CRNAs just connect the patient to the ventilator with an inhalation agent on, not requiring Propofol.  
**Neosynephrine:** Have some available. Connecting the patient to the ventilator with an inhalation agent on may cause hypotension for the time period before surgical stimulation.  
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes  
**IV Access:** The patient already has one.  
**IV Bag:** Don’t forget to prime your own IV bag with anesthesia tubing, because the patient will not arrive with one. When you initially see the patient, locate an open IV port to connect your tubing to, or connect it in the OR.  
**FIO2:** Remember to decrease the FIO2 before cautery.  
**Position:** Supine, and the surgeon usually prefers a shoulder roll. Make sure the EKGs are positioned away from the neck. Some ENT docs are nice enough to do the procedure on the patient’s ICU bed rather than transferring them to the OR table.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Usually.  
**Pilot Balloon Line:** Tape it to the patient’s forehead with a 10cc syringe nearby. You don’t need to be struggling under the drapes when the surgeon asks you to deflate the cuff.  
**ETT Tape or holder:** Cut the tape or loosen the ETT holder before the surgeon starts. He will eventually ask you to pull back the ETT and you want to be ready. After you have pulled back the ETT enough, the surgeon will insert the trach. Quickly you should hand the surgeon the ventilator circuit over the drapes so the circuit can be connected to the trach. You should have a flex tube extender attached to the business end of the anesthesia circuit to make it easier for the surgeon. This flex extender offers more slack. Once the ETCO2 is noted on the monitor, you can remove the ETT. The surgeon will secure the trach and the procedure is complete. It is common to redose the patient with Versed and a relaxant before taking the patient back to the ICU where they came from.

**Complications:**  
Bleeding  
Infection  
Airway fire
