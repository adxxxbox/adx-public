### NO - Nitrous Oxide with CABG

Nitrous oxide is NOT recommended for CABG because it will expand air bubbles in the coronary and cerebral circulation.  
  
Nitrous oxide also increases sympathetic nervous system activity when given in a 40% concentration. At the same time, increases in forearm vascular resistance and circulating catecholamines may occur.  
  
Even though nitrous oxide directly depresses myocardial contractility in vitro, arterial blood pressure, cardiac output and heart rate are essentially unchanged or slightly elevated in vivo due to nitrous oxide’s stimulation of catecholamines.  
  
In the presence of coronary artery disease and severe hypovolemia, hypotension may occur.
