Clonidine - Adjuvant to Neuraxial Anesthesia    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Clonidine - Adjuvant to Neuraxial Anesthesia

FDA has issued a “Black Box” against the use of Clonidine in obstetrics for the concerns of hemodynamic instabilities after its use with neuraxial anesthesia.Low doses of spinal clonidine for C-sections are reported to:  
Enhance the anesthetic block  
Reduce dose of local anesthetics  
Extend postoperative analgesia  
  
There are studies that support mixing clonidine with intrathecal opioids, as there is a synergic effect. Clonidine is rarely used as a neuraxial adjuvant in OB due to the possible adverse cardiovascular effects and the FDA “Black Box” warning.  
  
**Spinal Doses  
**15mcg appears to be a popular safe dose  
30mcg has been documented to have caused bradycardia, hypotension, and sedation after use during an inguinal herniorrhaphy.  
One study recommended limiting the doses to 15 mcg and 30 mcg as this dose range has been found to provide adequate postoperative analgesia and less sedation.  
  
**Epidural Doses  
**For epidural dosing, 2 mcg/kg of clonidine added to the desired local anesthetic has been documented as a safe dose.  
  
Significant hypotension has been documented with doses > 75 mcg per epidural.Conflicting literature states that as little as 25 mcg of clonidine combined with 0.1% Ropivacaine has been associated with bradycardia and sedation.  
  
**Method of Action  
**Clonidine is a partial Alpha-2 adrenergic agonist (works like Precedex). It has been shown to prolong the duration of action of local anesthetics, especially when used as an adjunct to neuraxial anesthesia.  
Precedex has an 8:1 selectivity for Alpha-2 receptors over Clonidine making it superior.  
  
Clonidine activates a negative-feedback mechanism via its action on Alpha-2 receptors, which decreases catecholamine release. Clonidine also has cholinergic effects and increases the amount of acetylcholine available centrally. Clonidine has also been shown to prolong local anesthesia in peripheral blocks, probably by direct peripheral action.  
  
Clonidine may act on peripheral Alpha-2 receptors or reduce the vascular uptake of local anesthetic by its vascular adrenergic effects.  
  
Clonidine may exert a peripheral analgesic action by causing the release of enkephalin-like compounds. Doses up to 150 mcg administered PERIPHERALLY have minimal side-effects.
