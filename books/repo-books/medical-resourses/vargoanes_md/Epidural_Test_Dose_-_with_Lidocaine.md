### Epidural Test Dose - with Lidocaine

Today, 1.5% lidocaine is the most popular local anesthetic used for epidural test doses.  
It usually comes premixed with 1:200,000 epinephrine in a 5mL vial as part as the epidural kit.  
  
**The most common dose is 3 mLs from this same vial that yields:**  
45mg of lidocaine (15mg/mL)  
15mcg of epinephrine (5mg/mL)  
  
Lidocaine is more popular than the other two local anesthetics - bupivacaine and 2-Chloropraine for its safety and reliability.  
  
**Lidocaine vs 2-Chloroprocaine  
Lidocaine** 100 mg is a reliable marker of intravenous injection when the symptoms of **tinnitus** and **funny taste** were considered (sensitivity 100%; specificity 81%), while **2-Chloroprocaine** is less reliable (sensitivity 81% to 94%; specificity 69% to 81%).  
Unfortunately, most of us do not administer 100mg of 1.5% of lidocaine as a test dose.  
  
**I know one experienced provider who administers an extra 60mg of lidocaine after the test dose  
  
**She first administers 45mg with epi with the initial test dose and waits for the results.  
**If the test dose is negative, she immediately does the following:**  
She administers the remaining 2 mLs of the 1.5% lidocaine (30 mg) with epi vial and then the remaining 3 mLs of 1% lidocaine vial (used for the skin wheal) which is another 30mg.  
So administering an extra 65 mg AFTER a verified negative test will result in a comfortable block at the T10 dermatome level.  
  
**45 mg of intravascular injected lidocaine should result with some symptoms of local anesthetic toxicity.**  
**Ask you patient if they are experiencing:**  
Ringing in their ears  
Metallic taste in their mouth  
Tongue numbness  
Light headedness  
Disoriented  
Blurred vision  
  
**Note:** Did you ever bolus your EGD patient with50-100 mg of lidocaine to blunt their gag reflex before administering propofol? They usually inform you of the metallic mouth taste and ringing in their ears.
