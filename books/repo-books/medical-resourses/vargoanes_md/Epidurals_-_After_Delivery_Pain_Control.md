### After Delivery Pain Control

  
_Dr. Alyson Eastep, CRNA Summerton, SC_

**AFTER DELIVERY**

1.  All paperwork must be completed. This includes time of birth, sex of baby, and APGARS. BP should be recorded every hour.
2.  Catheter should be removed and this should be documented (including “tip intact”), Our nurses pull the catheters. Pumps should be disconnected and remainder of bag documented and wasted if narcotics have been added to the local anesthetic (with witness).

**How soon do we usually pull out the epidural catheter after delivery?**  
The pump is turned off immediately after delivery and the epidural catheter is capped off. The baby is kept skin to skin with mother for the first hour. Once the mother is ready to void, the nurse removes the epidural catheter and assists to the bathroom. (Usually around 2 hours after infusion is stopped.)  
  
**When does the patient usually start hurting again?**  
The patients are given scheduled Motrin to assist with pain control. Once the epidural has receded, the patient may experience cramping.  
  
**How do we treat for pain when a patient’s spinal wears off after a C-section?**  
At my facility, narcotics, (fentanyl, morphine, dilaudid, or a combination) is added to the spinal. This provides a fair amount of pain relief. As the spinal wears off, the patient may experience pain. Our C section patients are given scheduled Toradol. Anesthesia allows Percocet PO or Nubain IV to be given if additional meds are needed.  
24 hours after intrathecal narcotics (ITN), anesthesia allows pain management to be dictated by surgeon. Nubain is commonly used for itching with ITN and will also assist with pain control.  
  
Some institutions are performing TAP blocks and not administering ITN.
