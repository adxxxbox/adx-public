### Vasopressin (Pitressin) Pharmacology and Notes

Vasopressin (arginine vasopressin, AVP; antidiuretic hormone, ADH).  
Hormone formed in the hypothalamus and released from the posterior pituitary. Main function is to regulate extracellular fluid (anti-diuretic) via reabsorption in renal tubules.  
Also potent arterial and mesenteric vasoconstrictor.  
  
**Classification:**  
Pituitary antidiuretic agent.  
  
**Indications:**  
Diabetes insipidus.  
GI hemorrhage (control of bleeding esophageal varices via mesenteric vasoconstriction).  
Septic Shock: when Levophed, dobutamine and dopamine are not effective.  
  
**POTENTIAL HAZARDS:**  
Thrombophlebitis.  
Infusion may result in reduced cardiac output, angina, arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.  
Generalized vasoconstriction may cause cramping, bowel necrosis, lower limb ischemia, myocardial infarction.  
Always have nitroglycerine ready in conjunction with vasopressin to reduce cardiovascular complications  
  
**IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS:**  
Local arterial bleeding, hepatic, gastric, and intestinal infarcts have been reported.  
Hyponatremia with water retention; water intoxication.  
Caution in patients with asthma, epilepsy, migraine, heart failure, and other conditions which may be aggravated by water intoxication.  
Rapid rebound hypotension as a common problem when infusion is stopped.  
  
**Method of Action:**  
Arterial constriction.  
Mesenteric vasoconstriction.  
H2O reabsorption in renal tubules.  
  
**Onset:**  
10-15 minutes. Because vasopressin is a hormone and not a receptor agonist, it typically takes 10-15 minutes to elicit a clinical response.  
  
**Complications:**  
Avoid in patients with significant vascular disease especially PAD; cardiac ischemia, peripheral cyanosis or Ischemia, arrhythmias, oliguria, hyponatremia, H2O intoxication, tremor, vomiting, abdominal cramps  
Vasopressin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly indicated.  
  
**Mechanism of control of GI Hemorrhage:**  
Causes contraction of smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract and of all parts of the vascular bed.  
  
**Metabolism:**  
Majority rapidly destroyed by liver and kidneys.  
  
**Half Life:**  
10-20 minutes.
