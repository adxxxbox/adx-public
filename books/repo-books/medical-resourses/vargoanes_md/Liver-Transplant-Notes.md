### Liver Transplant Notes

**Indications for Liver Transplant**:Chronic hepatitis with cirrhosis.  
Primary biliary cirrhosis.Sclerosing cholangitis.Biliary atresia.Alcoholism.  
Wilson's disease.Hemochromatosis or iron overload.Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

**Maintaining a CVP 5< cm H2O:**  
A CVP<5 has been shown to provide an 80% reduction in blood loss. Fluid resuscitation results in a decrease in coagulation factors and platelet count. PRBCs and FFP should be prepared at this time.

**Mannitol**:With its potential for free radical scavenging and antioxidant properties, **Mannitol** can help remove excess free water from the abdominal organs. **Mannitol** can be used before clamping or during the anhepatic phase of liver transplantation.

**The risk of an air embolism**:  
During the manipulation of the vena cava, an air embolism should be considered in case of a sudden decrease in ETCO2 with hemodynamic instability.

**Veno-venous bypass (VVB):**  
This involves cannulation of portal and femoral veins, diverting the blood flow from IVC and portal veins to the axillary vein; improving renal perfusion pressure, lessening splanchnic congestion and delaying the development of metabolic acidosis (Findlay, 2002; Steadman, 2004). VVB improves hemodynamic stability, reduces blood loss, and allows extra time during the anhepatic phase.

Vasopressors are an alternative to veno-venous bypass. Transient inotropic support in addition to blood and fluid replacement is often required until an effective veno-venous bypass is established.

**Blood Transfusions**:Transfusion of blood leads to a large citrate load that can no longer be metabolized when the liver is removed, resulting in hypocalcemia and secondary myocardial depression.Giving periodic CaCl should be guided by ionized calcium concentration measurements to avoid HYPOcalcemia.

**Sodium Bicarbonate Therapy:**  
Should be guided by ABGs, because excessive administration may result in hypernatremia, hyperosmolality and metabolic alkalosis.

**Blood Sugars**:  
Although hypoglycemia can occur, hyperglycemia is more likely, due to the large amounts of transfused blood products. Glucose containing solutions are not used unless hypoglycemia is documented.

**Life Threatening Hyperkalemia**:  
Clinically detectable by changes in the EKG; requires prompt treatment. Calcium chloride and sodium bicarbonate are the drugs of choice for the acute treatment of hyperkalemia.

**What is Postperfusion Syndrome (PPS)?**  
A systemic hypotension and pulmonary hypertension occurring within the first 5 minutes AFTER reperfusion of the new liver. Approximately one in three patients undergoing Orthotopic Liver Transplantation or OLT has profound hypotension after reperfusion. The cause is uncertain, but a number of factors, such as hyperkalemia, acidosis, hypothermia, emboli (air or thrombotic), and vasoactive substances have been implicated. Strong vasopressors with an alpha-agonist action such as norepinephrine may be required.

Hypothermia is a marker for the presence of graft outflow into the central circulation.

**EKG Changes**:  
EKG changes require prompt treatment. Even in the absence of treatment, increased K+ levels fall spontaneously within minutes due to redistribution.

Fibrinolysis, shown by thromboelastography, should be reversed with Amicar and antifibrinolytics. Cryoprecipitate may be required.  
  
A Thromboelastogram helps assess both cellular and humoral components of whole blood coagulation and fibrinolysis; and also the effects of antifibrinolytic therapy, cryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma, platelet and protamine as treatment strategies.

Signs of graft function that may be observed in the operating room include decreased calcium requirements, improvement in acidosis, increased urine output, a rise in core temperature, and bile output from the graft.

**Postoperative complications**:  
Postoperative bleeding, biliary drainage leaks, and vascular thrombosis from either the hepatic artery or portal vein may require exploratory surgery in the early post-transplantation period. Primary graft nonfunction or graft necrosis secondary to vascular thrombosis typically necessitates retransplantation.

**Avoid LR**: Why? Because lactate metabolism will be disrupted as the liver is resected and lactate levels will go up after resection.  
Hespan or Hetastarch: These volume expanders are known to effect coags. Voluven is another starch plasma expander. Albumin is preferred since we rarely use Hespan or Voluven amymore.  

**Pre-op Antibiotics**:  
3rd generation cephalosporin and Flagyl for covering anaerobic infections.  
  
IV Heparin: 5000u prior to donor graft perfusion; it does not need reversal.

**Mid-Thoracic Epidural**: is great for post op pain but there is a risk of epidural hematoma with post op hepatectomy due to abnormal coags.

**Endocrine**:  
Carbohydrate and protein metabolism are impaired and glucose intolerance and insulin resistance occur. Serum insulin is increased from hypersecretion and decreased clearance.

**Decreased Albumin**:  
Severe drops in Albumin are seen with advanced liver failure. This decrease can lead to intravascular volume buildup of drugs like neuromuscular blockers.  
Opioids are prolonged because of the decreased volume of distribution and decreased metabolism and less drug being protein bound.

**Notes**: PAP and CVP monitoring are standard to many procedures. TEEs are becoming more popular.  
Prevent hyperthermia; this is a large open belly case.  

Since the procedure involves inferior vena obstruction, a rapid transfuser pump (or pressure bags) should be ready to infuse blood and warmed at 37C at a rate of 1.5L/min.

Be cautious with NG tubes because of esophageal varices.

Intra- op tidal volumes should only be only 6-8mL/kg. Avoid high PIPs and peep to avoid decreasing CO.

Cisatracurium and Atracurium can be used, but others are safe too.

Early extubation is a goal for the operating team, because early liver graft recovery is associated with early patient recovery.
