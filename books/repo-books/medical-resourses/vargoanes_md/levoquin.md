**Coumadin and Levoquin (quinolones) Interaction:** May increases INR and PT.  
The exact mechanism for the Coumadin-Quinolone drug interaction is unknown. Reduction of intestinal flora responsible for vitamin K production by antibiotics is probable as well as decreased metabolism and clearance of Coumadin.  
Levaquin has also been linked to tendinitis and even rupture of tendons, particularly the Achilles tendon (Black Box Warning).  
**Sun sensitivity:** Patients will become more sensitive to the sun. They should avoid prolonged sun exposure, tanning booths, and sunlamps.  
**PREGNANCY:** Levaquin should be avoided in pregnancy, as safe use in pregnant women has not been established. This medication passes into breast milk.
