### LIMA Time and Reposition the Bed

At this time when the chest is open, the surgeon will work his way to expose an Internal Mammary Artery (IMA). The Left Internal Mammary Artery (LIMA) is more commonly used. The surgeon will want to SIT for this. So you will:  
  
**Elevate the bed; surgeon will tell you how far.****  
Tilt bed slightly to the Left-so surgeon gets a better view of the LIMA (see Diagram #8 under Illustrations)**  
  
Cut the tidal volume in half, so lungs aren’t fully inflating and getting in the way. You may want to increase RR on the vent to maintain minute ventilation.  
  
The LIMA will remain attached to its origin from the left subclavian artery and the distal end will be dissected away from the chest wall, swung over, and its distal end will eventually be connected to the side of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. The pericardial sac is still intact during the isolation of the LIMA.  
  
While the pericardial sac is eventually opened, take a good look at the heart. Is it full, etc, because that is what you will be comparing it to when coming off pump.
