### Endoscopic Sinus Surgery

**Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery or FESS**

  
FESS is the endoscopic examination of the nasal and Paranasal Sinuses. The rigid nasal endoscope is a small instrument like a silver pencil with a light on the end. The surgeon gets a detailed close-up view of the internal nose and sinuses.

Functional endoscopic sinus surgery should be reserved for use in patients whom medical treatment has failed. Most of these patients have already had a CT scan.

**Indications:** Sinusitis, nasal polyps. After the examination and confirmed diagnosis, the surgeon will proceed to correct the problem.

**With this approach, the surgeon can also perform a:**  
Septoplasty  
Turbinoplasty or a Turbinate Reduction.  
Ethmoid procedures.  
Sphenoid Procedures.  
Polypectomy  
Nasal septoplasty  
   
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT using an oral Rae; consider an LTA kit.  
**Muscle Relaxant:** Theoretically, the patient does not need to be relaxed, but we usually do to avoid bucking.  
**Inhalation Agent:** Sevo or Forane are popular for these procedures.

**Duration:** 45-90 minutes  
**EBL:** 10-50 mLs.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
**Positioning:** Supine and the HOB up 10-20 degrees or reverse T-berg. Tuck the arm on the side of the bed where the surgeon sits or stands.  

**Antiemetics:** Yes, Decadron and Zofran are acceptable.

**NGT:** For the surgeon to pass ORALLY after the throat pack is out.  
**Avoid hypertension:** to minimize bleeding but stay within 20% of the patient BP base. Consider a beta-blocker with emergence. You can titrate your inhalation agent to the desired BP.  
**Emergence:** Smooth, avoid coughing.

Consider Robinul to prevent secretions from draining onto and agitating the vocal cords.

Gently suction the oral pharynx with a catheter (not a Yankauer). At the end of the operation it is good to have a nasal packing of sponge dressings in each nostril to soak up any blood. This is kept in for a few hours. The patient is now an obligate mouth breather.  
**Extubation:** Deep or Awake? Many CRNAs will extubate deep. Some patients may require an awake extubation, so try to make it smooth. Xylocaine .25 mg/kg is the trick.
