### Burn Shock Phase followed by a Hypermetabolic Phase

_Providing safe and effective anesthesia for burn surgery requires a fundamental understanding of the pathophysiological consequences of major burn injury. Understanding the mechanism of injury will aid the examination and treatment as to NOT overlook masked injuries; e.g., small to no gross external injury in an electrocution, chemical pneumonitis from inhalation, or thermal injury post flame or closed space exposure._

**Early  
**Increased metabolic rate  
Increased CO2 production  
Increased oxygen utilization  
Impaired thermal regulation  
  
**Burn Shock  
**In addition to the local effects of burn injury, major burns cause the release of circulating mediators such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukins that result in a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Within 6 to 8 hours of injury, increased microvascular permeability, vasodilatation, vascular stasis, decreased cardiac contractility, and reduced cardiac output result in massive edema formation in both injured and noninjured tissues

A massive leak of fluid and electrolytes from the intravascular space into the interstitial space, combined with fluid losses through drainage and evaporation from burn wounds, further impairs tissue perfusion.

Rapid and effective intravascular volume replacement is critical to the prevention or reduction of burn shock. Burn shock is a combination of distributive, hypovolemic, and cardiogenic shock, in which plasma volume is insufficient. The reductions in preload and cardiac output result in tissue HYPOperfusion.

Failure to adequately replace intravascular volume can lead to significant **organ injury** from systemic inflammatory responses and multi-organ dysfunction. In the event that fluid resuscitation is successful, a pronounced hypermetabolic response develops over several days to weeks.  
  
**Hypermetabolic Phase**  
The HYPERmetabolic response to burns is more severe and sustained than any other form of trauma.  
A massive surge in catecholamines and corticosteroids, 10 to 50 times greater than nonburned plasma levels, drives the hypermetabolic response causing increased myocardial oxygen consumption and cardiac work. Their energy expenditure increases by 60-100% above normal often with subsequent insulin resistance and increased risk of infection.

  

The **Hypermetabolic Phase consists of:  
**Persistent tachycardia  
Systemic hypertension  
Increased muscle protein degradation  
Insulin resistance  
Elevated core temperature  
Liver dysfunction

Cardiac output and heart rate increase up to 150% above nonburned patient values and may remain elevated for up to 2 years postburn.

Hyperventilation occurs during the hypermetabolic phase and persists until wound closure.

Elevated metabolic rates also compensate for the large amounts of heat and water lost through disrupted tissues; up to 4,000 mL per m2 burn area per day.

Proteins and amino acids are mobilized to meet immense metabolic demands and energy requirements, resulting in significant loss of lean body mass that further impairs immune function and wound healing.  
  
The severity of the HYPERdynamic, HYPERcatabolic response is related to Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) burned and the duration of time patients are exposed to elevated levels of catecholamines and stress hormones.

Left untreated, HYPERmetabolism leads to physiologic exhaustion and death.  
  
**Strategies used to ameliorate the HYPERmetabolic response include:**  
Early surgical intervention (burn wound excision and closure)  
Maintenance of a warm environment (thermo-neutral)  
Nutritional support to replenish catabolic losses  
Insulin and β-antagonists.  
  
Early excision and grafting of burn eschar attenuates the hypermetabolic response by preventing further net protein loss, catabolism, and the development of sepsis.

Warming the environment to a neutral temperature (28-33°C) has been shown to reduce the magnitude of the hypermetabolic response.
