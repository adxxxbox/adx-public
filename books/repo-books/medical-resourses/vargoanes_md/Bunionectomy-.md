### Bunionectomy or Exostectomy

Hallux Abductus Valgus Deformity or bunion removal/correction.

This surgery is the removal of part of the first metatarsal head, which is the part of the big toe that is bulging out. This procedure involves more than just simply shaving the boney protrusion. It typically requires that the deviated bones be structurally realigned. Milder bunions are corrected with bone cuts close to the big toe joint. Larger bunions typically need a more "involved" bone cut or a fusion procedure to completely realign the structural problem. Bunions may return after surgery, especially if the patient continues to wear narrow or high-heeled shoes.  
**Anesthetic**: General/usually an LMA.  
**Regional:** Spinals can be done but it is rare to see one done for this case.  
**Position:** Supine  
**Duration:** 60-90 minutes. The procedure time is greater with a Podiatrist versus an orthopedic surgeon.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
**Antibiotic:** Usually Ancef.  
  
**Possible Complications:**  
Chronic foot pain.  
Foot deformity.  
Stiff foot.  
Hallux varus occurs with a surgical over-correction, where the toe points away from the second toe.  
A return of another Bunion after surgery, which requires a revision.  
  
**Other Notes  
Hallux:** Big toe; great toe.

**Hallux Abductus**: A fixed angulation of the hallux directed away from the body midline.

**Hallux** **Abductus Valgus Deformity:** same as above

**Metatarsal osteotomy:** Removal of a small wedge of bone from the foot.  
**Phalangeal osteotomy:** Removal of a small wedge of bone from the toe.
