Sphenoidectomy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Sphenoidectomy

The sphenoid sinus is located above the roof of the mouth behind the nose. It develops rapidly between 5 and 7 years of age and is complete by age 20 to 25 years. The sphenoid bone separates the sphenoid sinus from the brain.

Chronic sphenoid sinusitis is a common problem with serious consequences. Ocular disturbance, blindness and even death can occur as a consequence of this chronic infection.

**Indications:**  
Sphenoidal sinusitis.  
Sphenoidal mucocele.  
Neoplastic disease within the sphenoidal sinus.  
Traumatic CSF rhinorrhea originating in the sphenoid.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT using an oral Rae; consider an LTA kit.  
**Muscle Relaxant:** Theoretically, the patient does not need to be relaxed, but we usually do to help prevent coughing.  
**Inhalation Agent:** Sevo or Forane are popular for these procedures.

**Duration:** 45-90 minutes  
**EBL:** 50-150 mLs.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
**Lab results-Coags:** Always check results.  
**Positioning:** Supine with the HOB up 10-20 degrees or reverse Trendelenburg. The side of the bed that the surgeon sits on should have the arm tucked.  Sometimes the bed is rotated 90 degrees.

**Antiemetics:** Yes to Decadron and Zofran. Sometimes the surgeon will order an 8-12mg dose of Decadron prior to the start of surgery.

**NGT:** For the surgeon to pass ORALLY after the throat pack is out.  
**Avoid hypertension:** To minimize bleeding, but stay within 20% of the patient’s base BP. Consider a beta-blocker with emergence. You can titrate your inhalation agent to the desired BP.  
**Emergence:** Smooth, avoid coughing. Consider Robinul to prevent secretions from draining onto and agitating the vocal cords. Gently suction the oral pharynx with a catheter (not a Yankauer). At the end of the operation, it is customary practice to have a packing of sponge dressings in each nostril to soak up any blood. This is kept in for a few hours. The patient is now an obligate mouth breather.  
**Extubation:** Deep or Awake? Many CRNAs will extubate deep. Some patients may require an awake extubation, so try to make it smooth. Xylocaine .25 mg/kg helps.

Some CRNAs insert an LMA immediately after a deep extubation and transport the patient to the recovery room. The LMA is removed when the patient awakes. This drastically decreases turnover time.

**Risk of sinus surgery**: Bleeding, Blindness, Eye Muscle Injury, Spinal Fluid Leak, Meningitis.

After the sinuses are completely healed, there is an 80 to 95% chance that the sinus problems will be significantly better.

**Possible Complications:**

Loss of midline, resulting in injury to the carotid artery, cavernous sinus or optic nerves.  
Septal perforation.  
Post op Epistaxis.  
Post op CSF rhinorrhea.  
 

**Spinal Fluid Leak: CSF rhinorrhea**

If the surgeon notices a leakage of spinal fluid, he/she will stop the procedure and the patient will be admitted for observation.
