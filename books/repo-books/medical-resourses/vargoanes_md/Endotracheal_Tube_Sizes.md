## Endotracheal Tube Sizes

For predicted uncuffed OETT size = (Age / 4) + 4  
  
Predicted Size Cuffed OETT size = (Age / 4) + 3 also 16 + Age (years) / 4 = ETT size  
  
Also another method for predicted uncuffed OETT - subtract 0.5 if the patient < 10kg ex uncuffed 4.0mm, so cuffed 3.5mm subtract 1.0 if kid > 10kg
