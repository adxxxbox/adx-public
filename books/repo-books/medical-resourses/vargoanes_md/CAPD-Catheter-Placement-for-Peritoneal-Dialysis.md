### CAPD Catheter Placement for Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) Laparoscopic

PD catheter insertion can be done by 1 of 3 techniques; dissective surgical, blind or modified Seldinger, or laparoscopic techniques. Laparoscopic is the only method that allows for the direct visualization of the intra-peritoneal structures.

Remember, these are ESRD patients, so know their K+ level and don’t over-hydrate them.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
Atracurium or Nimbex are the optimal muscle relaxants to use. Most of us still use low dose Zemuron or Norcuron.  
**Duration:** 45-90 minutes.  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable

**Position:** Supine, 1 or both arms out depending on surgeon’s preferences. Reverse Trendelenburg while testing the new catheter. The surgeon usually tests the drainage by connecting the catheter to a drainage bag. However, some surgeons just flush the catheter, take a picture and finish the procedure.

**Possible Complications:**  
Bowel perforation  
Catheter malposition, kinking of the catheter  
Bleeding  
Dialysate leakage  
Post-op peritonitis
