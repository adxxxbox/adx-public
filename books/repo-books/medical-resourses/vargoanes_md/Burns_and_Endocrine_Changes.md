### Burns and Endocrine Changes

**With a burn injury, there may be a huge release of:  
**Corticotropin  
Antidiuretic Hormone  
Renin  
Angiotensin  
Aldosterone  
Glucagon  
CatecholaminesInsulin levels can be increased or decreased.

Hyperglycemia is common in burn patients. It can be secondary to feeding and possibly insulin resistance after a burn injury.  
With hyperglycemia, these patients may be susceptible to the development of nonketotic hyperosmolar coma.  
Checking glucose levels and a sliding scale should be implemented perioperatively if the patient does NOT have an acceptable glucose preoperatively. Elevated sugar levels are associated with infection and wound healing.

Electrolytes should also be frequently checked and corrected as necessary to prevent arrhythmias. It is the potassium, calcium, and magnesium levels that you need to watch. Abnormal RAAS activation coupled with aggressive resuscitation efforts can result in electrolyte imbalance.  
Hyponatremia and phosphatemia are commonly abnormal during the early postburn period.

Maximum increases in serum norepinephrine occur 3-4 days after the burn injury. Levels may reach 26 times the normal level.

The huge increase in catecholamines cause severe vasoconstriction in the skin and splanchnic vessels; reassessment of labs and physical examination is necessary.  
  
**Other possible complications from severe increases in of endogenous Norepinephrine:  
**Ischemia of the GI tractLiver dysfunction  
Curling’s ulcer  
Oliguria  
DIC  
Cardiac dysfunction  
Hypersensitive crises  
Increased body temperature  
  
  
Hydralazine is a popular vasodilator to offset the vasoconstriction to improve perfusion in the early post burn phase.
