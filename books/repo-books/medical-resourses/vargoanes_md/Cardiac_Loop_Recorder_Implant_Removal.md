### Cardiac Loop Recorder Implant Removal

**Loop recorder:** An implantable cardiac monitor/recorder is a paper clip-sized Bluetooth device that can be implanted just underneath the skin, left of the sternum.  
  
**This device can serve as a:**  
Continuous ECG-recording machine  
Record the patient’s heart rhythm for up to 3 years.

**Loop insertion:** Performed under local anesthesia (anesthesia services not required).  
**Loop removal:** Usually MAC with a propofol infusion.  
  
**Insertion Procedure:  
**\- The cardiologist will inject a local anesthetic to numb the area.\- A small incision of about 2-4 cm in length is made in the chest wall\- A small pocket is made underneath the skin to accommodate the device.\- The device is inserted into the pocket under the skin, and the wound is then closed with dissolvable sutures.  
\- Steri-strips are applied

Removal Procedure:  
**\-The cardiologist will inject a local anesthetic to numb the area.  
\- A small incision is made to remove the device.  
\- The wound is closed using sutures and a skin adhesive.  
**Anesthesia:** MAC (usually propofol infusion)  
**Location:** Usually, EP lab  
**Common cocktail:  
**50-100 mcg of Fentanyl  
50 mcg/kg/min of propofol (titrate to effect)  
  
**Duration:** 10-20 minutes (depends on scar tissue)  
**Position:** Supine with arms tucked  
**EBL:** Minimal  
  
**Possible complications:** Minimal  
Hematoma  
Infection  
  
**More notes:**  
**The device will last three years under the following usage scenarios:**  
Average of 1 auto-detected event per day  
Average of 1 patient-initiated event per month  
Less than or equal to 6 months shelf life between device manufacture and insertion  
PVC Burden disabled  
The most significant advantage of this system is for patients who have symptoms that are not that frequent—that is, patients who may present with syncope once every several months or even yearly, in which case short-term external monitors have limited utility.  
  
In addition, the issue of patient compliance in tolerating bulky external monitors is eliminated.  
  
These small devices are in a metal alloy casing with an internal battery and microchips for recording and storing the tracings of heart rhythm.
