### Aortic Valve Replacement for Aortic Stenosis

**Aortic valve stenosis:**  
These stiff, fused, thickened, inflexible valve leaflets lead to the narrowing of the aortic valve that limits the blood flow. Aortic valve stenosis progresses when calcium is deposited on the valve leaflets, further limiting their mobility. Stenosis can occur in patients with either a tricuspid (3 leaflets) or a bicuspid (2 leaflets) aortic valve.

AVR is usually frequently done through a median sternotomy. Once the pericardium has been opened, the patient is placed on Bypass. A cut is made in the aorta and a cross clamp applied. The surgeon then removes the patient's diseased aortic valve and a mechanical or tissue valve is put in its place. Once the valve is in place and the aorta has been closed, the patient is taken off the heart-lung machine.  

**Pre-op Equipment and IV Access:**  
Same as a CABG  
  
**Premedication:**  
Always sedate pre-op.  
Benzodiazepines: reduce the dose if the patient is frail or elderly. Some places place the lines and catheters in the patient in a pre-op area, while others wait until the patient is in  the operating room.  
   
**Catheters**  
2 large peripheral IVs 16 or 18 gauge-LR  
A-line  
PA Catheter  
Trauma line or a Cordis  
 

**PA Line Ports**   
**White** –connect to trifurcate (crows feet)-Neo, Nitro and LR  
**Brown** to CVP  
**Blue** to PA  
Colors may vary.  
Cordis or Trauma line- Blood tubing –connect main blood tubing.  
**Note**: You can float the pulmonary catheter early in the case. Pull it back before going on bypass.  
**2 blood sets** –one on warmer, one to trauma cord. Make sure all IVs run well BEFORE and AFTER the arms are tucked. I have seen terrible infiltrations with tucked arms.

**Anesthetic Goals**  
**Preload:** Increase to maintain. You want to maintain their fixed stroke volume.  
**Warning:** A high filling pressure may reflect a low LV compliance and diastolic dysfunction and not the true LVEDP. TEEs are great for assessing this.  
**Afterload:** Maintain to keep coronary perfusion stable. Avoid sudden increases and/or decreases in SVR. They may exhibit angina without CAD. The afterload is already elevated from the bad valve.  
**Vasodilators**: Avoid  
**Rate:** Normal sinus, maintain at 60-90bpm.  Avoid severe bradycardia because it’s associated with decreased CO from the fixed stroke volume. These patients are _heart rate_ _dependent_.  
**Supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias:** You need to avoid: Amiodarone is commonly started.  
**Tachycardia:** Avoid. May cause ischemia and ventricular ectopy.  Treat with Esmolol.  
**Frequent PVCs:** treat with IV Lidocaine.

**Contractility:** Maintain

**Central Neuraxial Analgesia:**  
Epidurals for open heart surgery probably won’t work too well but you should be aware that all regionals cause a big loss in PVR, SVR, and BP.  
**Hemodynamics:** Patients must have adequate intravascular volume to fill the noncompliant ventricle.

**Weaning Off Bypass:**  
Remember that a noncompliant LV is dependent on a stable rhythm for adequate healing.  
An Inotropic agent may be needed to wean off pump, especially with LV dysfunction or with incomplete myocardial revascularization.

However, there are still many of these patients that drastically improve when the new valve is in.  Their ventricle has been preconditioned to generate higher pressures. 

OK to use Neosynephrine and other vasoconstrictors. There is a new aortic valve.  
  
TEE is essential for coming off for fluid and hemodynamic management. It will give you the LV function and a good look at the results of the new valve. Treat the patient according to their individual needs, just like any other heart.

  
**Other Notes**  
About 80% of aortic valves are replaced with a bioprosthesis.  
Biological valves can be made from pig tissue (porcine), cow tissue pericardial (bovine), or pericardial tissue from other species.
