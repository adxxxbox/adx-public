Vasopressin (Pitressin)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Vasopressin (Pitressin)

**Class:** Pituitary - antidiuretic agent.  
Vasopressin (arginine vasopressin, AVP; antidiuretic hormone, ADH)  
A hormone naturally formed in the hypothalamus and released from the posterior pituitary.  
**  
Doses:**  
**Quick Remedy:** Dilute to 1unit/mL in a 10mL syringe. Give 1-2 unit bolus to temporarily increase BP to buy you some time to start a drip.  
Repeat if necessary-titrate to effect.  
  
**Dose IV Infusion Range:** 1-6 units/hr  
Vasopressin 1unit/mL

| Dose | IV Rate |
| --- | --- |
| 1unit/hr | 1mL/hr |
| 2unit/hr | 2mL/hr |
| 3unit/hr | 3mL/hr |

**Main function:** to regulate ECF (anti-diuretic) via reabsorption in renal tubules.  
Also a potent vasoconstrictor; Arterial, mesenteric.  
Anesthesia Indications: Hypotension unresponsive to neosynephrine and ephedrine (especially if the patient is on an ACE Inhibitor).  
**  
ICU Indications:**  
Diabetes Insipidus  
GI Bleed (control of bleeding esophageal varices- mesenteric vasoconstriction). It causes contraction of smooth muscle of the GI tract and of all parts of the vascular bed.  
Septic Shock-when Levophed, Dobutamine and/or Dopamine are not effective.  
**  
Method of Action**  
Arterial constriction  
Mesenteric vasoconstriction  
H2O reabsorption in renal tubules  
  
**Onset**  
10-15minsutes  
Because vasopressin is a hormone and not a receptor agonist, a low dose drip can take 10-15 minutes to elicit a clinical response.  
**  
Metabolized**  
Majority rapidly destroyed by liver and kidneys.  
**  
Half Life**  
10-20 mins  
**  
Complications**  
Avoid patients with significant vascular disease esp. AD; cardiac ischemia, peripheral cyanosis or Ischemia, arrhythmias, oliguria, hyponatremia, H2O intoxication, tremor, vomiting, abdominal cramps.  
**  
POTENTIAL HAZARDS**  
Thrombophlebitis  
Infusion may result in reduced cardiac output, angina, arrythmias and cardiac arrest.  
Always have nitroglycerine ready in conjunction with vasopressin to reduce cardiovascular complications.  
Generalized vasoconstriction - cramping, bowel necrosis, lower limb ischemia, myocardial infarction.  
**  
IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS**  
Local arterial bleeding, hepatic, gastric, and intestinal infarcts have been reported. Hyponatremia with water retention; water intoxication.  
Caution in patients with asthma, epilepsy, migraine, heart failure, and other conditions which may be aggravated by water intoxication. Rapid rebound hypotension as a common problem when infusion is stopped.  
**  
Other Notes**  
Used in septic and vasodilatory shock along with catecholamines to help raise BP and reduce the duration and doses of them.  
In healthy individuals, it does not appear to play a role in BP regulation. Individuals with high levels do not necessarily display hypertension. In shock states-release of endogenous vasopressin is an important vasoconstrictor mechanism.  
At greater than physiologic doses, it has a pressor effect due to vasoconstriction and causes contraction of the smooth muscle. It increases secretion of corticotropin, which is a hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland that stimulates the adrenal cortex. The adrenal cortex produces cortisol which is a major hormone responsible for blood pressure regulation.  
Vasopressin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.
