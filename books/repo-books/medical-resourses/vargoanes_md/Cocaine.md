# Cocaine

Ester type Local Anesthetic  
It is the only naturally occurring local anesthetic in medical use today.  
Commercially available in a variety of forms and it is applied to mucous membranes of the oral, laryngeal, and nasal cavities for use as a topical anesthetic.  
Causes significant euphoria. Despite potent analgesic, it is not very popular because it is a potent vasoconstrictor.  
Well absorbed from all mucous membranes.  
When used for topical anesthesia, the onset of action occurs within 1 minute, and maximum effect is within 5 minutes. The duration of action is about 30 minutes.  
**Doses:**

Coca-Cola contained approximately 4.5 mg/180 mL. It was becoming addictive. The Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914 essentially banned distribution of cocaine in the United States, except by prescription.
