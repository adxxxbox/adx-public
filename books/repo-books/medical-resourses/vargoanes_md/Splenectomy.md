Splenectomy: Laparoscopic or Open     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Splenectomy: Laparoscopic or Open

  
The surgical removal of the spleen. These can be done laparoscopically or open. If the spleen is not enlarged, laparoscopic is preferred.

This is one of those cases in which you prepare for a possible large blood loss, but it almost always turns out very well.

Many of these are cancer patients that have been on some potent chemotherapeutic meds, which may contribute to pulmonary/renal and CNS issues. (See notes below)

Usually a midline abdominal incision provides access to the spleen and gives maximum exposure. The splenic artery is clamped and ligated first. This lets the spleen disengorge and facilitate the return of venous blood to circulation. Then the splenic vein is clamped and ligated. The spleen is then removed.

**Indications:** 

Trauma

Hodgkin’s disease.  
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas.  
Some types of leukemia.  
ITP (idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura).  
Tumors or cysts.

Splenomegaly  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT

**Epidural:** optional for post op pain, but not common.

**Duration**: 2-4 hours.  
**Position:** Supine with reverse Trendelenburg and a slight tilt to the left.  
**Cell Saver:** Yes  
**Type and Crossed:** Yes, with 2 units of blood on standby.  
If the patient has ITP with a low platelet count, you just should NOT administer the patient platelets pre-op because their spleen will just consume the platelets. Platelets can be given after the splenic vein is ligated.  
**IV Access:** 2 large bore IVs.  
**A-line:** Sometimes, not common anymore.  
**NG tube:** Always.  
**EBL:** 50-100mLs, but has the potential for much more.  
**Foley:** Sometimes.  
 

**Complications:**  
Hemorrhage  
Left Lower Lobe Atelectasis.  
Injury of the tail of the pancreas.

**More Notes**

Patients with splenomegaly may have a degree of LLL Atelectasis.  
  
**Some Chemotherapy Drugs to be aware of:**  
Bleomycin may cause pulmonary fibrosis.

Methotrexate and cytarabine may cause pulmonary fibrosis.

Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) may cause cardiotoxicity with a decreased QRS amplitude, CHF or pleural effusions.

Get an ECHO or MUGA for an LV function assessment.  
  
**Post Splenectomy increases risk for certain infections:**

Fulminant sepsis or meningitis with septic shock and DIC has been documented as post splenectomy infections. It has a case fatality rate of 50% if these occur. The risk is greater in the first 2 years of post-splenectomy, although it persists throughout life.

These patients will receive vaccinations for life.

**Splenectomy patients are prone to** **capsulated microorganisms such as:** 

Streptococcus pneumonia (pneumococcus).  
Haemophilus influenza type b.

Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus)

These patients will receive vaccinations for the infections processes listed above at 2 weeks prior to surgery to achieve an optimal humoral response.
