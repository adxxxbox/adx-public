**Also called:**  
butt enhancement  
gluteal augmentation  
buttock augmentation  
  
BBL is a plastic surgery procedure that augments the gluteal region of the body.  
It involves removal and transfer of about 800-1,000 cc of fat via liposuction from one or more areas of the body into the buttock or the hip area.  
  
This procedure involves extensive liposuction from multiple sites of the body (abdomen, thighs etc) involving different positions, thus endotracheal intubation is most commonly done.  
  
**Anesthesia:** General/ETT, rarely an LMA due to prone position and duration.  
**Regional:** Not indicated.  
**Duration:** 3-4 hours.  
**Position:** Supine and possibly lateral for liposuction, then prone for fat transfer.  
**EBL:** Depends on type of liposuction.  
  
**Possible complications:**  
Because liposuction is 1/2 of the operation, those added risks are also involved.  
Necrosis (formation of lumps in the buttocks).  
Infection.  
Asymmetry.  
Hematoma.  
Over-correction (too much fat removed or reinjected).  
Under-correction (too little fat removed or reinjected).  
Fat reabsorption.  
Prolonged swelling.  
Skin necrosis.  
Contour irregularities (lumpiness).  
Thrombus/pulmonary embolus.  
Nerve damage.  
  
**More Notes:**  
Former Miss Argentina died from a pulmonary embolus after buttock-enhancement surgery.
