### Eclampsia

_(seizures associated with preeclampsia)  
_Incidence: 0.1-5.9 per 10,000 pregnancies  
**Mechanism of eclampsia:** Unknown  
  
Hypertension is the most common medical problem encountered during pregnancy, complicating 5-10% of pregnancies.  
  
Classified into 4 categories:

-   Chronic Hypertension (of any cause).
-   Gestational Hypertension.
-   Preeclampsia/eclampsia.
-   Preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension.

The increase usage of magnesium sulfate drips have decreased the incidence rate.  
Seizures can occur any point during pueroperium.  
  
**Puerperium:** the time from the delivery of the placenta through the first few weeks after the delivery.  
Most occur during intrapartum (during labor or childbirth) or the first 48 hours after childbirth.  
  
Most eclampsia patients are associated with severe preeclampsia.  
However, 10-15 % of eclampsia patients do not have do not eclampsia and/or proteinuria.  
  
**Associated Risk of Eclampsia  
**Young maternal age  
Nulliparity (woman who has never had a child)  
Multiple gestation  
Molar pregnancy  
Triploidy (rare chromosomal abnormality)  
Preexisting hypertension  
Renal or cardiac disease  
Previous sever preeclampsia or eclampsia  
Nonimmune hydrops fetalis  
Lupis  
  
**Major Maternal Complications of Eclampsia  
**Aspiration  
Pneumonia  
Pulmonary edema  
CVA  
Cardiac Arrest  
VTE  
Acute renal failure  
Death  
  
**Clinical Symptoms  
**Headache - most common.  
Visual disturbances - most common.  
Photophobia.  
Epigastric or RUQ pain.  
Hyperreflexia.  
Altered mental status.  
  
**Seizure Onset:  
**May have facial twitching followed by a tonic phase lasting 15-20 seconds  
  
**If not treated, it may progress to:**  
Generalized clonic phase with apnea lasting up to 1 minute.  
Cardiac arrest and aspiration may follow.  
  
**Eclampsia (seizure) ABCs  
Airway:** turn patient to left side, jaw thrust or soft nasopharyngeal airway.  
Suction airway and prevent aspiration.  
Bag Mask if needed.Connect to pulse ox.  
Magnesium Sufate drip.  
Antihypertensive meds.  
  
**Anesthesia Management  
**Close neuro assessment and watch for seizure (especially facial twitching)  
Limit Fluids to 75-100 mLs/hour. Avoid cerebral edema.  
Maintain BP-systolic < 160mmHg and diastolic < 110mmHg.  
Keep BP within 20% of baseline.  
Monitor SaO2 and FHT.  
Monitor labs – platelets.  
Avoid hypoventilation - lowers the seizure threshold. Don’t over sedate.  
Avoid hypoxia, hyperthermia and hyperglycemia.  
  
Magnesium Sulfate is the drug of choice for preventing & arresting eclamptic seizures.Magnesium therapy is contraindicated in the presence of pulmonary edema, renal failure & myasthenia gravis.  
  
Additional benefits:

-   Vasodilation, reduction in blood pressure & increased CO by reducing SVR.
-   Reducing the incidence of placental abruption.
-   Prevention of uterine contractions with pre-term labor.
-   Neuroprotective effects for the premature fetus.
-   _Reduced incidence of cerebral palsy._
-   _Stabilization of cerebral circulation/cerebral blood flow versus prevention of excitatory injury._

Magnesium dose: 4 GM IV bolus over 10-20 mins followed by an infusion of 1-2 GM/hr.  
Narrow therapeutic range: serum level 5-9 mg/dlIf toxicity is present, 1 GM (10mL of 10%) calcium gluconate given over 10 minutes should counteract its effects.
