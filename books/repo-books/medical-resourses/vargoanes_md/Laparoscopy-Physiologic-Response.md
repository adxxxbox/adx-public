### Laparoscopy - Physiological Effects of Pneumoperitoneum

With any Laparoscopic procedure, visualization of the peritoneal cavity is usually assisted by a pneumoperitoneum that distends and separates the abdominal wall from its contents. Unfortunately, the pneumoperitoneum  increases intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), which causes physiological adverse affects to the patient. 

For these procedures requiring a pneumoperitoneum, you must be mindful of the each patient's underlying cardiopulmonary status and anticipate the hemodynamic response.   

**Short Version:**

**CardiovascularA decrease in BP:** For decreases in BP (without any bradycardia), we usually just give Neosynephrine or start a drip if required.**RespiratoryDecreased FRC:** Sometimes Pressure Control Ventilation and PEEP is required, especially for obese patients in Trendelenburg.

**RenalDecreased in UO:** We usually don’t worry about this. It subsides after insufflation has ended.  
  
**GI:** There is an increased risk of regurgitation of gastric contents, especially with obese patients. Consider inserting an OGT.**Neurological:** An increase in ICP and decrease in MAP will decrease cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), thus increasing the risk of a stroke. This is magnified in Trendelenburg position. Despite the literature, I have not read about more strokes with Robotic Prostatectomy.**Subcutaneous emphysema:** This is rare and there is not much you can do about it except increase ventilation for the patient’s elevated ETCO2. It subsides post operatively.**  
  
Why we use CO2 for the pneumoperitoneum:** CO2 is the gas of choice for laparoscopic surgeries because it is non-combustible, highly soluble, and readily eliminated through the lungs.Air is not utilized due to the risk of absorption and Venous Air Embolism.

  
  
**Long Detailed Version**

**Cardiovascular Response:**The CV response to increased IAP appears to be phasic. Initially the venous return and cardiac filling pressures increase due to upward mechanical pressure on the diaphragm. This also increases intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressures. These pressures compress the splanchnic venous bed and inferior vena cava, which cause the changes below. **So INITIALLY there is a:**Increased CVPIncreased PCWPIncreased right and left side cardiac filling pressuresIncreased Cardiac OutputIncreased SVR. Why?  Because of the direct effects of the IAP and an increase in the release of circulating catecholamines, especially epinephrine and norepinephrine.

**After a short transient phase, things get worse from the ongoing increase in IAP.**The SVR becomes greater with more insufflation of gas. This is followed by a new reduction in cardiac output. The new combination of an increased SVR, decreased cardiac output and increased HR results in a large increase in myocardial workload. A subsequent drop in BP can have a more pronounced effect in patients who are hypovolemic or have cardiovascular disease.

**Heart Rate Changes**The body increases the HR in response to a decreased stroke volume and cardiac output. The increased heart rate is in attempt to maintain cardiac output. **Severe Bradycardia and Asystole:**In a small (0.5%) subset of otherwise healthy patients, severe bradycardia and asystole can occur during CO2 insufflation and pneumoperitoneum.

Some researchers believe the bradycardia resulting from the increased IAP causes a direct pressure on the vagus nerve, which in turn causes a stimulatory parasympathetic effect that leads to a drop in heart rate. A more popular theory is that the rapid excessive stretching of the peritoneum may produce profound bradycardia via a vagal reflex. Don’t lay awake nights thinking about the why in this case. Know before you put the mask over the patient’s face and tell them to take 6-7 big deep breaths exactly what you will do if you get a drop in HR, BP, or both. Also have 2-3 other options behind that.

**Neurological**An increased ICP may decrease the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), especially if there is a reduction in cardiac output with the patient in steep Trendelenburg. Despite the literature, I have not read about strokes occurrences with Robotic Prostatectomy.

  
**Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP)** MAP-ICP (or CVP) = CPPNormal CPP = 70-110 mmHgCPP < 50 mmHg   = slowing of the EEGCPP 25-40 mmHg = flat EEGCPP < 25 mmHg = irreversible brain damage.

  
**Subcutaneous emphysema and/or pneumomediastinum**  These may occur from the incorrect positioning of the gas insufflation needle or trocars, anatomical anomalies or by gas dissecting across weak tissue planes attributable to the increased abdominal pressure.If you notice your patients ETCO2 increasing for no obvious reasons, palpate your patient’s chest for Subcutaneous emphysema. I have seen it spread up into the face by the time the procedure was completed. Surgeons are not concerned because it subsides after the procedure.

  
**Venous gas embolism:**This is very rare. This happens when carbon dioxide is insufflated directly into a blood vessel or by gas being drawn into an open vessel by the Venturi effect. The physiological effects caused by carbon dioxide are less than those that occur with air because carbon dioxide has a greater blood solubility.

**Symptoms:** hypotension, desaturation, and a ‘mill wheel’ murmur.**  
  
Treatment:**Treatment includes rapid deflation of the abdomen and resuscitation of the patient. If it is a large severe emboli, the patient may be placed in the left lateral position and a central line is placed to aspirate air. A TEE should be performed before this.

**Respiratory Effects**With CO2 insufflation and increases in IAP, the diaphragm is pushed in a cephalad direction in the thoracic cavity, thereby limiting downward diaphragmatic excursions during respiration. Overall functional respiratory capacity, vital capacity, and pulmonary compliance drop with each increase in IAP, and peak airway and plateau pressures can increase by as much as 50% and 81%, respectively. This is why we normally have to switch our ventilator mode to Pressure Control Ventilation during laparoscopic procedure in steep Trendelenburg. These cases are usually a Robotic hysterectomy or a Prostatectomy.

**PEEP May be Required**Although laparoscopy is generally well tolerated, patients with underlying chronic COPD or morbid obesity are at high risk for pulmonary decompensation and may require PEEP for adequate gas exchange.This is especially true in steep Trendelenburg for most patients under a general anesthetic.

**GI Effects**Increased IAP may cause regurgitation of gastric contents with associated risk of pulmonary aspiration. This is particularly significant in the obese patient. Insertion of an OGT with obese patients having laparoscopy procedures should be considered.

**Renal Effects** Oliguria (urine output <0.5 mL/kg/hr) is commonly seen if not expected with increases in IAP during laparoscopy and should be considered a "normal" physiologic response. This is usually from a decrease in GFR and cardiac output. Effects are transient and reversible after insufflation is complete. So don’t overhydrate the patient trying to get a good urinary flow.  
  
**Why increased IAP Decreases Urinary Output** As IAP increases, its compressive effects on the renal vasculature, the renal parenchyma, and the IVC will decrease effective renal blood flow (ERBF), cortical and medullary perfusion, and renal venous outflow. The renal effects are mild to negligible when the IAP is less than 10mmHg, but as IAP reaches and exceeds 15 mmHg, there is a pressure-dependent reduction in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), ERBF, creatinine clearance, sodium excretion, and urinary output. At a typical IAP of 15 mm Hg, urinary output decreases by as much as 63% to 64%, GFR by 21%, and ERBF by 26%.

Despite this drop, there are no long-term renal effects, even in patients with pre-existing renal disease, and pneumoperitoneum-induced renal failure does not occur.

**With renal compression and decreased ERBF, a host of neurohormonal factors are released:**ReninAldosteroneEndothelinADH

**All of the above resulting in systemic vasoconstriction and fluid retention.** With desufflation, these mediators return to baseline levels, and a post-desufflation diuresis is generally noted in the following hours. Renal homeostasis is re-established within 24 hours after surgery with normalization of serum and urinary creatinine and electrolytes.

  
**Although the clinical implications may be minimal, immune and cytokine responses to laparoscopic surgery are both elevated.****Pneumoperitoneum causes an elevated:**CortisolC-reactive proteinTumor necrosis factor-αInterleukin (IL)-6, IL-10Granulocytic elastase CatecholaminesLeukocytes.

**These may impact the body's metabolic demand and increase energy expenditures in the postoperative setting.** 

**Positioning** **Reverse Trendelenburg**Hemodynamic changes are magnified, with drops in the cardiac index (CI) up to 50% in some reports. Venous pooling in the lower extremity occurs, producing decreased venous return, lowered ejection fraction, and also a downward CI. During a Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy, some Bariatric and esophageal  procedures, many surgeons will use reverse Trendelenburg.  
  
**Trendelenburg Position and Risk of Stroke**Venous return is increased, leading to subsequent increases in cardiac filling pressures. The CVP is elevated and the patient is at risk of a stroke if prolonged hypotension exists. This is due to an elevated CVP combined with a decreased MAP that may decrease cerebral perfusion pressure.
