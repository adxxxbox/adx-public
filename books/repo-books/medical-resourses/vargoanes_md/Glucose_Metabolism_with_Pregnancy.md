Glucose Metabolism with Pregnancy    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Glucose Metabolism with Pregnancy

There is a 56% decrease in insulin sensitivity.  
  
The insulin resistance is caused by increased levels of cortisol, human placental lactogen, and prolactin. Cortisol increases hepatic glucose production and decreases insulin sensitivity.  
  
Women who are genetically predisposed to develop type II DM are more likely to develop gestational DM.  
  
Despite insulin resistance, glucose homeostasis is maintained in normal pregnancies by a concomitant compensatory increase in insulin secretion.  
  
The intolerance to carbohydrates develops as soon as Beta-cell secretion is no longer sufficient to compensate for insulin resistance.  
  
These changes are resolved within 24 hours.
