### Cyclooxygenase (COX) Inhibitor

**Cyclooxygenase (COX) Inhibitor-Aspirin  
  
**Low-dose, long-term aspirin is an irreversible platelet inhibitor.  
  
Aspirin is the prototype NSAID and functions by irreversibly inhibiting cyclooxygenase 1 and cyclooxygenase 2.  
  
Irreversibly means for the life span of the platelets.  
  
Other NSAIDS are reversible platelets inhibitors via the inhibition of COX.  
  
COX converts Arachidonic Acid to a variety of prostaglandins and thromboxanes.  
  
Blocking formation of thromboxane A 2  in platelets, produces an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation.
