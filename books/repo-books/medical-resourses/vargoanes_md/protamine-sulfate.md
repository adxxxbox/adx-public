# Protamine Sulfate

**Protamine Sulfate(Heparin Antidote)**  
**Class:** Heparin Antagonist  
Protamine is strong base. When combined with Heparin (an acid), the anticoagulant effect is neutralized by the formation of a salt.  
In large doses, protamine itself has some anticoagulant effect.  
**Dose:** For heparin reversal is 1-1.3mg of protamine per 100 units of heparin, however this often results in protamine excess.  
**Warning:**  
Given too fast -is associated with a drop in BP due to mild to moderate vasodilation (from histamine) and mild negative inotropic effects.  
Try to slowly administer it over 5-15 minutes.  
For CABGs, some surgeons want you to inform them when the protamine is half in.  
**Preferred Route:**  
Peripheral IV and NOT central line to reduce the risk of pulmonary hypertension. Many still administer it centrally.  
Elimination from the plasma considerably faster than heparin, so free protamine is less likely to be present longer than free heparin. This can lead to **Heparin Rebound.** (See "More Notes" below)  
**Adverse Effects:**  
Possible severe hypotension  
Cardiovascular collapse  
Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema  
Catastrophic pulmonary vasoconstriction,  
Pulmonary hypertension with rapid IV injection, high doses, repeated doses, or previous exposure to protamine or protamine-containing drugs (e.g., insulin).  
**Other possible risk factors:**  
Known sensitivity to fish  
Vasectomy  
Severe left ventricular dysfunction  
Abnormal pulmonary hemodynamics  
**More Notes**  
**Protamine and Pulmonary Hypertension**  
Be aware if the patient has a history of Pulmonary Hypertension. Severe pulmonary hypertension after protamine neutralization of heparin is an infrequent but life-threatening event following cardiopulmonary bypass. Pulmonary vasodilators and the return to CPB is the standard.  
The pH is Protamine is between 6 and 7.  
Heparin pH is 5.0 to 7.5  
Heparin is a strong acid forming salts when combined with a base.  
**Protamine**  
Used in a long-acting formulation of insulin.  
Neutralize the anticoagulant effects of heparin.  
Protamine was originally isolated from the sperm heads of salmon and other species of fish.  
**Heparin Rebound**  
The rapid clearance of protamine leaves unbound heparin remaining after protamine clearance. Treatment is to give more protamine.  
Heparin rebound usually occurs several hours after heparin has been adequately neutralized by protamine sulfate but has been reported 0.5-18 hours following cardiopulmonary bypass procedure.  
The heparin-protamine complex is eliminated by the reticuloendothelial system.  
Today, Protamine is produced primarily through recombinant biotechnology.  
In patients who are allergic to fish, it can cause significant histamine release resulting in hypotension and bronchoconstriction In large doses, protamine itself has some anticoagulant effect.  
**Protamine and Post Vasectomy**  
Nucleoprotamines are a normal component of human sperm cells. Antibodies against these protamines develop in 22 to 33% of patients undergoing elective vasectomy. These antibodies, in turn, have been shown to cross-react with medicinal protamines, which are extracted commercially from the testes of salmon and certain other fish.  
This cross-reactivity against protamines raises the possibility that patients who have undergone elective vasectomy may be at increased risk of an allergic reaction developing if they are later exposed to protamine as a medication.  
Anaphalactiod response to protamine or protamine-heparin complex is rare.
