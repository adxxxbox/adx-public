### Gastric Stimulator Insertion

Gastric electrical stimulation (GES) uses a device the size of a pacemaker and is implanted subcutaneously in the abdominal wall to send mild electrical pulses through electrodes to the nerves and smooth muscle of the lower stomach.  
This stimulation helps decrease nausea and vomiting in some patients with gastroparesis.  
  
**Indication:** Chronic gastroparesis and nausea and vomiting refractory to medication.  
**Results:** Prevents nausea occurring due to gastroparesis.  
**Location of the 2 inserted leads:** In the smooth muscle about 9.5-10 cm from the pylorus along the greater curvature of the antrum; 1 cm apart.  
  
**Pre-op**  
Many of these patients are diabetic. Check blood sugars per institution protocols.  
Check electrolytes to rule out electrolyte imbalance resulting from refractory vomiting.  
  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
**Induction:** RSI  
**Intubation:** Consult with the surgeon to determine site for securement of the endotracheal tube to facilitate endoscopy.  
**Laparoscopic:** Usually.  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours.  
**Position:** Arms tucked and mild to moderate reverse Trendelenburg.  
**IV access:** 20g is acceptable. Ensure IV patency as arms are being tucked.  
**Phenylephrine drip:** Usually necessary due to reverse Trendelenburg position. Must be attached to the IV line before the arms are tucked.  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**Muscle reversal:** Consider using sugammadex in preference to neostigmine to eliminate a common cause of nausea.  
**  
Possible complications  
**Pacemaker hardware infection requiring device removal in 5% of patients, most of whom have longstanding diabetes.  
Hemorrhage: rare.

More Notes**  
The pocket watch-sized device, called a neurostimulator is surgically implanted in the right side of the abdomen. Two insulated wires are implanted into the muscle wall of the stomach then routed under the skin to the neurostimulator and connected. Once the device is activated, the wires will transmit low-energy electrical pulses to the stomach.  
Most patients are discharged from the hospital one to five days after the surgery.

Intraoperative Endoscopy  
**Intraoperative endoscopy is performed at the time of implantation to ensure that the leads are not inadvertently placed into the lumen of the stomach and are positioned appropriately in the muscularis propria of the stomach wall.  
  
**Stimulator manufacturer’s representative:** Present to verify function of the device at the end of the procedure  
  
**The gastric stimulator:**  
Delivers electrical stimuli to the stomach wall with a higher frequency (12 slow waves per minute) than the intrinsic gastric slow wave (2.5-3.5 slow waves per minute), but uses low-energy levels (300 microsecond pulse width and 4-5 mA).  
  
**Positive Results**  
Published reports indicate that this type of therapy leads to significant reductions in the frequency of nausea and vomiting.  
Weight gain of up to 8 pounds at 6 months and 15 pounds by 12 months was observed, and 79% of study participants had their jejunostomy tubes removed by 6 months.  
  
One study found that one year after the implant, the median number of vomiting episodes fell by 63 percent in people with gastroparesis due to diabetes, and 83 percent in those with an unknown cause of gastroparesis. Improvement in symptoms can happen quickly, or it may take months.  
  
The device's battery lasts from five to 10 years. When the battery is depleted, another surgical procedure is required to replace the device.  
  
Gastric emptying was not affected overall.  
However, 25% to 30% of patients did have normalization of their gastric emptying rate at 1 year.  
  
Medtronic Enterra is the most commonly implanted model.  
This therapy is reversible and can be turned off at any time by the motility specialist.
