### Precedex (Dexmedetomidine) Dosing Cheat Sheet

See total body weight vs ideal body weight information at the bottom of this page.  
Dexmedetomidine = DEX for simplification  
**Common doses per anesthesia literature and providers:  
Preparation:** Mix to achieve 4mcg/mL  
**Common vial:** 200 mcg/2 mL via (100 mcg/mL)  
  
**The common mixture to achieve 4 mcg/mL:**  
Aspirate 2 mLs from a 50 mL NS bag, inject one vial (200 mcg) = 4 mcg/mL  
Aspirate 4 mLs from a 100 mL NS bag, inject two vials (400mcg) = 4 mcg/mL  
  
**Initial bolus:** 0.5 mcg/kg x 10 -30 minutes followed by continuous infusion.  
An initial 10-minute bolus is no longer standard among anesthesia providers due to associated bradycardia and hypotension.  
  
**Continuous Infusion range:** 0.2-0.8 mcg/kg/hour  
**0.4 mcg/kg/hour drip tip:**  
If a patient weighs 70 kg, drip rate of 7 mL/hr = 0.4 mcg/kg/hr  
For an 85 kg patient, drip rate of 8.5 mL/hr = 0.4 mcg/kg/hr  
**  
Small intraoperative boluses (without a continuous infusion):**  
2-4 mcg boluses for adults (without the presence of bradycardia and/or hypotension)  
  
**Optimal time:** Prior to induction/intubation to blunt sympathetic response.  
No more than a total of 0.5 mcg/kg per procedure is common.**Suggested doses per Precedex literature:** table.tableizer-table { font-size: 12px; border: 1px solid #CCC; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; } .tableizer-table td { padding: 4px; margin: 3px; border: 1px solid #CCC; } .tableizer-table th { background-color: #104E8B; color: #FFF; font-weight: bold; }

| Criteria | Loading dose | Maintenance dose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Adult for procedures** | 1mcg/kg over 10 minutes | Followed by 0.6 mcg/kg/hr  
Titrate to effect with doses from 0.2-1 mcg/kg/hr.  
Rate of infusion should be adjusted to achieve the targeted level of sedation. |
| **Less invasive procedures  
(e.g. ophthalmic)** | 0.5 mcg/kg over 10 minutes may be suitable | Same as above |
| **Patients over 65 years** | 0.5 mcg/kg over 10 minutes | A reduction in maintenance dosage should be considered. |
| **Patients with impaired hepatic or renal function** | A dose reduction should be considered | A reduction in maintenance dosage should be considered. |
| **Awake fiberoptic** | 1 mcg/kg/hour over 10 minutes  
2-3 mcg/kg/hour has also been well documented | Followed by 0.7 mcg/kg/hr until the ETT is secured. |

| Criteria |   |
| --- | --- |
| **ERAS** | Load 0.5 mcg/kg (IBW) and infuse at 0.3-0.5mcg/kg/hr |
| **C-section with uterine manipulation  
(anxiety) before or after the baby is out.** | 4-8 mcg boluses at a time  
DEX that crosses the uteroplacental barrier is negligible. |
| **Outpatient ENT** | Bolus 4-8 mcg at a time for a total of 20 mcg.  
For peds: 4 mcg bolus up to 12 mcg total (age and kg dependent) |
| **Pediatric emergence delirium** | 0.5 mcg/kg x 1  
Exact mechanism of this effect is unknown |
| **TAVR procedures** | Start infusion at 0.7 mcg/kg/hour when the patient arrives in the OR.  
Turn off when the drapes come down |
| **Post intubation tachycardia** | 4-8 mcg bolus |

  
  
**Precedex doses per route:** table.tableizer-table { font-size: 12px; border: 1px solid #CCC; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; } .tableizer-table td { padding: 4px; margin: 3px; border: 1px solid #CCC; } .tableizer-table th { background-color: #104E8B; color: #FFF; font-weight: bold; }

| Route | Dose |
| --- | --- |
| **Oral  
**Pre-op peds dental**** | 1 mcg/kg |
| **Intramuscular  
premedication** | 2.5 mcg/kg |
| **Spinal Prolongs sensory  
and motor blockade** | 0.1-0.3 mcg intrathecal  
3 mcg is equipotent to 30 mcg of clonidine.  
5 mcg and 25 mcg of fentanyl have been compared  
to vaginal surgeries with bupivacaine anesthesia. |
| **Epidural** | 2mcg/kg in addition to local anesthetic prolongs  
the duration of analgesia and decreases the  
requirement of rescue analgesics |
| **Caudal** | 2mcg/kg with bupivacaine in peds cause more  
sedation, prolongs analgesia, less anesthetic  
consumption and less irritability |
| **Peripheral nerve block** | 1mcg/kg |
| **Buccal Peds  
1 hour before surgery** | 1 mcg/kg |
| **Intranasal  
Peds pre-op** | 1-2 mcg/kg:  
For reducing emergence delirium  
Median onset of sedation of 25 minutes  
Median duration of 85 minutes in healthy children  
undergoing elective surgery  
2 mcg/kg: Faster onset |
| **Intravenous  
Post-op sedation (ICU)** | 0.2 -0.7 mcg/kg/hour |

**Awake Intubation:** 1-2 mcg/kg/hour IV  
Though not FDA approved, 2-3mcg/kg/hr x 10 minutes has been very successful for awake intubations.  
DEX still maintains airway patency and tone, even in children with obstructive sleep apnea, making it ideal for sleep endoscopy and dynamic airway imaging.  
  
Obtunds airway reflexes while maintaining stable hemodynamic and respiratory profiles in spontaneously ventilating children and adults.  
Provides sedative properties paralleling natural sleep.**Peds emergence:** Dilute 25mcg in a 5mL syringe (5mcg/mL) and titrate (manually) to effects for a smooth emergence.  
It may delay wake-up time.  
  
**Pediatric outpatient procedures:**  
Many experienced pediatric anesthesia providers prefer to administer around 0.4 mcg/kg after induction.  
Administering DEX any later in the procedure may prolong emergence and postoperative time.  
  
**Total body weight TBW) vs Ideal body weight (IBW) is controversial.  
**An article posted in 2015 stated that DEX dosing regimens should be based on IBW rather than TBW because obese patients have a larger volume of distribution of the drug than normal-weight patients.  
It was found that plasma concentrations of DEX were higher, and elimination half-time was longer in morbidly obese patients than in non-obese patients. However, other literature often refutes this.
