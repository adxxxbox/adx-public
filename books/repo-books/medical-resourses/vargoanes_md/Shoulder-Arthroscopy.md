Shoulder Arthroscopy (basic)     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Shoulder Arthroscopy (basic)

The basic shoulder arthroscopy is NOT extensive as a rotator cuff or arthroplasty case. The positioning and anesthesia is pretty much the same except these cases are usually shorter in duration and usually do NOT require a block.

**Some Simpler Procedures:**   
Removal of loose body.  
Partial or complete Synovectomy.  
Decompression of subacromial space.  
Partial acromioplasty.  
Distal clavicle resection.  
Mumford procedure, or a distal clavicle resection.  
Chondroplasty  
Capsulorrhaphy  
Slap Repair: repair for a torn labrum.

**Anesthesia:** The same as a rotator cuff repair.

**General/ETT**: Sometimes combined with a regional Interscalene Block. Supraclavicular block is possible but they sometimes don’t cover the proximal upper arm.

The Interscalene Block may be done pre-operatively for post op pain management. If the patient can’t lift their arm just prior to surgery, you have a pretty good idea you will not need much narcotics during the case. Some surgeons request relaxation.    
 

**LMA instead of ETT:** Sometimes I have seen and also used an LMA for shoulders. Some CRNAs prefer to use them for shoulders.  But to warn you, your entire case can be miserable if you acquire ventilation issues once the patient is prepped and draped.  Airway access is very limited when the patient is sitting up and drapes are over their head. I prefer to intubate.

**Positioning:** Beach chair or lateral decubitus. Lateral is rare. Bed rotated 45 degrees. Tape the ETT securely since your access to the airway will soon be limited.  
Keep the MAP within 20 percent of the baseline.  
Your biggest two concerns for this position are VAE and CVA.  
Have your Neo ready when you sit the patient up.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
**Neosynephrine Drip:** Yes, you must avoid hypotension. The BP naturally drops when you sit the patient up.  
IV and BP cuff are both on the non-operative arm. Try to avoid the antecubital site.    
**Duration:** 1.5-3 hours  
**EBL:**  50-100 mLs.  
**BP:** Avoid Hypotension.  
  
**NOTE:** BP at the head level could be around 25% below the cuff pressure on your monitor. Arterial pressure is reduced 0.77mmHg for every cm gradient above the heart. The vertical distance between the heart and head can be 22-90cm depending on the patient’s height. So there can be a relative difference in perfusion pressure between the brain and level of the heart. You need to keep the MAP within the 20% of the baseline.

  
**Possible Complications:**   
Infection  
Hypotension and stroke.  
Axillary nerve damage.  
Musculocutaneous nerve damage.  
Brachial Plexus nerve damage; position dependent.
