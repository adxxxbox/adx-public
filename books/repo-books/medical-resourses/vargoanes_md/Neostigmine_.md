### Neostigmine Adjuvant to Neuraxial Anesthesia

There is an abundance of literature in anesthesia obstetric books stating the enhanced effects of Neostigmine utilized in neuraxial anesthesia. Some articles discuss NO side effects.  
  
**_Neostigmine is no longer used as a neuraxial adjuvant because it causes nausea, vomiting, bradycardia, and, in higher doses, lower extremity weakness._**  
Neostigmine has not been approved by the FDA for neuraxial anesthesia and causes major nausea and GI side effects.  
  
**Intrathecal Neostigmine (literature varies)  
Intrathecal Neostigmine causes:**  
Nausea and vomiting  
Bradycardia requiring IV atropine  
Anxiety  
Agitation or restlessness  
  
**Does not effect:**  
Duration of motor blockade  
Total amount of ephedrine required  
  
**Intrathecal Doses  
**10-50 mcg  
  
**Epidural Neostigmine  
**Epidural neostigmine can also produce mild sedation for several hours.  
Epidural doses exceeding 30 mcg/kg are associated with a higher incidence of nausea and vomiting or post-operative sedation.  
  
**Method of Action  
**Muscarinic and Nicotinic cholinergic receptors are present in the dorsal horns of the spinal cord. Neostigmine prevents the breakdown of acetylcholine in the spinal cord.  
The acetylcholine then binds to muscarinic and nicotinic receptors of the spinal cord. When muscarinic receptors are stimulated, they facilitate the release of GABA in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, causing analgesia.

**Epidural neostigmine produces analgesia but also sedation in women after cesarean delivery.
