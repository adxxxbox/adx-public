### Heparin Resistance

Heparin resistance is when an unusually high amount of heparin is required to achieve a therapeutic aPTT.  
Requirement greater than 35,000 units per 24 hours |  
For a 70 kg patient = 21 units/kg/hr  
For a 100 kg patient = 15 units/kg/hrInability to maintain therapeutic ACTS with rising doses of heparin on bypass is a sign.  
  
**Possible Causes of Heparin Resistance**  
Increased heparin-binding protein levels (all of them are acute phase reactants)  
Antithrombin-III deficiency (i.e. nothing to which heparin can bind)  
Increased heparin clearance (e.g. due to splenomegaly in liver disease)  
High Factor VIII levels  
Elevation in heparin binding proteins.  
Factitious heparin resistance (e.g. failure to connect the heparin is properly to the line)  
Inappropriate delay time between blood draw and initiation of ACTs–false positive.  
  
**Labs**  
Anti-Xa is more specific than aPTT.  
  
**Possible Options  
**Consider an alternative anticoagulant such as a direct thrombin inhibitor (hirudin or argobatran) or a LMWH.  
Give cryoprecipitate and/or fresh-frozen plasma (if there is confirmed ATIII deficiency).  
Give antithrombin III concentrate.
