### Liver Disease and Anesthesia

_Refer to “Coexisting Diseases & Surgery” app for details_

Use Isoflurane, check Coags and be careful with Versed. With liver disease, there is a decrease in hepatic blood flow because of portal HTN, and hepatic flow is now more dependent on hepatic arterial flow.

The ability for Hepatic arteries to vasodilate in response to a decrease in portal vein blood flow is blunted by volatiles, especially halothane (which we rarely use). Literature tells us to limit the dose of volatiles and use Nitrous if the SaO2 permits. This will minimize the decrease in MAP.

The goal of intraoperative management with liver disease is to preserve existing hepatic function and avoid further hepatic insult, thus avoiding any decreases in hepatic blood flow. In addition, increases in splanchnic vascular resistance should be avoided, since the hepatic artery is more heavily relied upon to supply total hepatic flow. Avoid light anesthesia, hypoxia and hypercarbia.

  
Why Normocapnia?  
Normocapnia is recommended with liver disease. Respiratory alkalosis shifts ammonium ions to the less ionized ammonia, which is more diffusible across the blood brain barrier.  
Hypercapnia and acidosis have vasodilatory effects on the hepatic circulation whereas hypocapnia and alkalosis exert vasoconstricting effects.

**Drug Metabolism**:Decreased hepatic blood flow, extra-hepatic and intrahepatic blood shunting, and loss of hepatocytes decreases the ability to metabolize drugs. The bioavailability of administered medications increases, thus effectively increasing the dose.

Decreased protein synthesis decreases the percentage of drugs bound to plasma proteins and thereby increases the amount of “free” or unbound drug.

Increased hepatic clearance does not occur if hepatocytes are not capable of metabolizing the drug. However, an increase in free fractional drugs and a decrease in hepatocyte function result in an increase in free drug concentrations.

**Benzodiazepines**:

The benzodiazepine group are highly protein bound compounds, therefore a relative overdose of midazolam or diazepam can occur. In addition, there is belief that there is an increased number of benzodiazepine specific receptors that exist in patients with liver disease that can potentiate an overdose.

**Isoflurane**:  
**Isoflurane** is the optimal inhalation agent to use with liver disease. **Isoflurane** undergoes minimal biodegradation, and preserves hepatic blood flow and oxygen delivery better than Sevoflurane and Desflurane.

With Isoflurane, portal venous blood flow decreases, along with a simultaneous increase in hepatic artery blood flow, although the increase in hepatic artery blood flow does not sufficiently compensate for the decrease in portal vein flow.  

**Sevoflurane**:  
**Sevoflurane** is less likely than halothane or Enflurane to induce liver injury, and is no more toxic than either Desflurane or Isoflurane. Its metabolic products are less reactive and less injurious compared to the other volatile anesthetics. **Sevoflurane** better preserves hepatic blood flow and oxygen delivery to the liver.

**  
Nitrous Oxide**:  
Not contraindicated in patients with liver disease, yet be aware that it is imperative to maximize the oxygen delivery to hepatic tissue in advanced liver disease.  
  
Fentanyl can be used successfully in patients with liver disease despite a decreased clearance and a prolonged half-life.  
  
Morphine is the opioid that is most associated with biliary spasms.

**Opioids**:  
All opioids cause spasms of biliary smooth muscle, resulting in an increase in intrabiliary pressure. The cause of the spasm is unclear, and the spasm may have causes other than the anesthetic, such as surgical manipulation, cold irrigating solutions, and the irritant effect of contrast dye. The treatment of suspected spasms of Oddi's sphincter involves increases in the concentration of the volatile agent, or the administration of Glucagon, Nitroglycerin, Naloxone, or Nalbuphine.
