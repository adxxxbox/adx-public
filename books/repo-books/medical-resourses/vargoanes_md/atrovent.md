# Atrovent

**Atrovent (Ipratropium bromide) Aerosol**  
An Anticholinergic bronchodilator **Atrovent + Proventil = Combivent Inhaler** We rarely order this bronchodilator preoperatively because Albuterol (Proventil) is our bronchodilator of choice. Sometimes the pulmonologist orders it preoperatively. Sometimes it's alternated with Proventil treatments.

-   **Onset:** Atrovent is slower than Albuterol
-   **Potency:** Atrovent is weaker than Albuterol
-   **Duration:** Atrovent last longer than Albuterol

The cholinergic receptor subtype responsible for bronchial smooth muscle contraction is the muscarinic receptor 3 (M3). Although Atrovent blocks all five muscarinic receptor subtypes with similar affinity, it is likely that M3-receptor antagonism alone accounts for the bronchodilating effect.

The bronchodilation produced by Atrovent in asthmatic subjects develops more slowly and usually is less intense than that produced by adrenergic agonists. Some asthmatic patients may experience a useful response lasting up to 6 hours.
