# Precedex  
(Dexmedetomidine)  
Pharmacology and Notes

Infusion and Sedation Dose Range  
0.2-1.0mcg/kg/hr  

Though not FDA approved, 2mcg/kg/hr x 30 mins has been very successful for awake intubations.

Precedex is a selective alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist mostly used for the sedation of initially intubated and mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU setting. Becoming more popular in anesthesia.

**Mechanism of Action**

Binds with Pre- and postsynaptic alpha2 receptoes-causes:

Decreases norepinephrine levels.

Reduces brain noradrenergic activity.

Produces sedation.

Inhibits sympathetic activity.

Decreases blood pressure and heart rate.

Reduces Narcotic requirements. Precedex decreased norepinephrine and epinephrine levels.

Plasma norepinephrine concentrations decreased on average by 72% (range 40% to 97%).

Rapid distribution half-life (t1/2a) of about 6 minutes.

**_Metabolism_**

Dexmedetomidine undergoes almost complete biotransformation with very little unchanged dexamedetomidine excreted in urine and feces.200 mcg/2 mL (100 mcg/mL) in a glass vial. An ICU study with a mean dose per hour was 0.5 mcg/kg/hr (range: 0.1 to 6.0) and the mean duration of infusion of 15.9 hours.  
Most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions were hypotension, bradycardia, dry mouth and even A-Fib. All were rare and hypotension being the most common one precedex (dexmedetomidine hydrochloride) is not a controlled substance.

Since Precedex clearance decreases with severity of hepatic impairment, dose reduction should be considered in patients with impaired hepatic function there are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Precedex use in pregnant women.

When Precedex is infused for more than 6 hours, patients should be informed to report nervousness, agitation, and headaches that may occur for up to 48 hours.

**Renal Impairment:**Precedex pharmacokinetics were not significantly different in patients with severe renal patients. Also recommended for patients over 65 years of age and awake fiberoptic intubation patients. Precedex incompatible when administered with the following drugs: amphotericin B, diazepam.

Most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions, occurring in greater than 2% of patients in both Intensive Care Unit and Anesthesia studies include hypotension, bradycardia and dry mouth.

Precedex should be used with caution in patients who: are pregnant or are breast-feeding have a history of heart-related health problems (e.g., advanced heart block) have a history of liver disease.

Precedex should be administered by continuous infusion not to exceed 24 hours.
