ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde CholangioPancreatography)   

### ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde CholangioPancreatography)

  
_Edited by Brian Del Grosso, MS, CRNA_

For pediatrics, this is a rare case; indications and safety of ERCP in children have not been well defined. As a result, patients are generally referred to a tertiary care facility or to endoscopists who perform a high volume of procedures on adults.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is increasingly being used to evaluate pancreaticobiliary disorders in children. Refinements in procedural techniques coupled with advancements in endoscope design have improved clinical results in this population of patients.

ERCP represents the easiest and least invasive way to get directly into the bile duct. ERCP is commonly used to diagnose and treat various conditions of the liver, gallbladder, bile ducts and pancreas like bile duct stones or stenosis.  
A long endoscope is used and directed from the mouth to the duodenum. From that point, the gastroenterologist will identify the papilla of Vater (outlet of the common bile duct) and pass a catheter through it.

The gastroenterologist will inject contrast and take x-ray images to look for an obstruction. An open channel in the endoscope also allows other instruments to be passed through it to perform biopsies, remove stones, do a sphincterotomy and insert stents.  
**_With the pre-op assessment, check the patient’s cervical ROM from left to right, especially right lateral rotation. The patient’s head will be turned 90 degrees towards their right shoulder when in the prone position. Severe neck damage can be associated in patients with limited ROM._**

Many of these patients are sick and jaundiced.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT. Ask the gastroenterologist which side of the mouth to tape the ETT.

Many gastroenterologists prefer the ETT taped on the left side of the patient’s mouth. Be certain to insert the bite block before the patient goes prone.  
Rarely these cases will be done under deep MAC.

**Position:** Prone with the patient’s head to their right using a positioning wedge or pillows to elevate the right side. Arms to the side.  
**Duration:** 30 minutes to 2 hours depending how fast the doctor can locate and get into the bile duct.

**IV Access:** 22G is acceptable

**Hydration: 4:2:1 (below is just a common reference)  
**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**Arterial Line:** Not needed

**Glucagon:** Have available. Remember any opioid can cause a spasm of the Sphincter of Oddi. Morphine causes the most spasms.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Not needed.  
**Neo Drip:** Should be available and plugged into the IV distal port.  
  
**Possible Complications**  
Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) is the most frequent complication, occurring in about 3 to 5 percent of people undergoing ERCP. Many surgeons give an Indomethacin suppository in PACU.  
Infection of the bile ducts (cholangitis) is rare.  
Intestinal Perforation

Aspiration

**More Notes:**  
The Ampulla of Vater is formed by the union of the pancreatic duct and the common bile duct. The ampulla is simply the orifice located at the major duodenal papilla (where the bile is secreted). The Sphincter of Oddi is a circular band of muscle that surrounds it.

An ERCP is done using fluoroscopy, so you need a lead apron. It is a combined endoscopic and radiologic procedure. The ERCP remains the most common means of treating choledocholithiasis.

The preparation and sedation of a child undergoing ERCP is similar to that used for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The procedure should be explained to the child in a manner appropriate for the age and level of intellectual and emotional development.
