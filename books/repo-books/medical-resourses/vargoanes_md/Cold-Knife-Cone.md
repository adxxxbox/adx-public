### Cold Knife Cone

This procedure is slowly being replaced by the LEEP Procedure (loop electrosurgical excision procedure). This is a very simple and short procedure. Many are done in the doctor’s office.

A cold knife cone biopsy or conization is surgery to remove a sample of abnormal tissue from the cervix.  An abnormal change in the cells on the surface of the cervix is called cervical dysplasia.

A small cone-shaped sample of tissue is removed from the cervix. It is examined under a microscope for signs of cancer. This biopsy may also be a treatment if the doctor removes all of the diseased tissue.

**Indications**  
To detect cervical cancer or early changes that lead to cancer. Or it may be done if a test called colposcopy cannot find the cause of an abnormal Pap smear.

**Cold knife cone biopsy may also be used to treat:**  
Moderate to severe types of abnormal cell changes (called CIN II or CIN III)  
Very early stage cervical cancer (stage 0 or IA1)

**Anesthesia:** Similar to a D&C. You could do a deep MAC (room air general) or LMA, or even mask them. Remember patients with a history of OSA or an increased BMI may need to be intubated for this 10-20 minute procedure. A spinal is rare for such a short procedure.  
**Duration:** 10-30 minutes  
**IV Access:** 20 or even a 22G.  
**EBL:** minimal  
**Position:** Lithotomy, slight Trendelenburg  
  
**Possible Complications:** Bleeding

**Possible Complications**  
Bleeding  
Incompetent cervix (which may lead to premature delivery)  
Infection  
Scarring of the cervix
