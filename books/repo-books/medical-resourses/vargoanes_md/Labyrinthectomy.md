Labyrinthectomy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Labyrinthectomy

For the management of poorly compensating unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction (vertigo) in the presence of a non-functional ear. It eliminates all Meniere’s attacks. This surgery destroys the entire labyrinth, or inner ear for balance. Although the cochlea is left untouched, all the hearing is lost in this ear. A mastoidectomy is performed; the landmarks of the inner ear are identified and then removed surgically with a drill.
