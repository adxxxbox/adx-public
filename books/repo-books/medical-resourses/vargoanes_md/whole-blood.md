# Whole Blood

Rarely given anymore.  
**Volume:** 500mLs  
The blood one donates is "Whole Blood."  
It has both the plasma and the RBCs.  
Plasma is the liquid portion of the blood and is light yellow in color and makes up 55% of the volume of blood.  
RBCs make up 45% of blood, and are the red color that most people think of when they think of blood.  
**Rare Indications of Whole Blood**  
Cardiac Surgeries.  
Exchange transfusions for hemolytic diseases of newborns.  
Traumas-to counteract tremendous blood loss.  
Whole blood is rarely used to treat bleeding disorders. Since a bag of whole blood only has a small amount of clotting factors, many bags of blood would be needed to stop bleeding. There is a danger of overloading the circulatory system. Whole blood may be used if the person has lost a large amount of blood and needs to replace other blood parts such as red cells.  
If older than 24 hours platelets and clotting factors are no longer functional.
