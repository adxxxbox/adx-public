### Aquablation of the Prostate

**Also called:  
**AquaBeam  
Water-jet ablation  
  
Aquablation is a new rival of the TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) procedure.  
  
Aquablation is a surgical procedure that uses an image (map) guided, heat-free, high-pressure saline jet to precisely destroy (hydrodissect) excess prostate tissue to relieve BPH symptoms.  
**Summary of Procedure:  
**The urologic surgeon creates a surgical map of the prostate through a cystoscope so a resection can be formally planned out.  
Then, a robotically controlled, heat-free waterjet removes the prostate tissue that has been mapped out.  
This robotic technology minimizes human error in removing prostate tissue and ensures the prostate tissue is removed precisely, consistently, and predictably.  
Some surgeons may use a minimal amount of cautery following this procedure to control bleeding.  
**  
Hydrodissection:**  
The console pump applies high-velocity physiological saline under the control of the surgeon’s foot pedal.  
The saline jet is released at a right angle to the handpiece.  
Adjusting the flow rate alters the depth of penetration accordingly.  
  
**Note:**  
High-velocity water-jet technology has also been previously applied for hepatic resection and treating superficial tumors in the gastrointestinal tract.  
  
**Indication:** Benign prostatic hypertension (BPH)  
Typical candidates are those with moderate to severe LUTS (lower urinary tract symptoms) who have failed to respond to medical therapy for bladder outlet obstruction secondary to BPH.  
  
**Contraindications:**  
Active infection  
Urinary retention  
Postvoid residual volume > 400 ml  
Abnormal renal function  
Raised prostate-specific antigen level  
Current/suspected bladder/prostate cancer  
Neurogenic bladder/sphincter abnormalities  
Previous prostate surgery  
High anesthetic risk  
  
**Anesthesia management:  
General/ETT** with muscle relaxation is preferred.  
No movement is required for mapping and ablation.  
**Spinal:** Yes (an option)  
**Position:** Lithotomy  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**EBL:** Minimal  
  
**Possible side effects/complications (usually mild and temporary):  
**Pain or bleeding while urinating  
Discomfort in the pelvis  
Inability to empty the bladder  
Frequent or urgent need to urinate  
Bladder infection  
  
No significant complications (> Clavien–Dindo classification III) have been reported in human trials.
