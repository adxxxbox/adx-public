# Phentolamine

**Phentolamine Mesylate (Regetine, Oraverse)**  
Nonselective antagonists to postsynaptic Alpha 1 receptors and presynaptic alpha 2 receptors.  
Produces peripheral vasodilation and a decrease in systemic blood pressure.  
**Anesthesia Indications:** Pheochromocytosis or IV infiltration  
Prepare to use a beta blocker if cardiac arrhythmias arise.  
**Doses:**  
30-70mcg/kg IVP as needed.  
Common dose: 5mg boluses per hypertensive episode.  
1 mg for children.  
**Drip:** 5-10mcg/kg/min (titrate to effect).  
**Mixture:** 100mg in 500Ml of D5W .  
**IV Infiltratration:** 2.5-5.0 mg in 10mL syringe inject in in area of extravasation within 12 hours.  
**Onset:** < 2 minutes  
**Duration:** 10-15 minutes  
**MOA**  
Binds alpha-adrenergic receptors and interfere with the ability of catecholamines or other sympathomimentics to provoke alpha responses. Prevents the effects of catecholamines and sympathomimetics on the heart and peripheral vasculature.  
It also inhibits epinephrine from preventing the release of Insulin  
**Metabolism:** Hepatic  
13% of a single IV dose appears unchanged in the urine.  
**Contraindications:**  
Hypersensitivity to phentolamine or mannitol (contains mannitol).  
History of MI.  
Coronary insufficiency  
Angina, or other evidence suggestive of CAD.  
**Phentolamine Vial**  
Each vial contains Phentolamine mesylate USP, 5 mg and mannitol USP, 25 mg in sterile, lyophilized form.  
**For diagnosis of pheochromocytoma:**  
Inject 5mg IV rapidly. Record BP immediately after injection, at 30-sec intervals for first 3 min, and at 60-sec intervals for the next 7 min.  
**Other Uses for Phentolamine**  
Control of hypertensive crises secondary to MAOI sympathomimetic amine interactions or withdrawal of Clonidine, Propranolol, or other antihypertensives; in conjunction with Papaverine as intracavernous injection for impotence.  
**Reversal agent for dental intraoral local anesthesia**  
Accelerates the reversal of lingering soft tissue anesthesia associated with local anesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor. Patients can recover full lip sensation in about half the time  
**Other Notes:**  
Always have an A-line. If you have access to a Swan-Ganz-keep PCWP 15-20mmHg.  
**Pheochromocytoma** patients become extremely vasoconstricted from the excess adrenaline and thus are INTRAVASCULARLY VOLUME DEPLETED; thus the aim is to also infuse fluid in to maintain a PCWP 15-20mmHg.  
The surgeon's slightest touch of the tumor-can cause a massive release of adrenalin sky rocketing the BP. Once the vessels are ligated, you can D/C the phentolamine drip.
