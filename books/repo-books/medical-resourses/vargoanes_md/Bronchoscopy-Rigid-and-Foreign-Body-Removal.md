Bronchoscopy-Rigid- Foreign Body Removal (airway)   

### Bronchoscopy-Rigid- Foreign Body Removal (airway)

  
_John Martin Kramer, CRNA, Novant Health, Charlotte, NC_

**Indications of the procedure:** This procedure is indicated when there is the presumption of a foreign body in the upper or lower airway of the child.

Communication with the surgeon is very important before and during the procedure.  
**  
MOST of the surgeons will want you to:**  
NOT intubate the patient.  
Rotate the OR table 90 degrees towards the surgeon.  
Hand the surgeon the end of the ventilator circuit to connect to the Rigid scope.  
Maintain spontaneous respirations  
Avoid administering positive pressure breaths  
Avoid bucking and coughing  
Avoid desaturations  
  
**Literature States:** You want to maintain spontaneous respirations and avoid giving any positive pressure breaths because the positive breaths could cause the foreign body to move more distally down the airway. At the same time, you are expected to keep the patient deep enough to remain motionless during the stimulating prolonged direct rigid laryngoscopy.

**In reality:** There is a fine line between keeping a patient deep enough during a rigid bronchoscopy, while avoiding apnea and maintaining spontaneous respirations.

There are many times you will need to manually ventilate the patient during apneic episodes. Most of the time, the foreign body has already lodged and settled in a position to where it won’t advance from administering positive pressure breaths.

**What most surgeons do:**  
The surgeons usually use a rigid bronchoscope and insert a long skinny Optic Forcep through the Rigid Scope (through the cords) to remove the foreign body. The optic forcep can actually be advanced into the right mainstem by the surgeon simply by turning the patient’s head to the left.

**Jet Ventilator:** Very rare. Some literature states to avoid jet ventilation due to the risk of barotauma and pneumothorax.

**Short summary of the surgical procedure**: Any child who arrives at the emergency room with a presumptive diagnosis of foreign body aspiration requires immediate emergency therapy. Often times agitation by a child may be misinterpreted as being emotionally upset when in fact it is due to the underlying hypoxemia.  
If the child presents with cyanosis, agitation, tachypnea, and tachycardia the child should be taken to the operating room immediately for removal of the foreign body with a rigid bronchoscope.

However, if the child presents in a stable state they radiographic studies can be performed to localize the foreign body. In the event that a peanut has been aspirated, rigid bronchoscopy should be performed immediately as the oil released from the peanut can have detrimental effects on the lung tissue leading to complete obstruction and atelectasis.

**_Peanuts and many other foreign bodies may not show up on an x-ray etc., but the collapsed portion of the lung distal to the obstruction can pinpoint an anatomical location.

The rigid bronchoscope is a rigid, straight, hollow metal tube that is available in several sizes. Its purpose is to provide access to the trachea and the mainstem bronchi.  
**Pre-op and what to prepare. What you need to find out?**  
Is there cardiac issues or other defects?  
Does the patient already have an IV?  
Can give midazolam to patient either 0.5-0.7 mg/kg PO or 0.5-2 mg IV  
Assess the child’s teeth to ensure there are no loose teeth that may be dislodged.

The surgeon should use a bite block.  
The important thing to remember is you do not want to give too much premedication to a patient who may already have a compromised airway and may be hypoxic.

**Room set up:**  
Correct size ETTs  
Teeth guard  
Oral airway  
Accordion/flexible adaptor-to connect to the Rigid scope  
Atropine or Robinul  
Succinylcholine  
Propofol syringes and extension tubing (connect to closest port to the patient)  
Suction tubing and catheter

**Goal:** Maintain spontaneous ventilation with an unconscious patient who does not cough or buck during the rigid bronchoscopy.

**Local (airway) Anesthesia:** Either a lidocaine nebulizer treatment, Cetacaine spray or an airway block prior to direct laryngoscopy is important. Most surgeons will spay the vocal cords with lidocaine upon laryngoscopy.

**Anesthetic** : General with spontaneous ventilation. Ask the surgeon about intubation. There are still some surgeons who prefer an intubated patient and they can pull out and reinsert the ETT as needed.  
  
**Nitrous Oxide:** No, it can cause air trapping distal to the obstruction.  
Most of the time: DO NOT INTUBATE. After the bed is immediately rotated towards the surgeon, he/she will insert his rigid scope and spray the vocal cords with lidocaine.

**Induction:** IV (if already present) or inhalation.

**Spontaneous ventilation:** Yes, try avoid apnea and positive pressure ventilation. Don’t be surprised if you have to give multiple slow breaths. Slow gentle breaths are preferred.  
**Propofol intermittent doses**

Small intermittent doses of propofol (10-20mg) as needed with extension tubing connected to the port closest to the patient is popular. Be careful with your small boluses, you want to maintain spontaneous respirations.

**Inhalation Agent:** Sevoflurane and run it very high. A lot of the agent is lost around the oral cavity due to the open shared airway with the surgeon.

**Intubation** : Usually as last resort if absolutely needed. If you are unable to ventilate or oxygenate along with marked desaturations, you will need to intubate. High FIO2 with PEEP usually brings the SaO2 back up.

**Ventilation Port:** Oxygenation and inhalation agent delivery is initiated via the side port of the rigid bronchoscope. Hand the ventilator tubing (using your flexible accordion/flexible adaptor) to the surgeon.  
Unfortunately, there is always a leak. It is important to use high flow oxygen as well as high concentrations of you volatile anesthetic as this is not a closed airway and you will lose a lot to the surrounding air.  
As mentioned several times, AVOID any positive pressure ventilations because the positive pressure can force the foreign body more distally down the trachea. Try to maintain spontaneous respirations with assisted ventilation.

**Steroids:** Yes, to decrease airway swelling

**Airway issues:** foreign body so airway may be completely obstructed.

**Positioning**  
Supine, arms to the side, shoulder roll.  
Shortly after induction, the bed will immediately be rotated 90 degrees towards the surgeon. Make sure the patient is very deep before the bed is rotated because during the transition, the patient is not receiving any inhalation agent and could quickly become light.

Make sure you have the anesthesia circuit tubing fully extended and your ventilator tubing holder is out of the surgeon’s field. It helps to have all your lines already isolated to the proper side prior to induction so you are not scrambling to relocate them creating slack the last second while rotating the bed after induction.

**TIVA (another method you can use)  
****Propofol** infusion at 125-300 mcg/kg/min. with or without the addition of **Remifentanil** at 0.15-0.40 mcg/kg/min.

  
**Limit Hypertension and Tachycardia:**  

BP and HR often fluctuate strikingly during direct laryngoscopy. Deepen the anesthesia while maintaining spontaneous ventilation. Be careful with narcotics because these can be quick cases. Turn your Sevoflurane up if the surgeon does not mind and slowly increase your propofol infusion as needed.  
**Mouth guard or gauze pads:** yes, the teeth need to be protected.  
  
**Antisialagogue:** Yes, Robinul of 0.1-0.2mg IV pre-emergence or 0.2-0.3mg IM 1h pre-op. To dry the secretions

**Decadron:** Yes, 4-12mg. Repeated attempts of rigid bronchoscopy can cause cord edema.

**Duration:** 10-30 minutes  

**Desaturations:** Inform the surgeon when the SaO2 is dropping. He could remove the rigid scope and mask ventilate. Offer the oral airway from your tabletop if needed. Communicate with the surgeon.  
  
**Monitor Volume:** Make sure the volume tone of the pulse oximetry is loud enough to alert the surgeon of desaturations.  
  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Not normally used.**Duration:** 20-30 min  
**EBL:** min  
**Possible complications:**  
Laryngeal edema  
Vocal cord injury
