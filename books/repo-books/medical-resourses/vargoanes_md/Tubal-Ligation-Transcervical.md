Tubal Ligation – Transcervical     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Tubal Ligation – Transcervical

These procedures are usually done in a doctor’s office. Sometimes we see them come to the hospital OR. Most have a co-morbidity, are demanding of a general anesthetic, or are morbidly obese.    
**Anesthetic:** General/LMA. The patient might be placed in a slight Trendelenburg position, which may increase aspiration risks with an LMA. My personal policy is if the patient is over 200+ pounds, she gets an ETT. I have no scientific evidence for that but I have practiced over 20 years and I have formulated my policies during that time.  
**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**Position:** Lithotomy; ask the surgeon ahead of time if slight Trendelenburg is desired.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
**EBL**: Minimal

**Possible Complications**  
Bleeding  
Infection  
Damage to the bowel, bladder or major blood vessels.  
Prolonged pelvic or abdominal pain.  
  
**Some Notes and Facts**  
The procedure is 99% effective in the first year. However, fallopian tubes can, in some cases, reform or reconnect. Of those failures, 15-20% are likely to be ectopic. 84% of those failures occurred a year or more after sterilization.

According to one study, approximately 5% of women who have had tubal ligation will have a failure due to ectopic pregnancy.
