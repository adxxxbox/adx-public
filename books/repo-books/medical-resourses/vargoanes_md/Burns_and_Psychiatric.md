### Burns and Psychiatric

Psychiatric disorders are common among burn patients.

One study showed that more than 50% of burn survivors had psychiatric disorders 10 years after the injury. The most common disorder was posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Chronic pain predisposes neurologic problems and mobility issues that can persist, making return to school, work, and life difficult.

Most pediatric patients are anxious preoperatively and we usually administer versed preoperatively as long as there are no contraindications.

Inadequate control of pain and anxiety can result in suboptimal psychiatric outcomes.
