# Nipride

**Nipride (Nitroprusside)**  
**Class:** Arteriolar and veno vasodilator via Nitric Oxide group donor.  
In anesthesia, we mostly just use it for cases to avoid or reverse sudden periods of hypertension - cerebral aneurysms. Not as popular in anesthesia as it once was, maybe due to potential cyanide toxicity.  
Mix 50 mg in 250 ml in NSS or D5W (200mcg/mL).  
Mix 100mg in 250ml in NSS or D5W (400mcg/mL).  
Continuous BP monitoring per A-line.  
(manufacturer states to just mix with D5W).  
  
**Doses:**  
0.25 - 5mcg/kg/min (some literature has up to 8mcg/kg/min).  
  
**Popular:** Initially 0.3mcg/kg/min = 6mL/hr for a 70kg pt (200mcg/ml strength).  
**Emergency Syringe:** Dilute 1mL in 5mL syringe=40mcg/mL  
Doses > 3mcg/kg/min > 72 hours may cause thiocynate toxicity, cyanide toxicity.  
At the high end range, infusion should never last more than 10 minutes.  
If BP is not controlled after 10 minutes, stop the infusion.  
  
A very potent antihypertensive that we have to closely monitor while using because it is so rapidly potent and can cause cyanide toxicity.  
Cardine has been replacing it in the ICUs.  
Vasodilates venous and arteriolar smooth muscle by generation of nitric oxide.  
  
**Onset:** Rapid  
**Use:** Hypertension, afterload reduction.  
**Mechanism:** Direct venous and arteriolar dilation.  
**Elimination:** Metabolized to cyanide and then to thiocyanate, which in turn is excreted by the kidney.  
**Precautions:** Monitor cyanide levels, especially in the setting of renal failure.  
  
**Cyanide Toxicity:** Metabolized to cyanide and then to thiocyanate, which in turn is excreted by the kidney.  
Cyanide levels should be checked every 24 hours.  
  
**Treatment:**  
D/C Nipride  
100% O2  
Administer hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit) or the Cyanide antidote kit.  
**Hydroxocobalamin** combines with cyanide to form cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12), which is renally cleared.  
  
**Cyanide Antidote Kit:**  
Has specific directions is available from Eli Lilly Canada Inc. Contains amyl nitrite pearls, sodium nitrite, and sodium thiosulfate. Amyl and sodium nitrites induce methemoglobin in red blood cells, which combines with cyanide, thus releasing cytochrome oxidase enzyme. Inhaling crushed amyl nitrite pearls is a temporizing measure before IV administration of sodium nitrite.  
Sodium thiosulfate enhances the conversion of cyanide to thiocyanate , which is renally excreted. Thiosulfate has a somewhat delayed effect and thus is typically used with sodium nitrite for faster antidote action.  
  
**Other Notes:**  
Risk of severe hypotension in patients who are intravascularly dry. Overcomes hypoxic vasoconstriction in the lungs, so initiation can cause increased V/Q mismatch and therefore more difficulty in oxygenation.  
Measure Thiocynate levels daily - do not exceed 100 mg/L.  
Peritoneal dialysis can be helpful to reduce high levels of thiocyanate.  
High rates of Nipride can be fatal.  
ABG's displaying metabolic acidosis is evidence of cyanide toxicity.
