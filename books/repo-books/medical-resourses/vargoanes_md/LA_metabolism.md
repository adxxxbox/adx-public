### Local Anesthetics and Metabolism

**Esters local anesthetics:**  
Are RAPIDLY hydrolyzed (except Tetracaine) in the plasma by the enzyme Pseudocholinesterase.  
Cocaine, an ester, is an exception, as it is metabolized predominantly by the liver.  
The rapid hydrolysis of Esters (except Tetracaine) decreases the risk of maternal toxicity and maternal drug transfer.  
After metabolism, the byproduct of Esters is PABA.  
Tetracaine (also an ester) is hydrolyzed the slowest which makes it 16 times more toxic than Chloroprocaine which is hydrolyzed the fastest.

**Amides local anesthetics:** Are metabolized by liver microsomal enzymes in the liver (cytochrome P450) through N-dealkylation & subsequent hydrolysis and excreted in the urine.  
Patients with significant liver disease or CHF who have poor hepatic blood flow will have trouble metabolizing amides and other agents. The major metabolite is PPX.  
Avoid Amide local anesthetics with impaired liver patients.

Half-life of **amide** local anesthetics are generally longer, thus a longer duration.  
Unfortunately, the toxicity is much greater due to their longer duration.  
Metabolism byproducts of amide local anesthetics can possess clinical activity if allowed to accumulate in the blood.  
All local anesthetics have the ability to cause sedation

**The rate of hydrolysis is related to the degree of toxicity**  
The slower the metabolism (hydrolization), the higher risk of toxicity.  
Meaning that the local anesthetic is still circulating in the blood and can accumulate to toxic levels.
