### Aortic Stenosis (AS) Overview

**AS can occur at 3 levels:**  
Valvular  
Subvalvular  
Supravalvular  
  
**3 Main Causes of AS**  
Calcification and fibrosis of normal tri-leaflet aortic valve.  
Calcification and fibrosis of a congenitally bicuspid AV.  
Rheumatic fever, usually also involves the mitral valve.

Aortic Stenosis is a fixed outlet obstruction to left ventricular ejection. This results in increasing LV pressure to maintain forward flow. This obstruction is usually gradual and the ventricle has time to compensate and maintain SV.

Aortic stenosis usually has an asymptomatic latent period of 10-20 years. During this time, the LV outflow obstruction and the pressure load on the myocardium gradually increases. Symptoms develop gradually over time. Aortic stenosis is the most common cause of LV outflow obstruction.

**Aortic Stenosis Effect on Cardiac Anatomy**

**Left ventricle:** Concentric Hypertrophy  
**Concentric Hypertrophy:** This is a compensatory mechanism to reduce LV wall stress.  
The LV becomes thickened due to increased afterload, which has the dual effects of increasing myocardial demand and reducing ventricular compliance (thus, sinus rhythm and atrial kick are CRITICAL, providing 30-40% of LVEDV).

Left ventricular hypertrophy causes reduced diastolic compliance, impaired coronary blood flow and imbalance of myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Increased systolic pressures further increase demand. Early in the disease, LVEDP will increase, leading to pulmonary symptoms, although LVEDV or preload does not increase until late in the disease.

Myocardial contractility deteriorates over time, further compromising left ventricular function.     
  
**External chest compressions are essentially useless!** Always have a defibrillator available 

**Symptoms**  
DOE: Angina is typically precipitated by exertion and relieved by rest. Thus, it may resemble angina from coronary artery disease.  
Orthostatic or exertional syncope: Syncope often occurs upon exertion when systemic vasodilatation in the presence of a fixed forward stroke volume causes the arterial systolic blood pressure to decline. It also may be caused by atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Syncope at rest may be due to transient ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or atrioventricular block,  if calcification of the valve extends into the conduction system. Another cause of syncope is abnormal vasodepressor reflexes due to increased LV intracavitary pressure (vasodepressor syncope).

Syncope may be accompanied by convulsions.

Patients with aortic stenosis may have a higher incidence of nitroglycerin-induced syncope than occurs in the general population. Always consider aortic stenosis as a possible etiology for a patient who demonstrates particular hemodynamic sensitivity to nitrates.

**Pulsus alternans:** This can occur in the presence of LV systolic dysfunction. The jugular venous pulse may show prominent **α** waves reflecting reduced right ventricular compliance leading to hypertrophy of the interventricular septum.

Sı is usually normal or soft. The aortic component of the second heart sound, A2, is usually diminished or absent, because the aortic valve is calcified and immobile and/or the aortic ejection is prolonged and it is obscured by the prolonged systolic ejection murmur. The presence of a normal or accentuated A2 speaks against the presence of severe aortic stenosis.

Paradoxical splitting of the S2 also occurs, resulting from late closure of A2. P2 may also be accentuated in the presence of secondary pulmonary hypertension.

An ejection click is common in children and young adults with congenital aortic stenosis, but it is rare in elderly individuals with acquired calcific aortic stenosis, in whom the cusps become immobile and severely calcified. This sound occurs approximately 40-60 milliseconds after the onset of S1 and is frequently heard best along the mid to lower left sternal border; it is often well transmitted to the apex and may be confused with a split S1.

A prominent S4 can be present and is due to forceful atrial contraction into a hypertrophied left ventricle. The presence of an S4 in a young patient with aortic stenosis indicates significant aortic stenosis, but with aortic stenosis in an elderly person, this is not necessarily true.

In elderly persons with calcific aortic stenosis, the murmur may be more prominent at the apex, because of radiation of its high-frequency components (Gallavardin phenomenon). This may lead to its misinterpretation as a murmur of mitral regurgitation. Accentuation of the aortic stenosis murmur following a long R-R interval (as in atrial fibrillation or following a premature beat) distinguishes it from the mitral regurgitation murmur, which usually does not change.
