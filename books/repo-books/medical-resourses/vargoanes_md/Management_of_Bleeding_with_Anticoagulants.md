Management of Bleeding with Anticoagulants    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Management of Bleeding with Anticoagulants

**Discontinue anticoagulant and find out the half-life.**  
Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) have shorter half-lives of 5-17 hours.  
If the patient is on a DOAC may not need reversed if it is NON-urgent.  
  
**Severe bleed or non-elective major surgery is needed**  
Anticoagulation reversal strategies must be implemented.  
1\. Control active bleeding.  
2\. Maintain adequate fluid, oxygen and hemodynamic support.  
3\. Transfuse packed red blood or initiate massive transfusion protocols, if necessary.  
4\. Consider platelets in patients who are thrombocytopenic or on anti-platelet therapy:

-   aspirin (ASA)
-   clopidogrel (Plavix)
-   prasugrel (Effient)
-   dipyridamole (Persantine)
-   ticlopidine (Ticlid)

  
Consider Kcentra or FEIBA if necessary.  
  
**Lab Work**  
**Order routine lab tests:  
**CBC

LFT  
DIC Panel  
  
Order coagulation testing. (Utility of testing based on anticoagulant is discussed below.)
