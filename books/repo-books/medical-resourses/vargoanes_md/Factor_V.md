### Factor V (Proaccelerin, Labile Factor)

**Factor V Leiden thrombophilia** – an inherited mutation of factor V: see details below.  
  
**Factor V  
**It is enzymatically inactive and acts as a cofactor FXa.  
  
When Factor V is activated (FVa) it is a co-factor of factor Xa with which it forms prothrombinase complex, which enhances the activation of prothrombin to thrombin.  
**Note:** Factor Xa requires the presence of calcium ions and an appropriate phospholipid (PL) membrane surface to enhance the activation of prothrombin to thrombin.  
  
**Pathway:** It is both intrinsic and extrinsic (common pathway).  
Deficiency leads to predisposition for hemorrhage.  
Some mutations (most notably factor V Leiden) predispose to thrombosis, which may lead to myocardial infarction and deep vein thrombosis.  
  
**Source:** Liver  
Also released from platelets.  
Deficiency will prolong PT, PTT and INR.  
  
**Associated genetic disorders  
**Activated protein C resistance.  
_The gene for factor V is located on the first chromosome (1q21-q25)._  
  
**More Notes:  
**Factor V is an extremely labile globulin protein.  
It deteriorates rapidly with a half–life around 16 hours.  
It is consumed in the clotting process and is essential in the later stages of thromboplastin formation.  
  
**Factor V Leiden thrombophilia**  
Factor V Leiden is the name of a specific gene mutation in the _F5_ gene.  
  
People with factor V Leiden thrombophilia have a higher risk for blood clots. However, the severity of factor V Leiden thrombophilia varies greatly from person to person. It is estimated that 95% of people with one factor V Leiden mutation never develop a clot. For those that do, their first clot usually occurs after age 30.  
  
The most common type of blood clots associated with factor V Leiden thrombophilia, are DVTs and or PE.  
  
The clotting action of Factor V is controlled by another protein called Activated Protein C. To stop blood from forming clots, activated protein C easily turns off Factor V.  
  
Activated protein C does not work as well on the abnormal Factor V Leiden protein. Factor V Leiden resists the effects of activated protein C, so it takes longer to turn off factor V Leiden. As a result, clotting goes on longer than usual. This is why factor V Leiden is sometimes called activated protein C resistance and why people with this mutation clot more than those without it.  
  
It is estimated that about 5% (1 out of 20) of Caucasians have factor V Leiden.  
  
It is more common in individuals of European ancestry.  
  
In the United States, approximately 1-2% (1 in 100 to 1 in 50) of African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Native Americans also have the mutation.  
  
Factor V Leiden is rare in Asians.
