The Epidural Test Dose: A Review

The incidence of catheter or needle subdural misplacement is < 1%.  
**False Negative Test Dose with a an Epidural Inserted in the Subdural Space**Moore and Batra proved the possibility of a **False Negative Test Dose** using 45mg of lidocaine with 15mcg of epinephrine when an epidural catheter is unintentionally inserted in the subdural space. A catheter inserted within the subdural space may also have zero aspiration of CSF resulting in a “False Negative” test dose. However, the test dose is still important because getting a high block with a test dose still indicates a subdural or subarachnoid injection.  
  
The subdural space is a potential space found between the dura and arachnoid mater.  
It contains a small amount of serous fluid and extends intracranially. There is no way that an epidural catheter alone can penetrate an intact dura mater.  
However, the epidural needle may partly pierce the dura mater in up to 7% of the patients.  
The arachnoid mater may then be separated from the dura mater during the insertion of an epidural catheter. A standard bolus may then rupture the arachnoid mater and bathe in the CSF becoming a subarachnoid block.  
  
**Possible Symptoms of a Subdural Catheter Insertion**  
A high but slow spreading epidural block  
Patchy sensory loss  
Sacral area may be spared  
Only mild hypotension - NOT profound  
  
Upon diagnosis, you will need to immediately remove the epidural catheter.  
  
**More Notes  
**Local anesthetics can travel higher in the subdural space than in the epidural space.  
The small dose of local anesthetic, associated with a spinal anesthetic, may result in a failed spinal.  
  
Larger doses, associated with epidural analgesia, may result in Horner’s syndrome.
