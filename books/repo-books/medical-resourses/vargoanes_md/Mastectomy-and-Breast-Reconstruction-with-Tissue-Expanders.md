### Mastectomy and Breast Reconstruction with Tissue Expanders

It is now common to combine the mastectomy with breast reconstruction in the same case. In pre-op, don’t sedate the patient until the plastic surgeon has arrived and marked the patient. Sometimes the plastic surgeon has already marked the breasts the day before, so it may not be an issue. Make sure both consents are complete.  
**Anesthetic**: General/ETT  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Not for the mastectomy. The plastic surgeon usually will ask for relaxation for his part.  
**Breast Reconstruction:** Usually  
**Position:** Supine with arms out.  
**BP cuff**: Opposite of the involved Axillary Node.  
**Duration**: 3.5 -7 hours total  
1-2 hours for the Mastectomy.  
2.5-4 hours for the breast reconstruction; depends on the plastic surgeon.  
**IV Access**: 20G is acceptable. Place the IV on the opposite side of the involved Axillary Node. It’s OK to place an IV in the foot if bilateral nodes are involved.  
**EBL**: 1-200mLs  
**Antibiotics:** Ancef, if not contraindicated: Remember, Ancef is redosed Q4h.

**Emergence**: Besides the cancer, most of these patients are healthy with a pretty good airway. Deep extubations are common.

The general surgeon will leave the incisions open for the plastic surgeon to do his part.  
The plastic surgeon usually does not need to sit the patient up for unilateral comparison like they do with implants. So the patient’s arms do not need to be double strapped.
