### IPACK Block History

First described by Dr. Sanjay K Sinha in Hartford, CT, USA, as an alternative analgesic supplement to the femoral or adductor canal blocks to cover the **posterior** knee pain.  
  
**IPACK stands for:**  
**I**nfiltration between  
**P**opliteal  
**A**rtery and  
**C**apsule of the  
**K**nee  
  
**Why the IPACK block was invented:**  
After total knee arthroplasty (TKA), there was still a need for a peripheral block to relieve posterior knee pain that did not hinder early ambulation.  
It was found that by blocking the small branches of the common peroneal and tibial nerve in an area between the popliteal artery, vein, and the posterior knee capsule (IPACK space), a motor-free block can be achieved in the posterior knee area.
