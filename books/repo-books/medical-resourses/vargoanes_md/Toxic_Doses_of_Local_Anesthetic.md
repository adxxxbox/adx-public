Toxic doses of local anesthetic can happen with catheter migration after an initial negative test dose.  
  
Seizure and cardiovascular collapse may be seen with toxic doses of lidocaine or chloroprocaine. Be prepared to treat seizure activity.  
  
Benzodiazepines are the treatment of choice and small doses of propofol may be beneficial, but consider the risk of potentiating cardiovascular collapse.  
  
Be prepared to maintain the patient’s airway and oxygenation.  
  
Consider endotracheal intubation with succinylcholine and cricoid pressure.  
  
With severe reactions, cardiovascular support may be needed.  
  
Consider intravascular fluids and vasopressors such as dopamine.
