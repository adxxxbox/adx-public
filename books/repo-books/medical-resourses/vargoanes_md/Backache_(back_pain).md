Up to 30% of patients that undergo general anesthesia will complain of a backache. A large number of patients suffer from chronic back pain. This is generally not a contraindication to neuraxial techniques. The patient should be aware that spinal or epidural anesthesia may result in some discomfort. Any time a needle goes through anatomical structures, there is an inflammatory response. This may result in spasms and is generally short lived. Use of ice and anti-inflammatory medications will help. Symptoms may continue for up to a few weeks.  
  
Though backaches are common, they should not be dismissed. Back pain is an early sign of serious complications such as epidural/spinal hematoma and abscess formation.  
  
Careful investigation of the symptoms will help you determine if it is a benign complication or a symptom of a more serious problem. Local tenderness at the site of the epidural placement is common.Postpartum back pain is common in parturients and is thought to be related to hormonal changes, lordosis that is associated with pregnancy, ligament softening, and maternal weight gain.If treatment is needed, patients may use alternating warm/cold compresses and treat with oral analgesics.
