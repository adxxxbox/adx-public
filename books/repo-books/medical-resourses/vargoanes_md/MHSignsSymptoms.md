### Signs and Symptoms of Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) in the Operating Room

  
_Edited by Dan Lovinaria DNP, MS, MBA, APRN, CRNA_

**Rigidity**: NON-transient after induction with masseter (jaw) muscle rigidity (MMR) or generalized after induction with succinylcholine. This is often overlooked because mild or transient MMR can occur after receiving Sevoflurane and Succinylcholine without any occurrence of MH.  
The peripheral muscle rigidity (contracture) may also occur downstream.  
So assess the most accessible extremity- does it feel rigid?  
  
**Tachycardia and hypertension** (90-130 bpm is common)  
Often overlooked and mistaken for either insufficient anesthesia or Desflurane induced.  
Due to the hypermetabolic state and sympathetic catecholamine surge  
that causes increased temperature, oxygen consumption, and acidosis.  
Bradycardia may eventually follow the tachycardia with heart failure from hyperkalemic heart failure.

**Tachypnea and Increased Minute Ventilation  
**Often overlooked because the patient is paralyzed  
Tachypnea is a compensatory mechanism to the massive increase in PaCO2 and acidosis.  
  
**Increase in ETCO2 (Hypercapnea)  
**_The most sensitive early indicator for MH is an increased ETCO2 not responding to increased minute ventilation._  
A rise in ETCO2 may be delayed for up to 15 minutes after MMR, but will occur if trigger agents are continued.  
Arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) may exceed 100 mmHg  
  
**CO2 absorbent becomes hot and blue**  
CO2 absorbent has been rapidly used up  
  
**Skin mottling  
**Skin becomes mottled and/or cyanotic.

**Ventricular dysrhythmias  
**From hyperkalemia

**Hyperthermia (may exceed 43C from increased cellular metabolism)  
**Almost always occurs after the MMR, The hypermetabolic increases body temperature at a very fast rate of 1°-2° C every five minutes and may exceed 43 C. Sometimes this later symptom is the deciding factor to start treating the MH.

**Cola-colored urine (myoglobinuria)**A result of the overall skeletal muscle cell breakdown and the release of the myoglobin from the interior of the muscle cell into central circulation

**DIC** (will occur if not treated appropriately)Will result in bleeding from multiple sites

**Laboratory Findings Common with an MH Crises  
In venous or arterial blood gas:  
**Metabolic and Respiratory Acidosis  
Elevated Lactate levels by 10-15 fold  
Hyperkalemia: >6.0mEq/L  
HyperCKemia (↑ CK) sometimes a late finding-> 20,000 U/L  
↑ Serum myoglobin: > 170 mcg/L  
↑ Urine Myoglobin  
Abnormal coagulation tests-may result if MH is left untreated  
↑ Elevated aldolase

**Arterial Blood Gas:**  
pH: < 7.25  
PaCO2: 60-100mmHg  
BE: < - 8 mEq/L

**More on Masseter Muscle Rigidity (MMR) after Induction  
(Why it can be overlooked)  
**_Muscular rigidity, especially in the jaw, is often the first sign of MH._Brief rigidity (< 20-30 seconds) is a normal response to succinylcholine.  
Mild or transient MMR can occur after receiving Sevoflurane and Succinycholine without any occurrence of MH.Generalized rigidity with MMR may not be present with MH.  
  
All patients who develop succinylcholine-induced MMR will experience rhabdomyolysis over the ensuing 24 hours_  
  
Rigidity lasting longer than 1 minute is abnormal. 20-50% of these patients will develop MH within the next hour if they received succinylcholine and his/her jaw cannot be opened or the patient has peripheral muscle rigidity._  
  
When succinylcholine-induced MMR occurs, elective surgery should be postponed. If the procedure is emergent, the anesthetic may continue with nontrigger agents.  
  
These patients should remain in the hospital and be monitored for signs of rhabdomyolysis such as myoglobinuria and myoglobinemia.  
  
CK levels and electrolytes should be checked every 8 hours until returning to normal.  
  
Patients who experience milder increases in jaw tension should be observed for signs and symptoms of MH for at least 12 hours.

If there is evidence of myoglobinuria, dark cola-colored urine, increase in temperature, pulse rate, and abnormality of acid base balance, the patient should be admitted and observed overnight.

The association of malignant hyperthermia and unusual disease: when you're hot you're hot or maybe not.
