Carpal Tunnel Release     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Carpal Tunnel Release

  
This surgery involves cutting the transverse carpal ligament to relieve pressure on the median nerve in the wrist.  
  
**Anesthetic:** MAC with or w/o a Regional.  
**If not using regional:** Give Propofol prior to local injection with enough sedation to tolerate tourniquet pain.  
**With Regional:** Enough sedation to tolerate tourniquet pain.  
**Regional:** Usually a Bier Block, sometimes an Axillary or Supraclavicular block.

With a Bier Block, the patient will still have tourniquet pain.  
Axillary or Supraclavicular block: No tourniquet pain.

An experienced surgeon only requires 10 minutes for tourniquet time; so tourniquet pain may not be an issue. Chart expediently because these can be fast cases.  
**Duration:** 10-40 minutes

**Position:** Supine and arms out  
**EBL:** none  
**IV Access**: 20G is acceptable on the opposite extremity.  
22G on operative hand (if using a bier block).  
  
**Possible Complications:**  
Tendon or nerve laceration.  
Reflex sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD).  
Minor bleeding.  
Infection  
Numbness around the incision.  
Wrist stiffness.  
Persistent swelling.  
Painful or abnormal scar formation.  
Damage to median nerve.

   
**About Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**  
The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway located on the palm side of your wrist. This tunnel protects a main nerve to your hand and nine tendons that bend your fingers. Compression of the nerve produces the numbness, pain and, eventually, hand weakness that characterize carpal tunnel syndrome.  
  
**SURGERY:** The surgeon makes a small incision and widens the carpal tunnel. Surgery consists of releasing the ligament that forms the tight roof of the carpal tunnel. This opens and widens the carpal tunnel allowing plenty of room for everything in it and relieving pressure on the nerve.

**Endoscopic Method:** A technique that only requires a small incision at the wrist (single-portal technique) or at the wrist and palm (two-portal technique). There is much less tissue damage and a splint is usually not required post procedure. The scars heal more quickly; incision is smaller and tends to be less painful at 3 months after surgery. 

Some surgeons request a Bier block for endoscopic method, because the volume from the local injection could distort the endoscopic view.

The endoscopic method is better for healing since there is no hand incision. An experienced surgeon does it just as quick as a non-endoscopic technique.
