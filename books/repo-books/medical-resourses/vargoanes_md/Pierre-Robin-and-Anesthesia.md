**Short Story:**  
**_With Pierre Robin, prepare for a difficult airway, until proven otherwise._**

Ketamine and Precedex are common cocktails for pediatric awake intubations.

**Induction/Intubation:**  
Consider an awake fiberoptic intubation with a LMA as back up. You should also have extra anesthesia hands and all the necessary equipment available.

**Intro:**  
The neonatal or fetal diagnosis of Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS) is made when three craniofacial anomalies occur together in sequence during fetal development:  
**Micrognathia** —or small lower jaw  
**Glossoptosis** —where the tongue “balls up” towards the back of the mouth  
**Cleft or horseshoe shaped palate**  
  
**These abnormalities may lead to:**  
Difficulties in feeding and swallowing  
Respiratory compromise or problems  
Frequent ear infections- possibly reduced hearing.

In the worst cases, chronic airway obstruction can lead to cor pulmonale and central apnea.  
Some of these kids easily obstruct just in the supine position and are very difficult to oxygenate and/or mask ventilate.

_Fortunately for us, most Pierre Robin patients have natural airway improvement with time._  
**  
Possible Associations with PRS**  
Sticklers syndrome-40%  
Velocardiofacial (DiGeorge) syndrome 15%  
Fetal alcohol syndrome  
Treacher-Collins Syndrome

**Possible surgeries with PRS**  
Repair a cleft palate to reduce ear infection.  
Correct micrognathia that does not improve with natural growth and development.  
Tracheostomy  
Feeding tube insertions  
Mandibular distractor placement and removal.

**Preoperative history and physical:** (Don’t just focus on airway)  
Assess airway and respiratory status, mandibular and cervical mobility, glossal and oral size, and for any feeding difficulties. Assess for comorbidities including Velocardiofacial syndrome.

**A very difficult intubation is the issue  
**The larynx is not usually visible by direct laryngoscopy. Awake laryngoscopy is common, but may be difficult without adequate sedation. You do not want a moving, crying and gagging infant.

**Multiple Intubation Attempts  
**Multiple unsuccessful attempts can lead to intraoral bleeding, which complicates other approaches to securing the airway, such as fiberoptic bronchoscopy.

**Bag Mask Ventilation**The ability to mask the patient depends on the degree of micrognathia. It may be very difficult to adequately mask ventilate the patient.  

**Visualizing the glottis  
**A large cleft palate may hinder visualization of the larynx and/or create difficulty in navigation of the fiberoptic bronchoscope.

After passing a preloaded scope past the cords, there still may be difficulty sliding the ETT over the scope into the trachea.

Always have succinylcholine and atropine available.  
These infants may be particularly at risk of soft tissue trauma, bradycardia secondary to vagal stimulation, breath holding, and laryngospasm.

**Decreased FRC and increased metabolic demands  
**Be careful, many of these kids cannot tolerate short period of breath holding or laryngospasm without significant hypoxemia.

**Sedation and Intubation  
**Like any other awake intubation, your goal is to provide sufficient sedation and decrease movement, while maintaining spontaneous ventilation and protective airway reflexes.

**Ketamine and Precedex are popular**

**Ketamine** is popular with pediatric awake intubations because it causes minimal respiratory depression by maintaining near-normal ventilatory response to carbon dioxide.  
Ketamine also causes bronchodilation, potentially offsetting intubation-induced bronchospasm.  
Ketamine does cause an increase in airway secretions, which can be countered by Robinul.

**Precedex** has been successfully used for awake fiberoptic intubations. It is becoming more popular. Precedex is a selective alpha 2 agonist that has anxiolytic, moderate analgesic, and antisialagogue properties, with minimal respiratory impairment. One experienced Peds anesthesiologist I know will mix 10mcg in a 10mL syringe (1mcg/mL) and give 1cc at a time until he gets the desired effect. He will also administer small boluses of propofol (maybe 1cc).  
  
**LMA**  
The LMA can be a conduit for passage of a fiberoptic bronchoscope with difficult airways.

There are many different cocktails and technical intubation approaches that can be used to intubate a Pierre Robin patient.  
A thorough preoperative evaluation and equipment preparation along with immediate availability of capable assistance is more important.

**Emergence**  

On emergence, be prepared for central or obstructive apnea, and airway edema.
