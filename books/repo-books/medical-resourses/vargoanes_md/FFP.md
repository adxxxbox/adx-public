FFP    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)  
Also call plasma.

_4 units plasma increase most factors ~10%._**  
  
New Literature: FEIBA over FFP for anticoagulated bleedings patients  
**Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypass Activity (FEIBA) is an activated Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (aPCC) and is now preferred in many anticoagulant reversal protocols over FFP for severe-life threatening bleeds.  
1 dose of FEIBA is equivalent to over two liters of FFP.  
During an emergency bleed, you still must wait for FFP to be thawed whereas FEIBA is available as a lyophilized powder in a single-use vial containing nominally 500, 1,000 or 2,500 units per vial.**  
  
Warfarin Reversal**  
FFP (15 ml/kg) + vitamin K (phytonadione) 5-10 mg IV can be used to reverse warfarin. This is a common dose.  
  
**Life threatening bleed:** 4F-PCCs is preferred over FFP.  
10-20mL/kg of FFP can be unfused if 4-FPCC in not available.  
  
FFP contains all inactive components of the coagulation cascade in physiologic concentrations and has been traditionally been considered an option in patients on oral anticoagulants-especially warfarin.  
  
When a unit of blood is donated (whole blood), the plasma portion is separated and usually frozen for future use.  
When thawed, it is referred to as FFP.  
  
**FFP contains:  
**Albumin  
Clotting proteins  
Immunoglobulins  
Carbohydrates  
Salts  
Vitamins and other substances.  
  
FFP is free of red blood cells, leukocytes and platelets.  
FFP has ALL the procoagulants EXCEPT for platelets.  
FFP is efficacious for treatment of deficiencies of factors II, V, VII, IX, X, and XI. No RBCs, platelets or WBCs  
  
**Doses of FFP:**  
**Standard:** 5-10ml/kg  
**Usual:** 10ml/kg  
1-2 units given for every 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs).  
1 unit: volume is 200-250 ml.  
  
**2 units (400-500mL) for active bleeding confirmed by:**  
PT > 1.5 (>18 secs)  
PTT > 1.5 (55-60 secs)  
Fibrinogen < 100mg/dL  
2 units (400-500mL)**  
  
Common antidote dose for warfarin (Coumadin):**  
Vitamin K: 30 mcg/kg by slow IV infusion over 10-20 minutes (to avoid anaphylaxis). Max dose 2 mg.  
FFP: 20 ml/kg  
FFP is efficacious for treatment of deficiencies of factors II, V, VII, IX, X, and XI.  
  
**Most Frequent Indications:**  
PT > 1.5 (>18); Normal is 11-14 secs  
PTT > 1.5 (55-60) Normal is 30-45 secs  
One of the antidotes for Coumadin (warfarin).  
  
**Other Indications of FFP:**  
For deficiency of antithrombin III in patients undergoing surgery or who require heparin for treatment of thrombosis.  
  
**Treatment of Immunodeficiencies**  
For infants with secondary immunodeficiency associated with severe protein-losing enteropathy and in whom total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is ineffective.  
A source of immunoglobulin for children and adults with humoral immunodeficiency.  
**  
Fibrinogen**  
FFP also contains 500 mg of fibrinogen.  
The fibrinogen in 1 unit of FFP is approximately equal to the amount of fibrinogen found in 2 units of cryoprecipitate.  
  
**Cross Matching FFP**  
Some literature states you don't need cross match (check) FFP because life threatening allergic reactions are unlikely. However, many institutions still desire an ABO compatibility check.  
Transmission of HIV and Hepatitis is still possible.  
  
**How FFP is processed:**  
Separated from erythrocytes and platelets of whole blood and placed at 18° C or below within 8 hours after collection, stored at -18° C for 1-7 years and thawed before being transfused.  
After thawing it in a water bath at 37° C, the unit must be administered within 5 days.  
  
**_NOTE: The shelf life of thawed FFP is 5 days._**  
  
**FFP or PCC warfarin when urgent reversal is needed  
**FFP replaces coagulation factors lowered by warfarin. It contains all coagulant factors, including II, VII, IX, and X but in diluted inactive form compared to other option.  
5-20 ml/kg IV (~ 10ml/min) provides partial warfarin reversal.  
  
**Duration of FFP:** ≤ 6-7 hours (half-life of Factor 7 around 7 hours).
