### Sufenta (Sufentanil) as an Adjuvant to Neuraxial Anesthesia

Sufentanil is an extremely potent lipophilic phenylpiperidine derivative.  
Its analgesic potency is 5-7 times greater than fentanyl  
Sufentanil is 1600 times more lipid soluble than morphine and 2 times more than Fentanyl.  
Clinical differences between Sufenta and Fentanyl are small.  
Sufenta is 50mcg/cc  
More expensive than Fentanyl  
Sufenta has a greater spinal cord penetration with a slightly faster onset and longer duration than Fentanyl.  
After an epidural injection, Sufenta has lower maternal plasma concentrations and fetal umbilical vein and plasma levels compared to Fentanyl.  
Sufenta and Fentanyl both have a high lipid solubility and a low pKa, resulting in a highly potent analgesic effect, rapid onset, and short duration of action.  
However, opioids with diminished lipophilicity (morphine) have a slow onset and prolonged analgesia.  
Sufenta=Fast onset, short duration, and early respiratory depression (rare at recommended doses).  
  
**Sufenta Neuraxial Doses:  
Intrathecal:  
Doses:** 2.5-20mcg has been used with Bupivacaine for C-sections  
**Popular dose:** 5mcg  
There is little justification for > 5mcg due to pruritus and somnolence.  
One study showed that intrathecal bupivacaine (2.5 mg) without sufentanil did not provide satisfactory analgesia for parous patients. However, bupivacaine combined with 2.5mcg Sufenta provided analgesia comparable to higher doses, with a lower incidence of nausea and vomiting and less severe pruritus.  
**Onset:** 3-5 minutes**Duration:** 5-7 hours; Intrathecal Sufentanil lasts longer than Fentanyl  
  
**Epidural:  
Adjuvant to local Anesthetic with loading dose:** 10 to 15 mcg  
Individual doses of 10-15 mcg Sufenta plus 0.125% Bupivacaine 0.125% with epinephrine provide analgesia during the first stage of labor for 1 to 2 hours.  
**Onset:** within 10 minutes  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours.  
Subsequent doses (equal dose) tend to have shorter duration.  
The duration of initial doses of Sufenta plus bupivacaine with epinephrine is approximately 95 minutes, and of subsequent doses, 70 minutes.  
  
**Common mixture in Local Anesthetic Bag (continuous infusion)  
**3mcg/mL  
Opioids with high lipid solubility and low pKa result in an extremely potent analgesic effect, rapid onset, and short duration of action.  
However, opioids with diminished lipophilicity, such is morphine, have a slow onset and prolonged analgesia.  
  
**Method of Action:  
Intrathecal (Spinal) Opioids:  
Can bind to opioid receptors in three different areas to produce analgesia  
**1) Substantia Gelatinosa (Rexed’s lamina II) in the Dorsal Horn-have direct access, and it is their main source of action. The release of substance P is reduced, and the transmission of impulses through the Substantia Gelatinosa is inhibited.  
2) They are also transported supra-spinally by CSF flow, where they modulate descending inhibitory pain pathways.  
3) A small amount penetrates the dura mater into the epidural cavity and hence can reach the venous plexus of Baston and reach the systemic circulation, resulting in centrally mediated analgesia (minor effect).  
  
**Time of Possible Respiratory Depression:** Within 2 hours.  
It immediately penetrates the spinal cord and is absorbed systemically by neighboring blood vessels so that symptoms will show up much quicker.  
_(Morphine is much less lipid soluble and hangs out in the CSF longer, allowing it to move cephalad and possibly enter the brainstem, causing delayed respiratory depression.)_  
**Post of Analgesic for C-sections:** has a longer duration than Fentanyl but still be shorter compared to Morphine. That is why we also give morphine.  
  
**Doses: Adjuvant to local Anesthetic with loading dose:**  
**Active Metabolites:** None  
Its terminal elimination half-life is 150 minutes (shorter than fentanyl), so accumulation is less likely.  
**Metabolized By:** cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme in the liver and small intestines  
  
**Elimination:**  
\- 80% of the administered dose is excreted within 24 hours  
\- 10% of the dose is eliminated as an unchanged drug.  
  
**Pharmacokinetics of Fentanyl:  
pKa:8.01**  
**Remember:** the more nonionized, the faster the onset.  
**Plasma Protein bound (%):** 90, primarily to AAG  
**Terminal Half-Life:** 3.5 hours  
**Clearance (mL/min/kg):**  
  
**Side Effects:  
Urinary Retention (opioids):  
**Urinary retention is a problem mainly with hydrophilic spinal opioids (morphine) and has not been observed with lipophilic opioids.  
  
**Local Anesthetics and Urinary Retention:**  
Most of the urinary retention is from local anesthetics. The bladder is innervated from S3, S4 and S5.  
  
**Remember:** In the later stages of labor, we administer Top Off doses to cover S2-S4 to  
cover perineal pain.  
Even with just sensory (not motor) block, the patient loses the urge to micturate.  
This is why the patient’s Foley catheter remains in.  
**Pruritus and Sufenta:  
**Pregnant women are more susceptible to pruritus after neuraxial opioid administration than other populations, with the incidence of 60-100%Pruritus is the most common side effect, and nausea and vomiting are rare.  
Opioids can also induce itching at the spinal level by “itch-selective” secondary neurons in the lamina I spinothalamic tract of the dorsal horn.  
The mu receptor is also responsible for side effects, especially pruritus and nausea or vomiting.  
**  
PONV:  
**The fewer narcotics, usually the less PONV.
