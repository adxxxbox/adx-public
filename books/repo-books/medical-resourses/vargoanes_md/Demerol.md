# Demerol

**Demerol (Meperidine)**  
A synthetic opioid agonist (Narcotic) at Mu and Kappa receptors.  
**Anesthesia Indication**: Mostly used in post-op for shivering.  
**Dose:** 25-50mg is the standard dose for post op shivering.  
Anti-shivering effects are from the stimulation of the kappa receptors.  
Not used much for analgesia anymore due to it's metabolite Normeperidine, which lowers threshold to seizures.  
Demerol is 1/10th as potent as morphine.  
Structurally, Demerol is similar to Atropine, it possesses a mild atropine-like antispasmotic effect.  
Demerol is shorter acting than Morphine.  
Demerol is 50% weaker given orally versus IM.  
Causes more nausea compared to Fentanyl.  
**Metabolized:** Hepatic-90%  
**Eliminated:** Urinary excretion  
**Metabolite:** Normeperidine-can increase seizure activity.  
Normeperidine still has ½ the analgesia of Demerol.  
**Elimination half time:** 15 hours.  
Elimination < 35 hours with renal failure.  
It produced CNS stimulation.  
Can cause myoclonus and seizures.  
**Contraindicated:**  
Patients with seizure history
