| Respiratory Differences vs Adult |
| --- |
|   
Chest relatively small in relation to abdomen  
Ribs more horizontal, less A-P and lateral chest expansion  
Sternum and thoracic cage-soft and compliant  
Alveoli don't mature until late childhood,  
Intercostal muscles are weak and poorly developed  
Diaphragm and intercostal muscles are deficient in type 1, predominant in type II uscle fibers.  
Type II fibers muscle fibers are easily fatigued  
Tidal volume 6-8ml/kg  
Dead space to tidal volume is 30%  
Alveolar ventilation 150ml/kg/min (twice of adults)  
RR 35/min  
Tidal volume remains constant at 7ml/kg throughout life, the increased minute ventilation is from the high RR.  
Neonate’s alveolar ventilation is 3 times greater than adult’s because RR is 3 times greater.  
O2 consumption 6-7ml/kg/min, 2 times higher than adults  
O2 consumption is increased more with cold stress  
Increased CO2 production results from higher metabolic rate  
Increased V/Q mismatch  
Decreased FRC until 24 months  
FRC only 27-30 mL/kg-smaller than adults  
Low FRC limits 02 reserves during intubation (apnea) with prone to atelectasis  
Low FRC  
Decreased compliance  
Oxyhemoglobin curve shifted to the left because of increased fetal hemoglobin affinity and decreased DPG |
