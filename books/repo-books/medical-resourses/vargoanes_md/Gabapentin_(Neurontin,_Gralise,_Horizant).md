Gabapentin (Neurontin, Gralise, Horizant)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Gabapentin (Neurontin, Gralise, Horizant)

Glutamate inhibitor.  
A gabapentinoid.  
(Pregabalin is also a gabapentinoid, but less frequently used than gabapentin).  
  
**Simply said:** Gabapentin is being used more frequently in anesthesia because when administered PO 1-2 hours preoperatively, it reduces intraoperative narcotics and post-op pain.  
  
Originally developed for the treatment of epilepsy.  
Presently, gabapentin is widely used to relieve pain, especially neuropathic pain. It is tolerated in most patients, has a relatively mild side-effect profile, and passes through the body unmetabolized.  
  
**Indications  
**Postherpetic neuralgia  
Epilepsy (adjuvant therapy for seizure disorders).  
Fibromyalgia  
Neuropathic pain  
Restless leg syndrome  
  
**Gabapentin and enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS)**  
Commonly added to ERAS protocols and administered 1-2 hours pre-operatively.  
  
**Documented pre-op doses:** 300-1,200 mg**Common ERAS preoperative dose:** 300 mg**Peds:** 300 mg  
**Less than 3 years:** Not recommended  
  
**Absorption:  
Metabolism:** Not metabolized, excreted unchanged.**Half-life:** 5-7 hours**Protein binding:** < 3%  
**Clearance:** 190 mL/min  
**Elimination:** Renal; unchanged  
**Toxicity:** Symptoms of overdose include ataxia, labored breathing, ptosis, sedation, hypoactivity and excitation.  
  
**Renal Dose Adjustments**  
**For patients greater than or equal to 12 years:**  
**Creatinine clearance (CrCl) greater than 60 mL/min:** 300 to 1200 mg orally 3 times a day.  
**CrCl 30 to 59 mL/min:** 200 to 700 mg orally daily; increase to 600 mg as needed.  
**CrCl 15 to less than 29 mL/min:** 200 to 700 mg orally once a day.  
**CrCl 15 mL/min:** 100 to 300 mg orally every other day.  
**CrCl less than 15 mL/minute:** Reduce daily dose in proportion to CrCl based on dose for CrCl 15 mL/minute (e.g., for a CrCl of 7.5 mL/min, reduce the daily dose by one-half to 50 to 150 mg/day).  
  
**When administered:**  
Pre operatively: most frequent used  
Post incision  
Post operatively  
  
**There is good evidence that oral gabapentin administered pre-operatively will:**  
  
Decrease intraoperative narcotics.  
Decrease postoperative analgesic requirements.  
  
**Other studies showed:  
**Decreased inhalation agent consumption  
Decreased PONV  
  
**Peak plasma level after oral administration:** 2 hours.  
Peak cerebrospinal fluid level is longer.  
  
**Mechanism of Action  
**Gabapentin is structurally related to the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) but it does not modify GABAAand GABAB. It is not converted metabolically into GABA or a GABA agonist, and it is not an inhibitor of GABA uptake or degradation.  
However, it does increases the synaptic concentration of GABA, enhances GABA responses at non-synaptic sites in neuronal tissues, and reduces the release of mono-amine neurotransmitters. One of the mechanisms implicated in this effect of gabapentin is the reduction of the axon excitability measured as an amplitude change of the presynaptic fibre volley (FV) in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. This is mediated through its binding to presynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Other studies have shown that the antihyperalgesic and antiallodynic effects of gabapentin are mediated by the descending noradrenergic system, resulting in the activation of spinal alpha2\-adrenergic receptors. Gabapentin has also been shown to bind and activate the adenosine A1 receptor.  
  
Gabapentin interacts with cortical neurons at auxiliary subunits of voltage-sensitive calcium channels.  
  
**Possible side effects**  
Sedation  
Dizziness  
Headache  
Visual disturbances  
Peripheral edema  
Ataxia
