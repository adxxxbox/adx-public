### Wave Forms to Waveforms

**‘A’ waves (or plateau waves)** are bad!  
Exemplifies a steep increase in ICP from near normal values to 40 or more mmHg for 5–20 minutes then return to a new baseline. Plateau waves are always pathological and occur in patients with intact autoregulation and reduced intracranial compliance.  
These waves represent a reduced intracranial hypertension indicative of early brain herniation.  
Some “A” waves may reach elevations of 50 to 100 mmHg, persist for 5 to 20 minutes, then drop sharply, signaling exhaustion of the brain's compliance mechanisms.  
  
**‘B’ waves**  
Short elevations of only 10-20mmHg that occur at a frequency of 0.5-2Hz and were thought to relate to relate to respiratory fluctuations in PaCO2 or vasomotor waves.  
These waves are probably related to changes in vascular tone. 

**‘C’ waves**  
More rapid sinusoidal fluctuations occurring approximately every 10 seconds, corresponding to Traube-Hering-Mayer fluctuations in arterial pressure. They have been documented in healthy subjects and are probably caused by interaction between the cardiac and respiratory cycles.
