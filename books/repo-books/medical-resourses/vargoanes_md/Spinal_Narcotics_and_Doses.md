### Spinals Narcotics and Doses

**Preservative Free (PF) Morphine (Astromorph, Duramorph) common dose range for Spinal/C-sections**  
0.1-0.25 mg of Astromorph is commonly added to Bupivacaine  
  
**Preservative Free (PF) Fentanyl common dose range for Spinal/C-sections  
**10-25 mcg of Fentanyl is commonly added to Bupivacaine  
  
It is common to add (mix) PF fentanyl and Astromorph with Bupivacaine in a spinal dose for a C-section.  
  
Preservative free opioids may be given intrathecally as a single injection or intermittently via an epidural or intrathecal catheter.  
  
High doses of opioids are required to achieve analgesia when administered alone-in the absence of a local anesthetic. An opioid alone is usually not adequate enough to cover labor pain, so we usually combine it with a local anesthetic.  
  
High doses of opioids are usually avoided due to the possible side effects of respiratory depression, pruritus and fetal bradycardia.  
  
**Advantage of Spinal Opioids Alone (not combined with a local anesthetic)  
**_(with exception to Demerol)  
_Do not produce a motor blockade (parturient is still able to push).  
Do not produce a functional sympathectomy that produces maternal hypotension.  
An option for certain cardiac patients who cannot tolerated a sympathectomy such as aortic stenosis, tetralogy of Fallot, Eisenmenger’s or pulmonary hypertension.  
  
**Disadvantage of Spinal Opioids Alone  
**Less complete analgesia  
Lack of perineal relaxation  
**Side effects:** pruritus, nausea, vomiting, sedation and respiratory depression.  
  
**Narcan for respiratory depression  
**A dose of 40mcg-200mcg IV is usually sufficient.
