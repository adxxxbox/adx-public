### Pacemaker/AICD and Electrocautery Review

People with all types of implanted devices do need to be aware that their device can be affected by electromagnetic interference (EMI). A bovie for electrocautery is an EMI device.**  
  
Electromagnetic interference (EMI)  
**Any apparatus that emits radiofrequency waves between 0 and 10 9  Hz can generate EMI and therefore interfere with proper device function. The main source of intraoperative EMI we are concerned with is an electrocautery device (bovie) used by the surgeon.  
  
Any EMI device used too near a pacemaker in the synchronous mode setting in any pacer-dependent patient could be disastrous.  
  
If the electrocautery is used within 6 inches or less from the pulse generator of the pacemaker, the pacemaker may detect the EMI from the bovie and interpret the electric signals as if there was an R wave. The pacemaker is then inhibited and will no longer pace. This may result in profound bradycardia or asystole for a pacemaker dependent patient. The application of a magnet to convert the pacemaker to asynchronous mode prevents this from happening.  
  
**EMI and AICD  
**An AICD may misinterpret the EMI as VT or SVT and deliver a shock.  
**  
There are two types of EMI, both of which anesthesia providers should understand:**  
**Monopolar:** For dissection and coagulation, the most popular.  
**Bipolar:** Safer, with implantable electrical devices and only capable of coagulation.  
**Monopolar (unipolar) electrocautery** (most popular):The electric impulse will travel from the handheld bovie to the grounding pad, then back to the generator. The grounding pad has an inactive electrode.  
**Recommendation for surgeon when monopolar cautery is used with a pacemaker or AICD:**  
When a surgeon is using monopolar cautery on a patient with a pacemaker or AICD, it is recommended to use pauses with several short bursts of electrocautery, because it is much safer than continuous. The arrhythmia detection for ICDs usually requires several continuous seconds of a tachycardial activity before anti-tachycardial pacing is instituted.  
The cautery dispersion pad should be placed on the patient in a way that the path of the EMI does not cross over the CIED generator.  
  
**Bipolar:** Uses lower voltages so less energy is required.  
More ideally used for those procedures where tissues can be easily grabbed on both sides by the forceps electrode. The electrosurgical current in the patient is restricted to just the tissue between the arms of the forceps electrode. This gives better control over the area being targeted, and helps prevent damage to other sensitive tissues. It should be used in patients with implanted devices to prevent electrical current passing through the device and possibly causing a short-circuit or misfire.  
  
Current pacemakers have advanced noise-filtration techniques and are fairly resistant to common EMI sources. They are rarely dysfunctional during surgery.  
**Major sources of interference that can inhibit a pacemaker are:  
**Electrocautery  
Radio-frequency ablation  
Radiation therapy  
Electrical nerve and muscle stimulators  
Dental instruments  
  
**Methods to decrease EMI to the pacemaker or AICD:  
**Surgeon should use a Harmonic device rather than a Bovie.  
The Harmonic uses heat, whereas the Bovie uses an electric current.The use of bipolar instead of monopolar cautery is suggested.  
  
**_It is important to make completely sure the OR staff does not stick the grounding pad anywhere near the pacemaker!_**  
  
**Grounding Pad Placement:  
**The grounding pad should be as far away from the pacemaker or AICD as possible.  
This will keep the electric pathway between the bovie and the grounding pad away from the implanted device. If the pacemaker or AICD is between the bovie and the grounding pad, it may be disastrous.  
  
**Your EKG Monitor:**  
Disable filtering of pacer spikes. Use a lead that shows pacer spikes to confirm that pacemaker is functioning appropriately.
