ACT (Activating Clotting Time)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### ACT (Activating Clotting Time)

The activated clotting time (ACT) is commonly used to monitor treatment with high-dose heparin before, during, and shortly after medical procedures that require that blood be prevented from clotting, such as heart bypass surgery, vascular procedures, cardiac angioplasty, and dialysis.  
  
_ACT is normally measured intraoperatively with an iSTAT machine._  
  
The ACT measures the inhibiting effect that heparin has on the body's clotting system, not the actual level of heparin in the blood.  
  
**ACT Levels  
****Normal:** 70 to 120 seconds is the usual amount of time for blood to clot without heparin.  
**Heparinized patient:** 180 to 240 seconds is the usual amount of time for blood to clot with heparin. This is called the therapeutic range.  
  
**ACT and Lupus**  
The ACT test is also sometimes used to monitor regular-dose heparin therapy in people with documented lupus anticoagulant (LAC).  
The PTT test cannot be used in those patients because LAC interferes with the PTT.  
  
**ACT and new anticoagulants  
**In rare clinical situations, the ACT test may also be used to monitor the inhibiting effects of direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g., argatroban) on the clotting system.  
**Ex.** ACT is used to monitor argatroban in selected cardiac procedures- PCIs.  
  
However, the ACT may be elevated with the other newer anticoagulants, but it is not accurate, lacking linear correlation.  
  
Occasionally, the ACT may be measured during a bleeding episode or used as part of a bedside evaluation of a person's heparin anticoagulation level, particularly if the person has lupus anticoagulant.  
  
The ACT is measured in seconds: the longer the time to clot, the higher the degree of clotting inhibition.

The amount of heparin needed to reach and maintain a certain ACT (for instance, 300 seconds) will vary as will the body's clotting potential at that ACT.  
If there are clotting or bleeding problems, the dosages and ACT may need to be adjusted accordingly.  
  
**ACT and PTT  
**ACT and PTT results are not interchangeable. They may overlap but have poor correlation. ACT and PTT results should be evaluated independently.  
The ACT test is generally less sensitive than the aPTT test.  
  
ACT test results may be affected (prolonged) by thrombocytopenia, thrombopathy and hemodilution.  
The aPTT is not affected by platelet numbers.  
  
The ACT can be run only on fresh whole blood and is only available as a patient-side test. The aPTT can be run on fresh or citrated whole blood samples and is available both in-house and at the reference laboratory.
