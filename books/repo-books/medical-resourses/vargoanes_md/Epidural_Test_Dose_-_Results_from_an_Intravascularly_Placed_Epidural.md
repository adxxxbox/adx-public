### Epidural Test Dose - Results from an Intravascularly Placed Epidural

The incidence of unintended intravascular entry by epidural catheters is estimated to be between 4.9% and 7% in the obstetrical population (literature varies). This appears to occur more often when the patient is sitting up.  
  
_You should always aspirate BEFORE and AFTER (especially after) all epidural injections to check for blood and CSF.  
  
**Remember:** Pregnant women are at a higher risk for unintentional intravenous cannulation due to the engorgement of epidural veins._  
  
**Negative aspiration BEFORE an epidural administration  
**Withdrawing zero blood or CSF back into a newly inserted epidural catheter prior to injecting a test dose may NOT exclude intravascular catheter placement because the catheter may be against a vein wall and because aspiration can collapse the vein lumen.  
_Aspiration alone prior to an epidural injection fails to detect up to 86% of vascular entries.  
  
_**NOTE:** Some literature advocates checking for drainage of CSF or blood to gravity rather than to aspiration due to aspirating, even gently done, collapsing the vein lumen or pulling the catheter’s orifices against tissue in the subarachnoid space, thus occluding the orifice(s).**  
  
Negative aspiration immediately AFTER an epidural administration  
**Withdrawing zero blood or CSF back into a newly inserted epidural AFTER the injection of a test dose is more effective in recognizing intravascular catheter placement. The reason is that the local anesthetic will push the vein wall away and may also dilate the blood vessels. Placing the epidural catheter 45 to 50 degrees below the patient’s body level at this stage can help the blood to flow through the catheter if it is intravascular.  
Aspiration alone prior to an epidural injection fails to detect up to 86% of vascular entries.  
Studies indicates that blood aspiration may be initially negative and a test dose becomes positive immediately after the injection of local anesthetics.  
  
**Test Dose with an inadvertent Intravascularly placed Epidural Catheter  
  
Note:** _Failure to recognize intravenous placement of the epidural catheter and subsequent intravenous injection of a LARGE dose of local anesthetic may lead to systemic local anesthetic toxicity. Local anesthetic toxicity may lead to with CNS symptoms, seizures, cardiovascular collapse, or death.  
_This is why many anesthesia providers no longer use Bupivacaine.  
  
Since the test dose has epinephrine in it, it should naturally increase the HR and BP when injected **Intravascularly.  
**Increase in heart rate is supposed to serve as the main marker for intravenous injection.**  
  
Epinephrine induced symptoms resulting of a test dose when the catheter is placed intravascularly**  
HR should increase from a mean of **80** ± 15 to **110** ± 15 beats per minute.  
  
Should occur within 23 ± 6 seconds following the injection.  
  
Returned to baseline within 32 ±33 seconds.  
  
**NOTE:** The epinephrine in a test dose may produce “jitteriness” several minutes after injection of the test dose because of systemic absorption. Similarly, the lidocaine may produce hypesthesia experienced as “tingling” in the perineum or lower extremities sometime after injection due to the effect of epidurally injected lidocaine on the nerve roots.  
  
**Simply Stated, intravascular injection of 15 mcg of epinephrine in the test dose produces:**  
An increase in heart rate of 20-30 bpm within 45 seconds.  
An increase in systolic blood pressure of between 15 and 25 mmHg.  
  
**HR may also increase with a uterine contraction-so don’t be fooled  
**The increase in maternal heart rate needs to be distinguish from **contraction-induced increase** in heart rate.  
Tracking your patient’s contractions is important to reduce the risk of misinterpretation of the test dose. Literature states you should administer a test dose between contractions _(at the onset of uterine diastole)._  
  
Unfortunately, frequent heart rate changes are common in laboring patients.  
Epinephrine containing test dose lacks both _specificity_ AND _sensitivity_ in laboring women and may elicit false positive responses.  
  
**Sometimes there is NO cardiovascular change with an intravascular injection** Unfortunately, in some pregnant women, 15mcg of epinephrine might NOT be _sensitive or specific_ enough to rule out accidental intravascular epidural injection. This is why _epinephrine administered for the diagnosis of accidental intravascular injections remains controversial._**  
  
Is your patient on a Beta Blocker?**  
Parturients who are being treated with **β-blocking** drugs may **NOT** show tachycardia, even when the epinephrine is administered intravascularly.  
  
**Don’t Always Rely on HR AloneIs your patient experiencing symptoms of local anesthetic toxicity?  
Ask you patient if they are experiencing:**  
Ringing in their ears  
Metallic taste in their mouth  
Tongue numbness  
Light headedness  
Disoriented  
Blurred vision  
  
**Note:** Did you ever bolus your EGD patient with100 mg of lidocaine to blunt their gag reflex before administering propofol? They usually inform you of the metallic mouth taste and ringing in their ears.
