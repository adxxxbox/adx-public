### Treatment Options for Deficiencies

**Factor concentrates**  
Clotting factor concentrates are available only for factors I, VII, VIII, XI, and XIII.  
Usually made from human plasma and treated to eliminate viruses like HIV and hepatitis B and C.  
  
**Recombinant factor VIII and recombinant factor VIIa**  
They are made in the laboratory and not from human plasma.  
Initially for hemophiliacs.  
  
**Activated PCC (aPCC)-FEIBA  
**FEIBA stands for **F**actor **E**ight (VIII) **I**nhibitor **B**ypassing **A**ctivity (FEIBA).  
Contains Factors 2,7,9, 10 and protein C.  
Initially for bypassing hemophiliac inhibitors (antibodies).  
FVII primarily in an activated form.  
Zymogen forms of the pro-coagulant factors FII, FVII, FIX, FX.  
Anticoagulant protein C in a balanced ratio of 1 U/1 U FEIBA.  
Trace amounts of the activated form of factors II, IX and X as well as activated factor VII.  
Factor VIII coagulant antigen (F VIII C:Ag).  
Trace amounts of kallikrein-kinin system.  
Used with caution due to a risk in thrombosis.  
  
**Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC)**  
Made from human plasma and contains a mixture of clotting factors, including factors II, VII, IX, and X (however, some products do not contain all four factors).  
PCC is suitable for individual deficiencies of factor II and X as well as inherited combined deficiency of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (VKCFD).  
It is treated to eliminate viruses like HIV and hepatitis B and C.  
Some PCCs have been reported to cause thrombosis.  
  
**Fresh frozen plasma (FFP)**  
FFP contains all the clotting factors, as well as other blood proteins.  
Can be used to treat rare bleeding disorders when concentrates of the specific factor that is missing are not available.  
FFP is the usual treatment for factor V deficiency.  
However, it usually does not undergo viral inactivation, so the risk of transmission of infectious diseases is higher.  
  
**Cryoprecipitate**  
Made from human plasma Contains factor VIII, fibrinogen (factor I), and a few other proteins important for blood clotting.  
Cryoprecipitate does not undergo viral inactivation and should only be used when factor concentrate is not available.  
It contains higher concentrations than FFP of some (but not all) coagulation factors, so less volume is needed.  
It is only suitable for a few deficiencies.  
  
**Desmopressin**  
Desmopressin is a synthetic hormone that raises the levels of factor VIII in patients with combined factor V and factor VIII deficiency.  
No risk of transmission of infectious diseases.  
Has no effect on the levels of any of the other coagulation factors.  
Can be administered intra-nasally or intravenously.  
  
**Antifibrinolytic drugs**  
Tranexamic acid (TXA) and aminocaproic acid (Amicar) are used to hold a clot in place in certain parts of the body, such as the mouth, bladder, and uterus.  
TXA has become more widely used in joint replacement and trauma.  
Antifibrinolytic drugs are particularly useful for patients with factor XI deficiency.  
They are also used to help control excessive menstrual bleeding.  
Can be administered orally or by injection.  
**  
Fibrin glue**  
Fibrin glue can be used to treat external wounds and during dental work, such as a tooth extraction. It is not used for major bleeding or surgery.  
It is applied to the bleeding site.  
  
**Platelet transfusions**  
Certain clotting factors, including factor V, are stored inside platelets.  
Platelet transfusions are sometimes used to treat factor V deficiency.  
  
**Vitamin K**  
Treatment with vitamin K (oral or injection) can help control symptoms of inherited combined deficiency of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (VKCFD).  
However, not everyone responds to this type of treatment.  
People who do not respond to vitamin K and have a bleed or need surgery will need factor replacement.  
  
**Hormonal Contraceptives**  
Hormonal contraceptives help control menstrual bleeding.  
**  
Intra-uterine devices (IUDs)**  
Intra-uterine devices (IUDs) help control menstrual bleeding.
