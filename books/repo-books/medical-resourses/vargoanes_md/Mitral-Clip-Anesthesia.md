### Mitral Clip Anesthesia

**(Percutaneous Mitral Valve Repair or MitraClip Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair)

MitraClip is an endovascular procedure to treat mitral regurgitation (MR) for those who are too high risk for open-heart surgery.  
  
The MitraClip system is a minimally invasive approach to repair the mitral valve and treat mitral regurgitation (MR). It consists of a steerable catheter with a small clip at the end that is inserted through the femoral vein. Using fluoroscopy and ultrasound, the catheter and clip are advanced through the femoral vein, across the inter-atrial septum, and into the left atrium. The clip is then used to grip the two leaflets of the valve. Closing the clip creates a competent double orifice valve, which allows forward flow while minimizing backward flow. Multiple clips may be placed if necessary.   
  
This MitraClip procedure has been performed in more than 10,000 patients worldwide since 2003.  
  
**Indications:** As a potential treatment option for patients who are too high risk for open-heart surgery for mitral regurgitation, mitral insufficiency or mitral incompetence with 3+ MR.  
  
**Advantages:  
**No sternotomy (open heart surgery)No cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)  
Quicker recovery  
No blood transfusion  
  
When the Mitral Clip procedure was fairly new, anesthesia providers were more aggressive in setting up available emergency drips for “just in case.” With any minimally invasive procedure there is always a risk of effusion or perforation, so always know where your emergency drugs are and have a plan.  
Due to more experienced surgeons and advancements, the anesthesia setup is less extensive. These patients are always General with ETT, because TEE probe (+fluoroscopy) is used to guide the placement of mitral clips.  
  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
Fentanyl (100mcg,) Versed (2mg)  
Amidate or Propofol (depending on pt %EF)  
Succinylcholine  
Vecuronium or Rocuronium  
  
**Position:** Supine and arms tucked, foam padding under the patient legs to prevent breakdown from lying on device stabilizing board.  
**Duration:** 3-4 hours  
**EBL:** 50 ml  
**IV Access:** 2 Large Bore PIV ( have a blood set connected , and availability to push emergency drugs .  
**Fluid warmers:** 1 high flow  
**Bed warmer:** Upper body Bair Hugger.  
**A-Line:** radial, in arm with highest noninvasive blood pressure. Line placed prior to induction.  
**Swan setup:** No swan needed. Swan would occupy space in the heart that is used for clip introducer during placement.  
**Fluid:** Albumin is the fluid of choice. It is important to keep the heart full since many patients with MR lose forward flow volume to eject.  
  
**IV pump setup:**  
Neosynephrine 20mg/250ml or  
Levophed 8mg/250ml (many of these patients have moderate - severe pulmonary hypertension d/t chronic backflow of volume. If pulmonary HTN is a problem Levophed is the pressor of choice as Neosynephrine increases PA pressures).  
Heparin 25000units/250ml (if surgeon is fast you may not use Heparin drip, just IVP heparin from a 20cc syringe).  
Normal Saline Carrier – Run around 20-50ml/hr.  
  
**Vasoactive Drugs:**  
Neosynephrine 80mcg/ml  
Ephedrine 5mg/ml  
Levophed 16mcg/ml  
Vasopressin 2u/ml  
  
**Heparin**  
Heparin is given to prevent clotting of catheters and clip introduction devices.  
Surgeon will announce when to dose heparin initially.  
Initial heparin dose 150 units/kg bolus, 20 units/kg infusion.  
**  
ACTs**  
Maintain ACT >250 \[range 250 to 300 preferred\] for case duration.  
Titrate heparin infusion and boluses to maintain target ACT.  
Check ACT 5 min after initial heparin dose and every 15-30 min for case duration.  
Reverse Heparin with Protamine at end of case.  
  
**Possible Complications**  
Hemorrhage  
MR recurrence  
Infection  
Pericardial effusion (TEE should assess for effusion before probe removal. If you develop unexplained persistent hypotension, consider effusion).  
  
**More Notes:**  
It is more difficult to control hemodynamics in patients experiencing frequent ectopy. Consider giving 2gms Magnesium Sulfate to reduce cardiac irritability.  
  
Most patient instability will occur during clip placement attempts. As the clip is being placed and positioned, they will open the clip, often blocking blood flow between atrium and ventricle. Be prepared to use Neosynephrine or Levophed to keep blood pressure within 20% of baseline. Communicate with surgeon, because this hypotension can be transient, and you do not want to overtreat causing hypertension.  
  
Levophed is often the preferred vasopressor of patients with MR due to the increase in contractility. Neosynephrine may cause SVR to increase too much, leading to worsening MR.  
  
Prior US and European studies have evaluated the MitraClip system in individuals with primary, degenerative mitral regurgitation and functional mitral regurgitation. For patients with:  
**Primary, degenerative mitral regurgitation:** The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the MitraClip system in October 2013 for routine clinical use in the US for patients with significant symptomatic degenerative mitral regurgitation who are at prohibitive risk for mitral valve surgery.  
**Functional mitral regurgitation:** The MitraClip system is currently not approved for routine clinical use in patients with functional mitral regurgitation. Prior research in this patient population has shown, however, that the MitraClip procedure is very safe: One year after the device implantation, more than three-quarters of patients had significantly reduced mitral regurgitation and no, or only mild, heart failure symptoms. The heart regained a smaller size and shape and less than one in ten patients required additional open-heart surgery. A research study called the COAPT trial now aims to expand this knowledge. The COAPT trial evaluates the safety and effectiveness of the MitraClip system against optimal medical therapy in individuals with symptomatic, at least moderate-to-severe functional mitral regurgitation and who are extremely high risk for mitral valve surgery.
