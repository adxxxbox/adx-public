Vasectomy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Vasectomy

Vasectomy is usually done in the surgeon's office using local anesthesia. We only see the patients who have high anxiety or health issues.  
  
The surgeon will make a small surgical cut in the upper part of the scrotum, and tie off and cut apart the vas deferens. The surgeon will use stitches or a skin glue to close the wound.

**No-Scalpel Vasectomy (NSV):**  
The surgeon will find the vas deferens by feeling the patient’s scrotum.   
The surgeon will then make a tiny hole in the skin of the scrotum and seal off the vas deferens. He/she will usually pull the vas deferens through the tiny hole in order to tie it off and cut it apart.  
**Anesthetic:** Usually a MAC. General or Spinal is optional but very rare.
