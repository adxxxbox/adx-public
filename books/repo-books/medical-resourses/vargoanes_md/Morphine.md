# Morphine

**Morphine (Duramorph, Astromorph)**  
The prototypical opioid that all narcotics are compared to.  
**Class:** Opiate agonist  
Inhibits ascending pain pathways  
**Doses**  
**Adults:** 2-10mg

**Epidural**:2-6mg Q8-24h  
**Duration**: 3-6 hours  
**Histamine release:** Yes  
**Active Metabolite:** M-6-glucoronide.  
Potency, 10mg morphine = 100ug of fentanyl.  
Poor penetration into CNS (poorly lipid soluble).  
Metabolized in liver and kidneys (renal problems mean increased plasma concentration but not hepatic problems).  
It took its name from the Greek god of dreams "Morpheus" the Greek god of dreams. Name was changed to "morphine" by the French chemist Joseph Gay-Lussac.  
Morphine drastically gained popularity on the Civil War battlefields.  
Constipation: Acts on the myenteric plexus in the intestinal tract, reducing motility, causing constipation-mediated by mu-opioid receptors in the bowel.  
**Side Effects:**  
Respiratory Depression  
Urinary retention  
Decreased peristalsis (constipation).  
Ileus.  
Bradycardia (increased vagal tone).  
Histamine release.  
Stimulates CTZ (N&V, dryness).  
Decreased CBF.  
Mu 2 effect causes less response to CO2 and thus hypoventilation  
Decreased cough reflex.  
Increased biliary tone and pressure during ERCPs.  
**Morphine Drip Table**  
**Loading Dose:** 5-15mg  
1-10mg/hr  
50mg in 50mL NS =1mg/1ml  
100mg in 100 mL NS = 1mg/ml  
Usual concentration for continuous I.V. infusion: 0.1 to 1 mg/mL in D5W or NS.  
Most just use a 1:1 ratio to keep it simple.
