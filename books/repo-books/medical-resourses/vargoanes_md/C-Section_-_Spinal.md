### Cesarean Section (C-section) - Spinal

Hypotension is much more severe with a spinal/C-section than an epidural for vaginal delivery. A C-section requires a much higher block of T-4, rather than a T-10 for vaginal.  
  
**Anesthetic:** Neuraxial via SAB (sub-arachnoid block)  
**Incision time to delivery:** 5-15 minutes  
**Duration:** 45-90 minutes  
**EBL:** 500 or 1 liter is popular  
**IV Access:** 18G is preferred. Make sure it runs well or start another when her arms are out. AC is a popular site due to convenience.  
**Pre-hydrate:** 20cc/kg if possible  
**Pre op Meds:** Bicitrate and Pepcid (not as routine as before).  
**Antibiotics:** 1-2 grams of Ancef (if not contraindicated, check with MD).  
  
**Possible Complications:**  
Hemorrhage  
Utero-cervical lacerationsEmbolus  
Nausea  
Ileus  
Failed Spinal-anxiety  
Bladder Perforation  
Regional anesthesia complications  
  
**Room Set up:  
**Spinal Kit (and cart) and narcotics  
**Pitocin:** Prepare (2) 20 unit doses in 1 Liter bags.  
You should have (2) 1 liter bags containing 20 units of Pitocin each (don’t forget to label them).  
Ephedrine and Neosynephrine Syringes  
**Warning:** Limit the total dose of ephedrine to 10 to 20mg. Ephedrine in larger doses is associated with neonatal acidosis.  
1 Neosynephrine Bag  
Suction and emesis bowl  
  
**Readily available drugs:  
**Ofirmev, Toradol, Zofran, Ketamine, Versed, Narcotics, Methergine and Hemabate.  
RSI equipment and drugs  
  
**Patient arrives to the room and spinal  
**Have narcotics ready for spinal.  
Baseline vitals before spinal.  
Set BP to Q 1min.  
Administer 1-2 grams of Ancef (if not contraindicated, check with MD).  
Consider a dose of Neo or Ephedrine as soon as spinal is complete.  
Consider Neo drip for a low baseline BP.  
  
**Note:** Consider a simultaneous 40mcg to 80mcg IV phenylephrine bolus during the SAB (if not contraindicated).  
Consider having a phenylephrine infusion already primed and connected to the patient’s IV preset and on “Pause mode”  
Administer ondansetron prior to SAB.  
  
You should inform the patient to let you know ASAP when she is starting to feel nauseated. We all know nausea after the spinal is related to hypotension. You can quickly give her some Neo or Ephedrine.  
  
**Supine position (after spinal):** Left Tilt (IV bag works)  
3-4 NC and connect EKG pads.  
Arms out and secured, IV wide open.  
Carefully observe next BP and watch for nausea.  
Foley inserted by RN, observe patient’s reaction. If she feels the insertion of the Foley, beware of a slow acting or poor spinal block.  
Surgeon will test the spinal distribution by pinching abdomen.  
  
**Incision:** Reinforce patient “Pressure vs Pain.”  
Keep BP adequate.  
Uterus open and amniotic sac ruptured.  
Baby on it’s way out, hang Pitocin (don’t start it).  
  
**Baby is out, umbilical cord is clamped:  
**Start the first 1 liter of LR bag with the 20 units of Pitocin- wide open.  
Administer Ofirmev or Toradol or both (check EBL).  
If mom is over anxious after delivery: You can administer 2mg of versed.  
When the 1 st Pitocin bag is empty, hang #2 bag and run it slower.  
Many times the #2 bag of Pitocin will still be infusing while you take the patient to recovery room.  
  
**Uterus is placed back in the mother’s abdomen and MD is closing the incision.  
**Patient will complain of pressure  
Maintain BP and patient comfort.  
Tally up I & Os.  
Transport the patient to the OB Recovery Room.  
  
It is OK for the mother to breast feed after receiving Tylenol and Toradol. They are both on the American Academy of Pediatrics list of medications appropriate for breastfeeding mothers.  
You can administer Toradol if it is not contraindicated prior to going to the recovery room.  
  
**Indications for C-section**  
Prolonged labor (or failure to progress)  
Dystocia  
Apparent fetal distress  
Apparent maternal distress or complications such as pre-eclampsia or eclampsia  
Multiple births  
Abnormal presentation, i.e. breech presentation; failed induction of labor; failed instrumental delivery.  
The baby is too large (macrosomia).  
The mother has a low-lying placenta or placenta previa.  
Contracted pelvis  
Evidence of intrauterine infection.  
Previous C-section (though this is controversial)  
Prior problems with healing of the perineum, such as from childbirth or Crohn's Disease.  
  
**More Notes  
**Higher sensory and sympathetic block to T2 results in peripheral vasodilation, capillary engorgement and a decreased venous return. This is all associated with a 30-50% incidence of hypotension, even if the patient was pre-hydrated with 20mL/kg and left lateral tilt is maintained.  
**  
If the C-Section patient currently has an epidural - 3 Possible Doses:  
**This makes it easy because the patient does not need a spinal.  
You simply redose the epidural.  
20-25mLs of 2% Lidocaine with or without epinephrine (1:200,000), plus Fentanyl 50 mcg.  
20-25mLs of 0.5% Bupivacaine with 50mcg of fentanyl.  
20-30mLs of 3% Chloroprocaine**  
  
Treatment of Hypotension:  
**Increase lateral tilt - we rarely do this  
Increase IV fluids while you administer 5-10mg of ephedrine or 40-100mcg of Neosynephrine as the first fall in blood pressure is noted.
