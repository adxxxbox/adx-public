### Burns and Neuro

Central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction is common in burn patients.  
CNS injury may occur from hypoxia related to pulmonary injury or carbon monoxide toxicity.

A small percentage of children may result in encephalopathy (neuro checks and seizure precautions may be necessary especially for non-verbal children).

Symptoms may post 48 hours after the injury and are often accompanied by multiple metabolic abnormalities including hypocalcemia; caution electrolyte shifts associated with burn etiology, resuscitation fluids, and blood component replacement.  
  
CNS dysfunction etiology may be secondary to hematologic and metabolic abnormalities.  
  
Seizures may also occur after carbon monoxide poisoning.

The spinal cord, brain, and the heart may acquire direct injury if electrical burn current crosses these areas.

Cerebral edema may occur up to three days after a burn injury.

Severe hypertensive may cause encephalopathy and seizures.

Encephalopathic patients will require much less anesthetics.

Preoperative sedation for encephalopathic patients may be unnecessary.
