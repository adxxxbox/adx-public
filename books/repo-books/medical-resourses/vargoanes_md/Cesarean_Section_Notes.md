### **Cesarean Section (General) Review Notes**

With a general anesthesia for C-section, The goal is to reduce the baby's exposure to anesthetic as much as possible. A baby can be born sleepy or lethargic. This will wear off quickly.  
Prophylaxis against acid aspiration  
Almost 50% of airway deaths in GA for Cesarean section were due to pulmonary aspiration.

All patients should be considered to have a ‘full stomach’ from 16 weeks gestational age to 48 hours post-partum.

These patients are an aspiration risk due to reduced lower esophageal sphincter tone, caused by the effect of progesterone, and partially due to the physical effect of the gravid uterus on the stomach.  
We make the effort to reduce the volume and acidity of gastric contents.

GI Prophylaxis Meds  
Bicitra (sodium citrate) 30 mL 30–45 min prior to induction  
Pepcid (Famotidine) 20mg IV  
Reglan (Metoclopramide) 10mg IV (becoming controversial)  
Robinul 0.1mg  
Although anticholinergics (Robinul) can theoretically reduce lower esophageal tone, 0.1 mg Robinul helps reduce airway secretions and is useful incase a difficult airway situation arises.

Difficult airway The rate of difficult intubation with obstetric patients can be as high as 1 in 7.

Failed intubation is 10x more prevalent because:  
Increased fatty tissue  
Complete dentition  
Increased pharyngeal and laryngeal edema  
Large tongue  
Large breasts - may need moved out of the way

Always have a Glide Scope and/or difficult airway cart nearby. If you are in an emergency C-section with a difficult airway, you may be partly liable for lost time seeking a Glide Scope when seconds count. You never know.

Patient Awareness and 0.5 MAC vs 1 MAC  
In the past, many anesthesia providers had the fear of over sedating the fetus and reducing the contractility of the uterus by running their inhalation agents at half MAC. A higher incidence of awareness has been associated with general anesthesia for caesarean section.  
With a C-section with severe hypotension, we have no choice but to minimize our anesthetics, which may contribute to awareness. For severe hypotensive, you can always give ketamine.

A full MAC of volatile anesthetics can cause uterine relaxation and contribute to more bleeding. Literature states that 50% nitrous oxide with a low concentration of volatile gas can help minimize uterine relaxation. However, I have seen many anesthesia providers run a full MAC of inhalation agent on stable patients without any issues.

Many CRNAs administer 2mg of versed after the baby is out and cord is clamped (with stable patients).

Induction  
As stated earlier, you do not induce the patient until the abdomen is prepped, surgeon scrubbed and drapes are up.

Besides the patient being in the left lateral tilt to avoid aortocaval compression, some CRNAs prefer a 30º head-up for intubation. Head up may increase functional residual capacity (FRC), reduced breast interference to intubation, and reduce the GERD.

Pre-oxygenate  
With induction, these patients can quickly desaturate. Remember that these patients have a 40% reduction in their FRC with a 20% increase in O2 consumption. Oxygen reserves are rapidly depleted with induction. Always preoxygenate the patient with the minimal time you have prior to induction. Intubation should be rapid. Some studies have shown that 4 deep breaths in 30 seconds is identical to 5 minutes of normal breaths.

Induction Meds  
Most literature states that thiopental (5mg/kg lean body weight) is the preferred induction agent. Thiopental is no longer stocked in many hospital pharmacies.

Propofol and the muscle relaxant succinylcholine are currently the most popular drugs administered for induction with these procedures.

Etomidate or ketamine can safely in the presence of severe hypotension. Propofol is associated with slightly lower Apgar score.

Ketamine of 0.25 mg/kg maintains hemodynamic stability, but may also increase uterine tone and thus decrease placental blood flow if given in large doses.  
Many consider ketamine the drug of choice in pregnant women of questionable hemodynamic stability.

RSI: Yes (always cricoid pressure)  
Succinylcholine Dose (literature varies)  
Literature states a higher dose of succinylcholine should be administered due to the increased volume of distribution and relative resistance. At the same time, other literature states that the plasma cholinesterase activity may decrease up to 35% which may prolong the duration of succinylcholine and a lower dose should be considered. Most anesthesia providers’ bolus the full 200 mg of succinylcholine.

Should you administer a nondepolarizing muscle blocker (NDMB)?  
These cases are pretty quick and the patient should not require a relaxation. Remember cut time to delivery is usually 3 minutes. Most anesthesia provides do not administer them for these cases. If the surgeon request relaxation, make sure you use a minimal dose.

Narcotic and Benzodiazepines  
Fentanyl and versed can be given after the cord is clamped. Versed is really not needed if the volatile agent is > 0.5 MAC and it could slow your wake up.

Etomidate is usually not administered much used because it is painful on injection and may produce extrapyramidal/seizure-like activity.

OGT: Yes, an OGT may gently be inserted after the airway is secured.

Incision-Delivery Time  
For true emergencies, incision-delivery times greater than 180 seconds are associated with fetal acidosis and decreased 1 minute APGAR scores noted.

EBL: 400-700. More than regional anesthesia

Emergence  
Always perform an awake extubation as any patient with a high aspiration risk. Do not awake the patient until the OB team is pushing down on the fundus. This is very painful for the awake patient who has not had regional anesthesia.  
Remove the OGT just prior to extubation  
A TAP block can be performed prior to emergence.  
Awake extubation  
Some old literature states to extubate the patient in the lateral position. I have never seen any anesthesia provider extubate a general C-section in the lateral position. Supine is common.

Thromboprophylaxis  
Postpartum thromboembolism  
Postpartum thromboembolism is a significant cause of postoperative morbidity. After general anesthesia, postoperative heparin should be considered. Patient should already have had intraoperative calf compression and TEDS for intraoperative prophylaxis.

Risks and possible complication  
Unable to intubate/severe hypoxemia (permanent brain damage and death)  
Aspiration  
Respiratory depression in the newborn  
Infection  
Injury or damage to nerves  
Embolism  
Stroke, heart attack, arrhythmia and seizures  
Respiratory complications and pneumonia  
Breathing difficulties
