### Adrenalectomy for Non-Pheochromocytoma

Adrenalectomy is the surgical removal of one or both adrenal glands. They are paired endocrine glands and one is located above each kidney. They produce epinephrine, norepinephrine, androgens, estrogens, aldosterone, and cortisol.  
If this case is NOT involving a pheochromocytoma, it’s a standard case.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
**A- Line:** Should not be needed  
**Position:** Mostly lateral with surgical side up.  
**Laparoscopic:** Usually, they don’t do many open cases anymore.  
**Diagnosis:** Usually an adrenal mass.  
Despite minimal EBL, many still want an extra IV and type and cross for these patients.
