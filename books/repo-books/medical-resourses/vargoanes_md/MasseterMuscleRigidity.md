(Why it can be overlooked)  
_Muscular rigidity, especially in the jaw, is often the first sign of MH._Brief rigidity (< 20-30 seconds) is a normal response to Succinylcholine.  
Mild or transient MMR can occur after receiving Sevoflurane and Succinylcholine without any occurrence of malignant hyperthermia (MH).Generalized rigidity with MMR may not be present with MH.  
  
All patients who develop succinylcholine-induced MMR will experience rhabdomyolysis over the ensuing 24 hours_  
  
**Rigidity lasting longer than 1 minute is abnormal.**  
20-50% of these patients will develop MH within the next hour if they received Succinylcholine and patient’s jaw cannot be opened or the patient has peripheral muscle rigidity._When Succinylcholine-induced MMR occurs, elective surgery should be postponed. If the procedure is emergent, the anesthetic may continue with nontrigger agents.  
  
These patients should remain in the hospital and be monitored for signs of rhabdomyolysis such as myoglobinuria and myoglobinemia.  
  
CK levels and electrolytes should be checked every 8 hours until returning to normal.  
  
Patients who experience milder increases in jaw tension should be observed for signs and symptoms of MH for at least 12 hours.

If there is evidence of myoglobinuria, dark cola-colored urine, increase in temperature, pulse rate, and abnormality of acid base balance, the patient should be admitted and observed overnight.

The association of malignant hyperthermia and unusual disease: when you're hot you're hot or maybe not.
