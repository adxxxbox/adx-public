### Ventral (Abdominal) Hernia Repair with Mesh

It appears that many of these ventral hernias are from previous abdominal surgeries. Even after surgical repair, incisional hernias may return. Some ventral hernias can be congenital. Mesh is now added to most hernias.

**Is it laparoscopic or open?** That is the information you need. If it’s laparoscopic, then a half hour was just added to the case. Prepare and do the anesthesia like most other laparoscopic procedures.

**Open Abdominal Hernia Repair:** These are obviously easier and a little shorter in duration as compared to laparoscopic.

**Anesthesia:** General/ETT  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Yes  
**Positioning:** Supine, arms usually out.

**Duration:** 1-2 hours.  
**Blood Loss:** Minimal

**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable. 

  
**Emergence:** Avoid coughing with emergence. The surgeon does not want the incision challenged. Some surgeons will prefer an abdominal binder applied before or after emergence. These binders are tight and can cause some restriction with breathing.  
Deep extubation (if not contraindicated) is popular.

**Possible Complications**  
Infection involving the prosthetic biomaterial (mesh)  
Postoperative ileus seromas.  
DVT  
Dehiscence with profound coughing during emergence.
