### Benefits of hypothermia during cardiopulmonary bypass

The goal of myocardial protection using hypothermia is to prevent myocardial injury during the periods of intentional ischemia required during heart surgery.  
Hypothermia drastically reduces the myocardial metabolic requirements.  
  
1\. Decreases enzyme activity-reducing clearance of drugs.  
2\. Enhances myocardial preservation.  
3\. CNS (brain) is protected.  
  
Ventricular fibrillation results from a cardiac blood temperature of 25-30C.  
  
If the bypass machine had a malfunction, the tissue ischemic tolerance at normothermia is only 5-6 minutes. With blood temperature at 23C, it is 20-24 minutes.  
  
As the blood is cooled, there is an increase in the plasma oxygen content and a left shift in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve.  
  
The rule of seven describes the doubleing of the ischemic tolerance time of tissues. Every 7C reduction in temperature will double the ischemic tolerance.

| Temperature | Ischemic tolerance time |
| --- | --- |
| 37C (normothermic) | 5-6 minutes |
| 30C | 10-12 minutes |
| 23C | 20-24 minutes |
