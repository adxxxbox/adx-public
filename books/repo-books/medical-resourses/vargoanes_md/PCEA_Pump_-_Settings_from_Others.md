### PCEA Pump Settings from Others

PCEA (Patient Controlled Epidural Analgesia)

**Jennifer Smith Sealman CRNA**  
For Labor CLE/PCEA  
I use ropivacaine 0.2% + fentanyl 2mcg/mL  
  
**For 5'0" - 5'8"**  
6mL pump solution bolus then  
Basal 6 mL/hr  
4mL q 10 minute with a 10-minute lock out, 30 mL/1 hr max  
  
**For > 5'8"  
**Increase basal to 8mL and PCEA to 5 mLI was fairly skeptical that the lower dosage would give good coverage when I started at my hospital, but it really works well.  
Ropivacaine gives only a light motor block with a good sensory block. I can count on one hand the number of times I have to manage a block after placed (mine & my partners).  
  
**Joel Klunkel CRNA**  
**PCEA** :  
12 ml/hour, with a PCEA option of 8-10ml additional q 20 minutes  
max 12 within a 4 hour period (this is not used frequently though).  
  
**Asher Zelikson CRNA, North Dakota CRNA PCEA:  
**10 mLs/hr of 0.2% of Ropivacaine  
If I am called back to redose (which is rare), I use 8 mLs of 0.2% Ropivacaine and increase the basal rate to 12 mLs/hr.  
  
**Ryan McLain CRNA, Newman, GA CRNA  
My pump setting:** 8-12mL/hr, 5mL bolus q15min. All with 0.2 % Naropin (Ropivacaine).  
So many variables to this question and I do things differently a lot but this is how I run things the majority of the time.
