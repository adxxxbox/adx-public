Vitrectomy: Anterior or Posterior     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Vitrectomy: Anterior or Posterior

The removal of some or all of the vitreous humor from inside the eye. The vitreous humor makes up 2/3 of the volume of the eye. The Vitrectomy releases tension on the retina, allowing it to move back into proper position.

**Anterior Vitrectomy:** Just means that a small amount of the vitreous humor is removed from the front (anterior) of the eye. This is generally a complication during cataract surgery. The lens capsule was ruptured, allowing vitreous humor to move anteriorly. The vitreous that has moved into anterior segment must be removed to avoid further complications.

**Posterior Vitrectomy:** Removal of some or all of the vitreous humor from the deeper part of the eye. Posterior vitrectomies are usually performed in conjunction with other posterior segment surgeries including: Retinal detachments repair, epiretinal and interlimiting membrane peels, retinal hemorrhage repair and retinal laser treatments.

**Floaters:** Deposits floating around in the vitreous humor that can obstruct vision. Sometimes a Vitrectomy is performed to remove them. **Vitrectomies** are done in cases involving retinal detachments.  
**Diabetic Retinopathy** can form free floating blood vessels within the eye and a vitrectomy is needed to clear the bloody gel. The vitreous is replaced by the eye’s secretion of aqueous and nutritive fluids.

**Anesthetic:** Usually MAC with a Retrobulbar block  
Usually 2mg of Versed pre-op and Alfenta or Propofol just prior to the block. Don’t over sedate the patient because snoring is magnified through the microscope.  
**Duration:** 30-90 minutes.  
**IV Access**: 22G is acceptable. A 500mL NS bag with micro drip tubing is popular.  
Many of these patients are diabetic and very hypertensive.  
**Position:** Supine with arms tucked and the patient remains on the same stretcher. Make sure the ETCO2 NC is looped away from the surgical eye. The stretcher is parked 90-180 degrees away from you (unless you are starting out as a general).  
**EBL:** Minimal. Be careful giving Toradol. Some Vitrectomies are hemorrhage related.  
Many of these patients are diabetic and very hypertensive.

**Complications:**  
Cataract development  
Retinal detachment either during or after surgery.  
Infection  
Macular pucker may grow back, but this is rare.
