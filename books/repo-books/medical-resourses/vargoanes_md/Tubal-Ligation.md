### Tubal Ligation

A surgical procedure for female sterilization that involves severing and tying the fallopian tubes. Most are done laparoscopically.  
Some are done during a C-section while the uterus is out.  
Some are done 8 hours postpartum.  
Some are done in a newer method called Transcervical, which can be done in the doctor’s office.  

**Tubal Ligation Methods**

**Bipolar Coagulation:** The most popular. Odds of effective reversal of this procedure are about 70%.

**Fimbriectomy:** Removal of 1/3 of the Fallopian tube closest to the ovary. 

**Irving Procedure:** Done immediately after a C-section. The Fallopian tubes are divided and the proximal tube is buried within the myometrium on the anterior uterine surfaces near the round ligament. The distal tube section is buried between the folds of the broad ligament. As the uterus shrinks to its pre-gravid size, the buried ends of the tubes become more and more compressed and eventually will die.

**Monopolar Coagulation:** Less common than Bipolar Coagulation.

**Tubal Clip:** Reversal and pregnancy success is best with this procedure and can be as high as 85%.

**Tubal Ring:** An elastic loop placed in the Fallopian tube canal which blocks the ova’s passage from the ovary to the uterus.   

**Pomeroy Tubal Ligation:** Dr. Pomeroy invented this technique 100 years ago; it involves tying off a looped section of the Fallopian tube. Then the tied section is surgically removed.

**Essure Tubal Ligation:** (transcervical)  
In this method of tubal ligation, two small metal and fiber coils are placed in the fallopian tubes. After insertion, scar tissue forms around the coils, blocking off the fallopian tubes and preventing sperm from reaching the egg. This is done through the vagina. 

**Adiana Tubal Ligation:**  
In this method of tubal ligation, two small silicone pieces that are placed in the fallopian tubes. During the procedure, the surgeon heats a small portion of each fallopian tube and then inserts a tiny piece of silicone into each tube.
