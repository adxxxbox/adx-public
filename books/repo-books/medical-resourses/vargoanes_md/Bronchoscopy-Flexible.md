Flexible Bronchoscopy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Flexible Bronchoscopy

The flexible bronchoscope is generally used more often than the rigid bronchoscope because it usually does not require general anesthesia. It also goes deeper than a rigid bronchoscope. It can visualize the larynx, trachea, bronchi and bronchioles. The tube is very thin and about 2 feet long.  
**Functions:**

-   Biopsies
-   Removal of small foreign bodies
-   Tumor staging
-   Washouts
-   Diagnosis

  
We also use a Flexible Bronchoscopy for fiberoptic intubations or to verify double lumen endotracheal tube placement within the operating room.  
  
**Anesthetic: General/ETT or Deep MAC:  
**This is rarely done through an LMA or through a full Bi-pap Mask.  
Doing this case with only a deep MAC for us is a pain because you have to worry about a laryngeal spasm the entire time the doctor is maneuvering the scope. The doctors usually numb the cords, etc., but that does not always work. You should have an oral airway, intubation equipment and drugs handy in case the patient loses their airway.  
Sometimes you have to tell the doctor to pull out the scope and urgently insert an airway and aggressively mask ventilate the patient to bring their SaO 2 back up. Give Robinul ahead of time to dry their airway.  
**General: ETT;** as large as possible.  
**Endotubes:**  
<50kg and females: 8.0mm (check with doctor)  
Females >70kg and most males: 8.5mm  
All patients over >90kg: use a 9.0mm  
  
Many times the doctors request a 9.0mm ETT or 8.5mm ETT regardless the patient’s size.  
Try to always use at least an 8.5mm ETT or larger ETT if possible. The standard bronchoscope has issues with smaller ETTs. Hospitals usually have Pediatric bronchoscopes that work well with smaller ETTs. Many times a 9.0mm ETT is too large, so don’t force it. Also, the lung docs where we work have a fit if we don’t cut the ETT length. So we oblige by cutting the ETT down to the 25cm mark and re-attaching the ETT port. I have never seen a pulmonologist yet who told me that the 2-3cms I cut from the ETT made the difference for his ability to get to the mass or node or whatever; but most pulmonary docs are adamant about shortening the ETT length. Pick your battles. Cut the tube if you can.  
  
**LMA:** Rare, but some doctors prefer them. Make sure you have an adequate seal and your patient does not have a large belly. An LMA is also common if the patient’s glottis is too narrow for an 8.0mm ETT. However, it is usually more difficult to ventilate the patient with an LMA during a bronchoscopy.  
**Bi-pap with a full facemask:** Also rare. Respiratory brings the Bi-pap equipment and mask. We usually use a Propofol infusion. A bronchoscopy swivel is used with the Bi-pap mask.  
**Cocktail:** Usually give 2mg Versed and 2cc of Fentanyl.  
**Relaxant:** Succinylcholine, optional.  
_  
Many anesthesia providers administer rocuronium and can conveniently reverse with sugammadex, despite the procedure time.  
This eliminates intraoperative coughing, intermittent dosing of propofol and requiring a higher MAC._  
  
**LTA Kit:** Yes, or the doctor will numb their cords. Cetacaine spray tastes horrible! Try it sometimes. So I ask the staff not to use it on a patient who is having an anesthetic. Some patients undergo these Bronchs with ‘local with sedation.’ Then the sedation RN will coat their throats with Cetacaine before sedation begins.  
**Propofol Infusion:** Yes, either manually or use a pump and titrate to effect. Sevoflurane used alone will usually not prevent the patient from gagging once the Anectine is metabolized.  
**Narcotics:** Keep minimal because these procedures could be pretty quick. Keep the patent deeper with Propofol because it is a shorter acting drug than fentanyl.  
  
**Duration:** 5-30 minutes.**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
**The main risks from bronchoscopy:**

-   Bleeding from biopsy sites.
-   Infection
-   Laryngospasms (MAC case)

**There is also a small risk of:**

-   Arrhythmias
-   Breathing difficulties
-   Fever
-   Heart attack in people with existing heart disease.
-   Low blood oxygen
-   Pneumothorax
-   Sore throat
