### Liver Resection (Hepatectomy)

  
The surgical removal of a portion of the liver.

This is a large open belly case. Most incisions are a trans-abdominal approach.  
**Indications**: Hepatic neoplasms, both benign and/or malignant. Benign neoplasms include hepatocellular adenomas, hepatic hemangiomas and focal nodular hyperplasias. The most common malignant neoplasms (cancers) of the liver are metastases. Those arising from colorectal cancer are the most common, and the most amenable to surgical resection.

The most common primary malignant tumor of the liver is the hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatectomy may also be the procedure of choice to treat intrahepatic gallstones or parasitic cysts of the liver.

**Pre-Op**: Labs: CBC, BMP, Coag profile and blood sugar.  
Type and Cross with 2 units of PRBCs on standby.  
Epidural.  

  
**Anesthetic**: General/ETT/RSI  
Epidurals are common for post op pain, unless the patient has a coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia.  
**IV Access:** 2 large bore IVs  
**Duration:** 2-4 hours  
**EBL:** 250-750mLs  
**Central Line/CVP:** Usually, not always.  
During liver resection, **EBL** correlates with the CVP.  
CVP < 5cmH20 is associated with **EBL** < 200mLs.  
CVP > 5cmH20 is associated with **EBL** > 1,000mLs.  
Ask the surgeon where he wants the CVP. Remember, you still need adequate renal perfusion pressure and flow throughout the case.  
**A-line:** Yes  
**Position:** Supine  
**Foley:** Yes, maintain urine output at 0.5-1cc/kg/hr and to the extent of blood loss.  
**Albumin:** Commonly given in these cases.

**Fluid**: 0.9% NSS is preferred with a compromised liver because the liver has difficulty metabolizing the lactate ion with LR. However, we still mostly use LR. Keep the patient dry; this helps limit the EBL.  
**Nitroglycerine Drip:** Can be used to lower the CVP.

**Intermittent Pringle Maneuver**: A technique to minimize blood loss during parts of hepatic surgery is by clamping the inflow of blood to the liver via the hepatic artery and portal vein.  
Clamping the hepato-duodenal ligament blocks the hepatic inflow, which leads to a non circulating splanchnic outflow. Clamp times are usually 10 minutes. Sometimes the surgeon will clamp the portal vein and the supra-infrahepatic inferior vena cava. This causes a more profound hemodynamic change than portal clamping alone. Although both the SVR and HR increase, the cardiac index is reduced by half, secondary to a steep reduction in preload.

**Fluid warmer and warming blanket**: Yes, hypothermia inhibits the enzymes of the coagulation cascade and contributes to intraoperative blood loss.  
Intra-op Labs: ABGs, CBC, BMP and Coags to get a better feel where the patient is.  

**Notes**: Approximately 20% of otherwise healthy patients may experience postoperative complications after elective liver resections. The most frequent of these are pulmonary infection and abdominal abscesses, both usually responsive to antibiotic therapy.  
  
The liver is divided into two lobes and further subdivided into eight segments.  
The basic principle of liver surgery is to remove the tumor with negative margins while preserving enough remaining liver—as well as blood flow in and out of the liver—to maintain liver function.  
  
**Segmentectomy, wedge resection, lobectomy**  
For tumors in the periphery of the liver, either a single **segmentectomy** (surgical removal of one of the liver’s eight segments) or **wedge resection** (removal of the tumor along with some surrounding liver tissue) is often adequate.  
  
For larger tumors or more centrally located lesions, a formal right or left hepatic **lobectomy** (removal of one of the liver’s two lobes) may be required.  
  
**The liver grows back  
**The liver is unique in that after the diseased portion has been excised, the remaining functioning portion will hypertrophy (regrow) to help restore normal function of the liver. This regrowth can happen in as little as 2 to 3 weeks, and this is one of the reasons that even large portions of the liver may be aggressively removed.
