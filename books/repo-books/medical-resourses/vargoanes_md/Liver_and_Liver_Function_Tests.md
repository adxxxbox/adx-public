LFTs are slightly elevated, which is normal.  
Serum proteins are decreased, increasing the potency of certain medications.  
Coagulation factors increase.  
Serum albumin - lower  
Transaminases (AST and ALT) – lower  
Bilirubin - lower  
Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) - increased in the third trimester due to placental production of ALP.  
ALP is produced in the bones, kidneys, and small intestine in addition to the liver and placenta. In the parturient, elevated levels could also be caused by HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets).  
  
**Other Possible Causes of Increased ALP**  
Intrahepatic cholestasis  
Malignancy  
Primary liver or bone disease  
  
**Plasma Cholinesterase and Succinylcholine**  
Plasma Cholinesterase activity starts to decrease at the 10th week of pregnancy.  
A 33% maximal reduction can occur up to the third postpartum day. This is from a reduced synthesis by the liver combined with hemodilution. Activity has to be reduced by 50% for an increased sensitivity to succinylcholine. Some literature states that higher dose of succinylcholine should be administered due to the increased volume of distribution and relative resistance. At the same time, other literature states that the plasma cholinesterase activity may decrease up to 35% which may prolong the duration of succinylcholine and a lower dose should be considered.  
  
**HELLP Syndrome and Succinylcholine**  
More than 60% of HELLP Syndrome patients have a decreased level of  
pseudocholinesterase activity. The duration of succinylcholine may be prolonged.
