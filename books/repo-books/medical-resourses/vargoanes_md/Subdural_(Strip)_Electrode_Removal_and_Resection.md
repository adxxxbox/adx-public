### Subdural (Strip) Electrode Removal and Resection

_Please review “Subdural (Strip) Electrode Insertion.”  
  
_The cranial resection depends on the location within the brain tissue where the origin of seizure activity is located (epileptogenic focus).  
Pre-op communication with the surgeon is important because the resection may be small and very superficial with little predicted blood loss and may even require an arterial line.  
  
These patients are usually 1-2 weeks post op from the initial electrode insertions.  
  
The patient will be positioned as appropriate for the location of resection. The skin flap is removed followed by removal of electrodes. The resection will be performed similarly to any other tissue resection.  
Brain swelling must be avoided as the surgeon will need to apply the bone flap instead of the initial pliable skin flap.  
  
**Pre-op:**  
Treated as a craniotomy procedure unless the resection is to be very superficial with predicted minimal blood loss.  
  
**Pre-op preparation**  
Extra syringe of propofol if the surgeon is utilizing Mayfield pins.  
**Anesthesia:** General/ETT  
**Induction:** RSI not usually required  
**Nitrous:** Not indicated**Muscle Relaxation:** Yes**Positioning:** Depends on the location of resection.  
_The patient will have a soft spot over the skin flap where part of the cranium was removed. Application of pressure to that area must be avoided._  
Arms are tucked. It is good to connect a phenylephrine drip to an IV port before the arms are tucked.  
Sufficient slack must be present in all monitoring cords and infusion lines to allow for rotation of the operating table.  
  
**IV Access:** 1-2. Most the time we insert 2 IVs since the arms are tucked and we have a backup.  
**Arterial line:** Usually, unless resection is very superficial.  
**Duration:** Depends on location.  
**EBL:** depends on location. Consider typing and cross-matching blood if the resection is not superficial.  
Hydration: Excessive hydration is avoided in order to avoid brain swelling.**Emergence:** Neurologic checks may be required immediately following emergence. This must be determined before deciding on deep extubation.Most patients are returned to the neurosurgical ICU.

**Possible complications  
**Hemorrhage  
Infection  
Headaches  
Orbital swelling
