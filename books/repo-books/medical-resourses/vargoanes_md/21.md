### When is Cardioplegia Delivered?

As soon as the ascending aorta has been cross-clamped, blood cardioplegia is initiated through the aortic root. Cardiac arrest is achieved within 1 minute of aortic cross-clamping. As soon as the heart is arrested, the cardioplegia line is switched to a retrograde coronary sinus catheter, and the flow rate of the pump is reduced. There will now be a continuous delivery of cardioplegia during the remainder of the cross-clamping period.
