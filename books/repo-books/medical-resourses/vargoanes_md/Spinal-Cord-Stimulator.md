Spinal Cord Stimulator Placement     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Spinal Cord Stimulator Placement

A spinal cord stimulator is an implanted device (looks like a pacemaker) that sends low levels of electricity directly into the spinal cord to relieve pain.  
It is used most often after nonsurgical pain treatment options have failed to provide sufficient relief.  
Most of these patients are tolerant to narcotics

**Pre-op:**  
First you need to find out what the surgeon’s plan is. Most of these patients need to be awake enough in the prone position to communicate with the pain surgeon during lead placement. After that, you can deepen the patient for the implantation of the generator.

Most of these are chronic pain patients with a high tolerance to narcotics.  
Assess the airway and for a history of OSA. Remember, the patient is most likely to be prone; not a good position if you need to go to sleep. You will need to make the patient deeper for the 2nd half of the case for the generator insertion. Many of these pain docs are anesthesiologists and will tell you EXACTLY what they want, including drugs and dosages.  
   
**Anesthesia:** MAC or General.  
Ketamine and Propofol are popular for the 2nd half of the case for the generator placement.  
Use a NC with ETCO2. I’ve seen some surgeons tell us just to intubate; starting with a general endotracheal intubation and not requiring patient communication.

**If the surgeon needs to communicate with the patient:**

Use minimal Versed to none at all. Many pain docs want the patient mentally clear during lead placement. When the doctor makes an incision, the patient will need to be temporarily deep. Whatever short acting drugs you are administering, turn them off or withhold them when the doctor starts making the incision. This gives time for the patient to be awake and mentally clear to verify placement. Most of us use Propofol.  
 

**Duration:** 1-2 hours. The proper lead placement takes most of this time.

**Position:** Usually prone. If it is in prone position and the patient will be awake for part or all of the case, let the patient position him/her self with a head turned either left or right on the pillow. There should also be some pillows below the chest or abdomen.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable. Avoid the AC site because the arms of the patient will probably be flexed in the prone position.

  
**More Notes and Facts you should know:**

Initially, the spinal cord stimulator trial is done in the doctor’s office. The leads are percutaneously placed under fluoroscopy and the patient collaborates with the surgeon. The leads are then pulled out to prevent infection and the patient goes home.

About a month later, the patient comes to the hospital for a permanent **spinal cord stimulator placement.**

For the permanent placement, the patient is still awake for another trial to verify placement, then the patient is heavily sedated the rest of the case while the surgeon creates a subcutaneous pocket and implants the stimulator.  
With trials, the patient is awake. Trials are always awake because it provides immediate feedback to the surgeon regarding stimulation-induced paresthesia.  

Neurostimulators that are connected to the leads will send mild electrical impulses to the spine. These impulses replace pain with a tingling sensation. Neurostimulators are implanted in the upper buttocks or abdomen.

A trial is used to find out if this treatment will reduce pain. The trial most often lasts one week.  If the trial is successful in relieving pain, a permanent device can be placed under the skin on another day.

For percutaneously insertion, the surgeon uses epidural needles. This method is much less stimulating than making small deep incisions.

**Lead Placement:** The surgeon inserts 2 leads catheters that looks like one catheter called a Paddle Lead up into an epidural space. The electrodes are positioned over the spinous process. Once the leads are advanced to where the doctor thinks they should be, the doctor will start intraoperative testing with the patient, verbally communicating while insertion adjustments are being made. Insertion point is verified under fluoroscopy by the C-arm.

The patient needs to be awake and able to locate the paresthesia as precise lead placement determines success.  
 

**During the 1st half of case**: Usually just give Propofol.  Hopefully the surgeon localized the patient deep with a spinal needle. Whatever you give, the patient better be awake and coherent enough in time when the surgeon is ready to start communicating with patient on lead placement.

  
**During the 2nd half of the case:**

After proper lead placement is verified, the doctor’s next task will be to make another incision and create a pocket for the generator placement. You can now put the patient to sleep.  
**Popular Cocktail for 2nd half of the case:**

50mg of ketamine IV push and then start a standard Propofol drip.

Start Propofol/ketamine at a low dose: usually 50mg ketamine in 500mg of Propofol.

 Just remember your patient is prone and DON’T LOSE YOUR AIRWAY!!

Biggest failure is electrode migration.  For pain in the lower extremities and lower back, the stimulator electrode implant by Medtronic is placed between T-9 and L-1 over the lower end of the spinal cord. Placement of the spinal cord stimulator implant is usually done with a local anesthetic, and intravenous sedation.

Spinal cord stimulation provides pain relief by modifying the pain messages before they reach the brain. The neurostimulator sends out mild electrical impulses that reach the brain faster than the pain signal can arrive. In other words, it outsmarts your back and leg pain. Instead of feeling pain, you feel a tingling sensation.

**Possible Complications:**   
Bleeding  
Infection  
Paralysis or weakness.  
Spinal fluid leakage.  
Worsened pain.  
Stimulation that stops or only works intermittently.  
Stimulation affecting the wrong location.  
Overstimulation  
Poor system connection.  
Device malfunctions that require a revision surgery.  
The lead may move or become damaged, requiring surgical repositioning or removal.  
Device interactions with other tests/devices: for example, a Pacemaker.
