### Classification of Heart Failure (HF)

**New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of HF:**  
It is based on the patient's functional status at a particular time.  
The functional status may worsen or improve.  
It is intended for patients with structural heart disease and symptoms of HF.  
It is useful because the severity of the symptoms positively correlates with the quality of life and survival.  
  
**Four functional NYHA HF classes:**  
**Class I:** Ordinary physical activity does not cause symptoms.  
**Class II:** Symptoms occur with ordinary exertion.  
**Class III:** Symptoms occur with less-than-ordinary exertion.  
**Class IV:** Symptoms occur at rest.  
  
**The 2005 ACC/AHA classification of HF:**  
This classification is meant to be complementary to the NYHA classification and to be used in guiding therapy.  
  
**It stratifies patients into four disease stages:**  
**Stage A:** High risk of HF, but without structural heart disease or symptoms of HF.  
**Stage B:** Presence of structural heart disease but without symptoms of HF  
**Stage C:** Presence of structural heart disease with previous or current symptoms of HF.  
**Stage D:** Presence of refractory HF that requires specialized interventions.
