### Liposuction and Anesthesia

_Please review “Liposuction Notes”_  
**  
Preoperative assessment  
**Consider the risk that the effects of epinephrine utilized during the liposuction procedure adversely affect patients with CAD and/or cardiac issues.**  
  
Contraindications**  
Severe cardiovascular disease  
Coagulation disorder  
Pregnancy  
  
Review and document any medications that may affect coagulation including herbs and nutritional supplements with anticoagulant effects.  
Most of these drugs should be stopped at least 2 weeks before surgery.  
  
**Discontinue medications that may affect lidocaine metabolism  
**Calcium channel blockers  
Statins  
  
**Pre-op Labs  
**CBC  
Quantitative platelet assessment  
PT/aPTT  
Liver function test  
Pregnancy test when applicable  
  
**Premedicate  
**Analgesics are becoming more frequently used in order to limit opioids.  
Plastic surgeons DO NOT favor the use of ketorolac (Toradol®).  
Anxiolysis with a benzodiazepine is common.  
Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is used as perioperative thromboprophylaxis for obese patients.  
_It is good to know the type of liposuction the surgeon utilizes.  
If the surgeon uses“high volume” liposuction, fluid administration must be carefully monitored._  
  
**Anesthesia  
**Depends on the site and the extent of liposuction and also patient preference.  
The anesthetic technique will vary according to the areas being liposuctioned, depending upon whether any or a combination of arms, thighs, abdomen, or buttocks are treated, and the upon volume of fat being removed.  
  
**Monitored anesthesia care or light sedation  
**In “small volume” liposuction technique, there is infiltration with a solution containing a vasoconstrictor and lidocaine, which reduces bleeding and provides intraoperative analgesia.  
This technique permits a MAC or light sedation.  
  
**  
Common meds for MAC cases  
Common medications for MAC cases  
**Midazolam 1-3 mg  
Fentanyl: 25-50 mg  
Propofol (0.5-1 mg/kg) may be given intermittently  
Ketamine may be added in low doses  
Regional anesthesia is optional, but not commonly utilized with plastic procedures.  
  
**General anesthesia**  
This is recommended for large volume liposuction or if the patient desires it.  
LMA is the most common for patients who will be positioned supine or laterally.  
Liposuction of buttocks and back of the thighs requires prone position and these patients are usually intubated.  
Muscle relaxation is generally not required.  
  
**Monitoring**  
For small volume liposuction, standard ASA monitoring is common.  
Large volume liposuction is rarely performed anymore due to complications.  
Invasive monitoring such as central venous pressure and arterial blood pressure are required for large volume liposuction.  
  
**Foley catheter:** Recommended for very long procedures.  
  
**Hydration  
**The goal is to replace the preoperative deficit and provide maintenance fluid.  
Plastic surgeons rarely utilize large volumes anymore due to the risks of fluid overloading he patient.  
The majority of this residual volume of wetting solution slowly gets absorbed into the intravascular compartment.  
  
_In 1996, Trott et al . suggested guidelines for intraoperative fluid resuscitation.  
Patients having < 4,000 ml of liposuction aspirate removed received maintenance fluid only.  
Patients having more than that volume removed received maintenance plus 0.25 ml of intravenous fluid for each milliliter aspirated over 4,000 ml._  
  
_The intraoperative fluid volume ratio (volume of intravenous fluid plus infiltration solution divided by aspirate volume) was 2.1 for small-volume liposuction (<4,000 ml) and 1.4 for large volume liposuction (>4,000 ml). With this fluid management strategy, the patients appeared to be slightly overhydrated._  
  
Vigilance is required so as not to contribute to the risk.  
**Intraoperative fluid administration  
Total input:**  
Intravenous fluids  
Volume of wetting solution injected  
  
**Total output:  
**Urine output  
Aspirated fluid (fat, blood and a portion of wetting solution)  
  
**Residual volume:**  
Difference between the fluid input and output-that remains in the patient.  
The majority remains in the extravascular compartment. This fluid, which acts like an interstitial infusion, slowly gets absorbed into the intravascular compartment. Thus, any excess fluid administered can easily produce fluid overload, which is an important cause for morbidity in these patients.  
  
**Estimating blood loss:  
Dry Technique:** There is no infiltration of fluid  
EBL is 20-45% of the aspirated volume  
  
**Wet Technique:** 200-300 ml of volume is injected per area of treatment regardless of how much is aspirated.  
EBL: is 4-30% of aspirated volume.  
**Superwet Technique:** 1 ml is equally injected per 1 ml of aspirated fat removed.  
Blood loss is approximately 4-30% of the aspirated volume.  
  
**Tumescent Technique (** combination of tumescent infiltration and lidocaine)  
One study showed that mean amount of blood loss per liter of aspirate was around 10.5 ± 5.2 ml.  
  
If in doubt, check a hematocrit.  
  
**Pain relief  
**Analgesia is provided by the lidocaine in tumescent liposuction, so the requirement for analgesics in the intraoperative and postoperative period is minimal.  
By adding epinephrine to lidocaine, the duration of analgesia obtained from tumescent lidocaine can be extended by many hours.  
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may also be prescribed for postoperative pain relief.  
  
**Early ambulation will minimize the risk of DVT and pulmonary embolus  
**Patients are asked to begin ambulation as soon as possible. Early lower extremity muscle-contracting exercises are to be encouraged while in bed to minimize the risk of DVT and pulmonary embolus.  
  
Prolonged liposuction surgery significantly increases the risk of pulmonary emboli (thrombi, fluid or fat), fluid overload, excessive bleeding, and serious infections.  
  
**Complications  
**The complications depend on the technique used.  
Complications are more prevalent when large volume liposuction is performed under general anesthesia or is combined with other major procedures like abdominoplasty.  
Hypothermia  
Thromboembolism  
Pulmonary fat embolism syndrome  
Pulmonary edema  
Lidocaine toxicity  
Hemorrhage  
Abdominal viscus perforation  
Sepsis including necrotizing fasciitis  
ARDS  
Anesthesia complications  
  
The incidence is highest when performed in a physician's office, followed by ambulatory surgery centers, and is least in the hospital operating rooms.  
The incidence of mortality associated with liposuction is reported to be 0.003-0.02%.  
  
**Pulmonary fat embolism syndrome**  
Patients undergoing liposuction surgery are subject to a shower of fat particles being dislodged during surgery, resulting in pulmonary fat embolism syndrome.  
  
Pulmonary edema and over-hydration have been attributed to absorption of the tumescent solution from subcutaneous to the intravascular compartment.  
This is most often seen with large-volume liposuction.  
  
**Patient must be closely monitored for arrhythmias and lidocaine toxicity**  
Large doses of lidocaine may impair cardiac contraction and conduction, resulting in fatal arrhythmias. Arrhythmias may also be due to the addition of epinephrine if the circulating levels are high.  
  
While addition of epinephrine to the wetting solution produces virtually a bloodless field, it may produce arrhythmias if the circulating levels are high.  
  
**More Notes  
**With tumescent fluid alone (no lidocaine) about a quarter or 3 – 4 pounds of fat can be removed and the rest is numbing fluid.  
  
With MAC anesthesia, about 6 – 7 pounds of fat can be removed and the rest is numbing fluid.  
  
With general anesthesia – about 9 – 10 pounds of fat can be removed because very little numbing fluid needs to be used.  
  
Almost all liposuction deaths that have ever been reported have been associated with general anesthesia.  
In most cases, general anesthesia was not the proximate cause of harm but an indirect cause because it permitted the surgeon to do an excessive amount of liposuction, or to do multiple unrelated surgical procedures during the same operation.  
  
Prolonged and excessive surgery significantly increases the risk of blood clots in the lung, fluid overload, excessive bleeding, and serious infections. The true danger of systemic anesthesia is it is more difficult to decide when a patient has had too much surgery.  
**Modified Tumescent Technique  
**Liposuction by the combination of tumescent infiltration and general anesthesia is commonly known by any of the following names:  
Superwet technique or modified tumescent technique for liposuction.  
These names refer to the same liposuction technique which consists of the following:

1.  a relatively small volume of tumescent infiltration,
2.  some form of anesthesia, and
3.  significant volume of IV fluid supplementation.
