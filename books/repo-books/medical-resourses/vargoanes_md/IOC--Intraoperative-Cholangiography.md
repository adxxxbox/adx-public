### Intraoperative Cholangiography or IOC

An IOC is the reason we always REVERSE the bed prior to a cholecystectomy. The C-arm for fluoroscopy cannot be properly positioned for an IOC in the typical (older) operating room bed while the bed is in the standard position. IOCs are not a common procedure, but many of them are performed during a laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy. 

In the middle of the case, the doctor inserts a small catheter into the cystic duct before any structures are divided to avoid common duct injury.  
  
**Note:** The Cystic duct drains bile from the gallbladder into the common bile duct.  
A contrast dye is then injected into the bile duct via a thin catheter wire to visualize the flow pathway via C-arm fluoroscopy. This allows the surgeon to see the total “bile duct system” from the liver to the small intestine. A stone is suspected if there is an obstruction of flow.

Just prior to the IOC, you will be asked to level the bed and the surgeon will inject the dye with a large syringe. The surgeon will review the C-arm results and resume with the case by removing the gallbladder.

An IOC is recommended especially in difficult cases and with unclear biliary anatomy. If the bile duct is not properly identified and accidentally perforated, a nasty bile leak follows. When an unrecognized damaged bile duct leak occurs, it causes peritonitis within 5 to 7 days following surgery. This requires a temporary biliary stent via ERCP. It’s important for the surgeon to recognize the early symptoms because peritonitis is associated with significant perioperative morbidity and mortality. 

Aggressive pain management and antibiotic therapy should be initiated as soon as a perforated bile duct is diagnosed.

**Complications:**  
Patient allergic to dye.   
Infection and bleeding.  
Inflammation of the pancreas with resultant pancreatitis.  
Damage to the common bile duct.  
 

Sometimes the surgeon will request you to administer Glucagon. So you should have some available.
