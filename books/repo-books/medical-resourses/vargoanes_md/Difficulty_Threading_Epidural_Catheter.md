### Difficulty Threading Epidural Catheter

_Edited by: Jennifer Garris MS, CRNA_

-   NEVER withdraw a catheter from a needle once it has exited the needle tip for fear of possible shearing.
-   Have patient take a deep breath as you advance the catheter.
-   Add an additional 4-5 ml saline into space.
-   Decrease the angle of insertion by pulling the hub caudally.
-   Withdraw the needle 1-2 cm and try to advance again.
-   If unsuccessful, withdraw and attempt at another interspace.
