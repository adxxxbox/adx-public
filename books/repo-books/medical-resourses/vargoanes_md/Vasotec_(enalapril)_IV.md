### Vasotec (enalapril maleate)

**Generic Name:** enalapril

**Brand Name:** Vasotec

**Drug Class:** Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)

More commonly, it is an oral medication, but sometimes indicated intravenously perioperatively.

**Anesthesia precautions with ACEI- or ARB-induced refractory hypotension:**

We generally suggest patients stop taking ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or direct renin inhibitors 24 hours before undergoing anesthesia to reduce the risk of anesthesia-induced intraoperative hypotension.

These patients may be refractory to ephedrine and phenylephrine but become responsive after a single dose of vasopressin.

**Possible indications:**

When patients are refractory to Labetalol and contraindicated to Hydralazine.

When the maximum dose of Nicardipine is reached.

**IV dose:**

1.25 mg/dose IV over 5 minutes Q 6 hours;

Doses up to 5 mg IV Q 6 hours have been administered.

**PO doses:**

**Initial:** 2.5-5 mg PO qDay

**Maintenance:** 10-40 mg/day PO qDay or divided q12hr

**ACE inhibitors are effective for:**

Control of blood pressure

Congestive heart failure and

Prevention of stroke and hypertension or diabetes-related kidney damage

**Mechanism of action:**

ACE inhibitors dilate arteries and veins by competitively inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II (a potent endogenous vasoconstrictor) and by inhibiting bradykinin metabolism; these actions result in preload and afterload reductions on the heart

ACE inhibitors also promote sodium and water excretion by inhibiting angiotensin-II induced aldosterone secretion; elevation in potassium may also be observed.

ACE inhibitors also elicit renoprotective effects through vasodilation of renal arterioles.

ACE inhibitors reduce cardiac and vascular remodeling associated with chronic hypertension, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.

**Contraindications:**

\- Hypersensitivity to enalapril/other ACE inhibitors

\- History of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema, hereditary or idiopathic angioedema

\- Coadministration of neprilysin inhibitors (e.g., sacubitril) with ACE inhibitors may increase angioedema risk; do not administer ACE inhibitors within 36 hr of switching to or from sacubitril/valsartan

\- Do not coadminister aliskiren in patients with diabetes mellitus or with renal impairment (i.e., GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m²)

\- Bilateral renal artery stenosis

**Avoid with pregnancy:**

This drug can cause serious fetal harm (sometimes death) if used during the last six months of pregnancy.

**Lactation:**

Enalapril and enalaprilat have been detected in human breast milk.

1-10%

**Absorption (PO):**

**Bioavailability:** 60%

**Duration:** 6 hours (IV), 12-24 hr (PO)

**Peak plasma time:** 15 minutes (IV), 1 hour (PO)

**Onset of action:**

**Initial response for hypertension:** 15 min (IV), 1 hr (PO)

**Peak response for hypertension:** 1-4 hr (IV), 4-6 hr (PO)

**Distribution**

**Protein-bound:** 50-60%

**Metabolism:**

Liver (70%); enalapril undergoes hepatic biotransformation to enalaprilat within 4 hours following oral administration

**Metabolites:** Enalaprilat (active)

**Elimination:**

**Half-life elimination:** 2 hours (parent drug)

35-38 hours (active metabolite \[enalaprilat\])

**Dialyzable:** Yes (hemodialysis)

**Excretion:** Urine (61%); feces (6% as enalapril, 27% as enalaprilat)
