Atropine Induced Paradoxical Bradycardia (AIPB)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Atropine Induced Paradoxical Bradycardia (AIPB)

AIPB is sinus bradyarrhythmia following low-dose atropine resulting from the paradoxical slowing in the sinoatrial (SA) node discharge rate.  
  
**Cause:** Atropine dose < 0.5 mg  
  
**Physiology:**  
Central vagotonic effect (blocking M1 acetylcholine receptors in parasympathetic ganglion controlling SA node) of atropine which, at higher doses, is masked by muscarinic (M2 acetylcholine receptors) blockade at the sinoatrial node.  
The initial low dose of atropine may not be sufficient to ensure adequate peak concentration in peripheral tissues.  
  
**Can a low dose of Scopolamine cause AIPD?** Yes  
Low doses of Scopolamine (0.1-0.2 mg) usually cause more heart rate slowing than atropine.
