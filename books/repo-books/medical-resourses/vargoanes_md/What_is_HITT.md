# What is HITT?

**What is HITT (**Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis also White Clot Disorder.  
HITT is pretty much the same as HIT-EXCEPT there is also a systemic platelet activation causing formation of white platelet clots (thrombosis).  
HITT is the most dangerous form of HIT

**Alternative anticougulants:** Lepirudin, argatroban and warfarin

If the symptoms of HIT or HITT are serious enough to discontinue the Heparin, one of the alternative anticoagulants -**lepirudin** or **argatroban** will be needed to suppress any new thrombosis while the formation of antibodies is halted and the platelet count recovers. Warfarin (or similar vitamin K inhibitor drug) is contraindicated with HIT because there is a very high risk of warfarin necrosis seen with these patients.Transfusing platelets is discouraged, as there is a theoretical risk that this may worsen the risk of thrombosis; the platelet count is rarely low enough to be the principal cause of significant hemorrhage.
