### Tubal Ligation (Postpartum) Notes and Facts

Epidural, spinal, or general anesthesia can be provided effectively. Postpartum Tubal Ligation used to be at 24-48 hours, but now with shorter hospital stays, 8 hours is becoming more common.  
Within 8 hours of delivery, a BTL is reasonable when the maternal medical history is uncomplicated and if the delivery was devoid of significant complications.  
  
A postpartum tubal ligation within 8 hours of delivery does not increase maternal complications. Ultrasound studies have shown evidence of solid food in postpartum patients at least 6 hours after delivery despite being NPO.

Because the uterine fundus is located at the level of the umbilicus, access to the fallopian tubes is facilitated through a small sub-umbilical incision.

**Laparoscopic or Mini-laparotomy Technique**  
Experienced surgeons usually perform a Mini-laparotomy.

**Mini-laparotomy**  
The surgeon makes a small sub-umbilical incision, finds the round ligament, grabs it with a babcock and uses it to pull the uterus up and expose the fallopian tubes. Obesity does not seem to be a factor.  
Some surgeons will make sure the bladder is empty. If it’s really full, it can move the tubes up away from the incision.

**Laparoscopic**  
Still common, but it increases aspiration risks if they are not intubated.

**Conflicting reports on how long epidurals last after delivery.**  
One study looked at epidural reactivation after delivery. It found that 93% of catheters were functional for postpartum tubal ligation within 1–4 hours of delivery. Only 68% of epidural catheters, however, were functional during hours 5-8 after delivery. Some studies showed a longer duration. So dose the catheter and make sure it still works.  
   
**Delayed Gastric Emptying**  
May persist during the early postpartum period. Intrapartum opioids, diabetes or obesity are contributing factors. Bicitra, Reglan and Pepcid are frequently administered pre-op.  

The patient must have been NPO during labor and postpartum until the time of surgery.

Many physiologic changes of pregnancy are resolving in the early postop period. However, complete resolution does not fully occur until approximately 6 weeks postpartum. Clear liquids may be continued until 2 hours before the procedure. Aspiration prophylaxis should be considered.

**Spinal Anesthesia:**  
Keep in mind that spinal anesthetic dose requirements are decreased during pregnancy.  
Requirements return to non-pregnant levels at 36-48 hours after delivery.  
  
**Spinal Doses:**  
Either Bupivacaine or Lidocaine is acceptable choices. Hyperbaric 5% Lidocaine 1.4 to 1.6cc or hyperbaric 0.75% Bupivacaine 1.0 to l.4cc seems to be adequate for sensory block to T4. Adding lipid-soluble opioids, such as fentanyl, may improve the efficacy of smaller doses of Bupivacaine.
