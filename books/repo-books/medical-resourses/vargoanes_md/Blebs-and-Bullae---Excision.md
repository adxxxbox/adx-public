### Blebs and Bullae – Excision

Blebs or bullae are thin walled balloon-like extensions or air sacs. Singularly, they are bulla, but plural is bullae. They are also called pulmonary cysts. These cysts, blebs or bullae are sacs in the lung tissue that are filled with air or gas. Blebs or bullae are prone to rupture at any time causing a spontaneous pneumothorax. Large Blebs may require a Thoracotomy for removal. Smaller Blebs can be removed via VATs.

**Anesthesia: General with a Left Double Lumen Tube:**  
_\[Refer to Thoracotomy or VATs Notes\]_  
It is very rare to utilize a single lumen ETT for this procedure. If you use a single lumen tube, you will experience elevated peak pressures and may need to switch to control ventilation.  
**Nitrous Oxide:** Avoid it because could expand the bullae.  
**Ventilation:** Avoid elevated peak pressures. Ruptured Bullae could cause a tension pneumothorax. You may want to consider pressure control ventilation immediately after intubation.

**Duration:** 1-3 hours  
  
**Complications:**  
Horner Syndrome (Ptosis, miosis, enopthalmos and anhydrosis).  
Damaged vocal cords from the Double Lumen Tube.  
Hemorrhage  
Trauma to surrounding organs
