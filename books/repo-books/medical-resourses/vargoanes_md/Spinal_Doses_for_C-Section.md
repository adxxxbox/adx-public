Spinal Doses for C-Section    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Spinal Doses for C-Section

T4 level (nipple level) of anesthesia is needed for a C-section  
T10 level for a vaginal delivery  
  
_For a single shot spinal, most clinicians administer anywhere from 10.5-13 mg of 0.75% Bupivicaine in combination with morphine or fentanyl or both, with a combined total volume at or very close to 2 cc.  
  
_Remember - pregnant women require SMALLER doses of spinal local anesthetics than nonpregnant women.  
  
**Intrathecal Preservative Free (PF) Agents** Make sure all intrathecal medications administered are PF for allergic reasonsAstromorph and Duramorph are both preservative free morphine  
  
**Intrathecal Bupivicaine remains the predominant LA for the following reasons:**  
FDA has NOT approved Ropivacaine or Levobupivacaine for intrathecal administration.  
Intrathecal Bupivicaine provides a dense block with a long duration.  
Intrathecal Lidocaine has a much shorter duration than Bupivacaine  
  
**Common Total Intrathecal Volume  
**2 cc total volume (between narcotic and bupivacaine) is very common  
It is NOT uncommon to administer a total volume of 1.6-2.2 cc.

| Local Anesthetic | Dose Range | Duration (mins) | Duration with Epi |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bupivacaine | 7.5 - 15mg | 60-120 |  |
| Levobuvacaine | 7.5 - 15mg | 60-120 |  |
| Ropivacaine | 15 - 25mg | 60-120 | No difference |
| Lidocaine | 60 - 80mg | 45-75 |  |

Chestnut’s Obstetric Anesthesia 5 th Ed 2014; pp562  
  
Procaine and Tetracaine LA can also be used, but are rarely given.  
  
Intrathecal Bupivicaine doses as low as 4.5 mg have been successful in C-sections.  
Larger doses of 15 mg intrathecal Bupivicaine do NOT increase duration of surgical anesthesia.  
Some clinicians will: reduce the Bupivicaine dose for shorter patients  
increase the Bupivicaine dose for taller patients  
  
**Spinal Bupivicaine** in the U.S. is formulated as 0.75 % (7.5 mg/cc) solution in dextrose 8.25% (hyperbaric).

| Morphine | 0.1-0.2 mg | 720 - 1440 mins |
| Sufentanil | 2.5-5 mcg | 180 - 240 mins |
| Demerol | 10-15 mg |  |

**Note:** Intrathecal Sufenta > 5 mcg has been associated with pruritus and somnolence

| Narcotic | Dose | Volume |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Morphine (Astromorph) | 0.1 mg | at 1mg/cc = 0.1 cc |
| Fentanyl | 10-15 mcg | at 50mcg/cc = 0.2-0.3 cc |

  
  
**Why intrathecal opioids are administered as an adjunct to LA**  
They augment the quality and increase the duration of a LA induced spinal  
Intrathecal Fentanyl and Morphine combined provide a fast onset and prolonged duration(It is common for clinicians to add a lipid soluble (fast onset) narcotic (Fentanyl) to a water-soluble (prolonged duration) narcotic (Morphine) as an adjunct to the LA  
  
**Common intrathecal narcotic doses and volume**  
0.1mg (1mg/cc) of Morphine (Astromorph) (0.1 cc volume) – is very common  
10-20 mcg of Fentanyl (0.2-0.4 cc volume) is the common Fentanyl dose  
  
**Intrathecal Clonidine as an adjunct to LA for C-sections** table.tableizer-table { font-size: 12px; border: 1px solid #CCC; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; } .tableizer-table td { padding: 4px; margin: 3px; border: 1px solid #CCC; } .tableizer-table th { background-color: #104E8B; color: #FFF; font-weight: bold; }

| Analgesic | Dose Range |
| --- | --- |
| Clonidine | 60-150 mcg |

Chestnut’s Obstetric Anesthesia 5 th Ed 2014; pp563**  
  
Intrathecal Clonidine does the following:**  
Improves intraoperative analgesia  
Prolongs both sensory and motor blockade  
Decreases shivering  
Reduced peri-incisional hyperalgesia with c-sections  
Associated with HYPOtension and sedation  
Currently, neuraxial clonidine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for intractable neuropathic pain.  
Most commonly given when neuraxial opioid analgesia is contraindicated  
  
_Clonidine has a “black box warning” warning by the FDA with obstetric patients due to hemodynamic instability concerns._  
  
**Intrathecal Neostigmine** (too much nausea)Spinal neostigmine up to 100 mcg has significantly reduced postoperative pain with no effect on on FHR or APGAR scores. The antinociceptive effects are due to increased acetylcholine and generation of nitric oxide.  
Other side effects: bradycardia, anxiety, agitation, restlessness and lower extremity weakness.  
Unfortunately 100% of patients receiving 100 mcg of neostigmine has been said to become nauseated, limiting its use.  
**  
Spinal Epinephrine as an adjunct to LA for C-sections  
**Epinephrine is used as a tissue vasoconstrictor that limits the vascular reabsorption of the local anesthetic in contact with the nerve fibers. This prolongs the duration of the local anestheticEpinephrine comes in vials of 1mg in 1 mL, which is a 1:1000 solution.The dose range is 0.1 mg-0.2 mg which = 0.1cc-0.2cc

| Drug | Dose Range |
| --- | --- |
| Epinephrine | 0.1-0.2 mg |

Chestnut’s Obstetric Anesthesia 5 th Ed 2014  
  
**What is an Epi wash (swish)?** Many just do what we call a “swish” or "epi wash" of Epinephrine.  
An ampule of epinephrine comes prepackaged in the spinal kits. You use the syringe you will place your local anesthetic in, but first draw up 0.1mL of Epi and then squirt it out. This leaves some residue of epi in the syringe and hub, which will increase the duration of your block.  
  
Analgesia is prolonged by 15-40 minutes when epinephrine is added to intrathecal bupivacaine –opioid.  
  
Epinephrine doses as low as 2.25 mcg prolong analgesia by 15 minutes.  
  
**Ropivacaine  
**Ropivacaine is less potent than spinal bupivacaine  
Ropivacaine has a much less risk of transient neurologic symptoms than spinal lidocaine.
