### Heart Transplant Patient for Noncardiac Surgery Anesthesia

**Consider reviewing the following topics first:**  
_"Heart Transplant Drugs That Work and Don't work"  
"Heart Transplant Patient for Noncardiac Surgery-Pre-Op"_  
  
**Hydration:** Hydrate these patients preoperatively.  
  
**Anesthetic Goals:  
**Avoid significant vasodilation  
Avoid acute decreases in preload  
Avoid bradycardia  
Avoid contamination and infection  
  
**Choice of anesthetic technique:  
****MAC with local or regional anesthesia is preferred, when possible.**  
General anesthesia is usually preferred over neuraxial.  
**Epidural anesthesia** has been used safely on obstetric patients for labor analgesia and cesarean section delivery.  
**Spinal anesthesia** has been used safely for TURPS.  
**  
Table Top Medications:**  
Isuprel-diluted syringe  
Epinephrine- diluted syringe or  
Norepinephrine  
Etomidate  
  
**Other meds that work:  
Dobutamine:** Can also increase HR, inotrope  
**Milrinone:** Does not work as well as epinephrine, inotrope  
**Dopamine:** Weak inotrope and acts predominantly as a dopaminergic and vasopressor.  
**Ephedrine:** Blunted response because it is an indirect-acting vasopressor that exerts its effects via the autonomic nervous system.  
**Propranolol:** Decreases HR and contractility  
**CaCl2:** 0.5-1 gram can be effective in increasing contractility in a denervated heart, but lacks adequate supporting literature.  
**Digoxin:** No change in heart rate, inotrope  
**Adenosine:** Will cause a significantly prolonged and profound bradycardic effect  
**Verapamil:** May cause severe bradycardia  
**BISS monitor:**  
The patient will have a delayed or no sympathetic reaction to an inadequate level of anesthesia.  
  
**Arterial line:** For procedures that have the potential for fluid shift and blood loss.  
  
**EKG:**  Two P waves may be present; this is normal.  
First-degree AV block is common after cardiac transplantation.  
Some patients may have pacemakers to maintain a normal or elevated heart rate.**  
  
Induction:**  
**Etomidate:** Optimal  
Caution with propofol as it decreases SVR (preload)  
  
**Intubation:** Oral is preferred over nasal intubation because the nasal flora can cause an infection.  
There is little or no sympathetic response to direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.  
**Inhalation Agent:** Avoid nitrous oxide; it can increase PVR.  
The most commonly used inhalation agents have well-documented myocardial depressant properties, yet they are generally tolerated unless there is significant heart failure.  
  
**Muscle relaxant:** Use minimally and only when necessary.  
**Cisatracurium (Nimbex®)** causes the least histamine release.  
**Vecuronium and rocuronium** are still commonly used.  
**Pancuronium** has no hemodynamic effects on the denervated heart, although it has typical systemic effects.  
  
**Positioning precautions and limitations may exist due to:  
**Difficulty with positioning (steroid-induced osteoporosis)  
Obesity secondary to glucocorticoid therapy.  
  
**Muscle relaxant reversal in heart transplant patients:  
**Consider sugammadex for reversal, with caution.  
Sugammadex's mechanism avoids the cholinergic effect (bradycardia).  
However, some studies have reported instances of bradycardia following sugammadex administration, suggesting a need for caution and close monitoring in these patients.  
  
**Avoid neostigmine:** Controversial- literature varies.  
Bradycardia and asystole (DEATH) after neostigmine have been reported in adult cardiac transplants during or after the six months following surgery.It is documented that neostigmine on a denervated heart results in a range of effects from no response to asystole.  
As mentioned earlier, atropine and glycopyrrolate (anti-muscarinic drugs) have been shown to have minimal to no effect on the heart rate of the denervated heart.  
For this reason, many anesthesia providers avoid administering neostigmine (an anticholinesterase agent) because it may result in refractory bradycardia.  
  
**Edrophonium:** Is documented to result in less bradycardia in a denervated heart.  
**Extubation:** Should take place as soon as feasible; this decreases the risk of pneumonia.  
Sterile technique must be used during endotracheal suctioning prior to emergence because these patients are on immunosuppressants.  
**Post-op care:**  
**Major postoperative concerns:**  
Hypotension from reduced preload  
Infections  
Adverse cardiac events (myocardial ischemia/infarction, ventricular dysfunction, cardiac death).  
  
**Maintenance of adequate preloads:  
**Be aware that intra-abdominal procedures associated with significant fluid shifts are vital because the denervated heart cannot compensate for hypovolemia by increasing HR.  
In selected cases, invasive monitoring may be required for adequate volume replacement. Monitoring for myocardial ischemia or infarction should continue postoperatively because this is the period most vulnerable for cardiac events in patients with CAD.
