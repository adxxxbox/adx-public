### Breastfeeding - Drug Transmission Basic Notes

Just prior to birth, a parturient will usually only receive anesthesia drugs for a few hours. Studies show that only a minimal amount of anesthesia drugs will be ingested by the newborn with breastfeeding, and only a minimal amount of that will be absorbed systemically. Therefore, we permit mothers to breastfeed after anesthesia – as long as they are awake and conscious.  
  
In the past, women were advised to cease breastfeeding for 24 hours after surgery, and dump their breast milk during this time ("pump and dump"). This is not the case anymore.  
  
After a parturient awakes after general anesthesia, the brain concentration of your standard anesthesia drugs is lower in breast milk than in the brain of the mother.  
  
A relatively small amount of anesthesia drugs is excreted into the breast milk.  
  
If a breastfeeding mother is fully conscience with normal respirations, then her breastmilk’s anesthetic drug concentrations are too low to depress an infant’s respirations.  
  
When a suckling infant ingests breastmilk that contains an any anesthetic drug, you need to remember that only a fraction of the drug will be absorbed into the infant’s blood. Remember the “first pass effect?”  
  
**Only a few drugs are absolutely contraindicated during breast feeding:**  
Radioactive substances  
Ergotamine  
Lithium  
Psychotropic agents
