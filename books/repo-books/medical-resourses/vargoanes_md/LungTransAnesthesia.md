Lung Transplantation and Anesthesia    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Lung Transplantation and Anesthesia

The surgical removal of one or two diseased lungs followed by the placement of one or two donor lungs. Many times, this is combined with a heart transplant. The donor organs must be placed within 4-8 hours after retrieval to avoid ischemic reperfusion damage.  
  
**Survival rate**  
According to the 2013 Registry report, the median survival for all adult recipients is 5.6 years.  
Receiving a single lung transplant without a history of cystic fibrosis or idiopathic pulmonary hypertension results in a median survival for all adult recipients of 4.6 years  
Bilateral lung transplant (BLT) recipients appear to have a better median survival rate of 6.9 years.  
  
**Potential therapeutic benefits of BLT**  
Reduction in alveolar damage during reperfusion during transplantation  
Improved pulmonary compliance and mechanics,  
Avoidance of native lung pathology (from the other lung)  
  
**Primary graft dysfunction (PGD)**  
Leading cause of death in the first 30 days (~25% of deaths).   
A form of ARDS/diffuse alveolar damage, which occurs in the early hours to days after transplant.  
**  
Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS)  
**BOS is a manifestation of chronic allograft rejection or chronic graft dysfunction.  
After the first year of lung transplantation, BOS is the leading cause of mortality (~40% of deaths).  
  
**Common Indications for lung transplantation  
**COPD, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency,  
Bronchiectasis  
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  
Cystic fibrosis  
Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension  
Sarcoidosis  
Congenital heart disease   
  
**Pre-op day of surgery  
**Review anesthesia, medical and surgical history  
Recent deteriorations in functional status/increase in oxygen or inhaled nitric oxide (iNO ) requirement  
  
**Risk and concerns regarding preoperative epidural insertion  
**Bloody tap  
Epidural hematoma: increased risk accompanies subsequent full heparinization for cardiopulmonary bypass.  
Timely decompression may be delayed due to prolonged surgery and inability to elicit clinical signs in the sedated and intubated patient.  
Benefit of TEA may be lost if the patient has been sedated during prolonged intubation.  
  
**Labs and test results**  
CBC, BMP, LFTs, Cr/BUN  
ECG,  
Echocardiography  
Stress test  
Right and/or left heart catheterization  
CXR  
PFT  
Ventilation/perfusion scan  
  
**Postoperative pain and thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA)  
**TEA provides superior analgesia compared to intravenous opioids.  
Patients should be selected carefully based on risk and benefit discussions.  
Some anesthesia providers insert the epidural after the procedure prior to leaving the operating room.  
Discuss with the patient the insertion of an epidural prior to extubation to manage postoperative pain.  
  
**Current mediations, especially continuous pulmonary vasodilators  
Note:** Any disruption or alteration of a continuously infused pulmonary vasodilator may result in rapid deterioration and/or death.  
IV epoprostenol (Flolan®) may be infusing through a central catheter.  
Do not interrupt or alter the infusion rate.  
Do not piggyback anything with the occupied central line.  
Confirm infusion rate and determine when the refill is due.  
A backup pump and backup supply of epoprostenol must be readily accessible throughout surgery.  
  
**Preoperative Preparation**   
**Machine check**  
Ensure proper setup of **iNO, including modifications to** circuit with humidifier, and any added injection and sampling lines.   
  
**Airway Equipment** **Left sided double lumen tube (DLT).**      
Men > 6 ft tall: 39 Fr, ≤ 6 ft tall: 37 Fr  
Women: 35 or 37 Fr  
Fiberoptic equipment with DLT exchange catheter  
Video laryngoscope for backup  
  
**Monitors**   
Two pulse oximeters  
  
**Triple transducer:** Arterial, CVP, femoral artery; ±PA (4th transducer)   
Cerebral Oximeter x 2   
Trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE)   
  
**Intraoperative immunosuppression (check protocol).**  
**Example of UCSF protocol below:**  
Mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept) 1000 mg: give over 2 hours  
Basiliximab (Simulect) 20 mg: give slowly as IV infusion over 20 minutes   
Methylprednisolone (Solu-medrol): need 500 mg per each graft lung given prior to unclamping   
  
**Antibiotics (check protocol) Below is an example from USAF protocol**  
Vancomycin 1 g q12h over 30-60 minutes  
Ceftriaxone 1-2 g q12h prior to incision ± Piperacillin/Tazobactam 3.375 or 4.5 g slowly IVP prior to incision (for chronic infection such as pseudomonas, discuss with the surgeon during time out.)  
  
**Bolus drugs/syringes available**  
**Induction agents:** midazolam, fentanyl, ±propofol/etomidate, and NMBAs)  
Ketamine: Usually for patients with severe pulmonary hypertension.   
Calcium chloride (100 mg/ml)   
Vasoconstrictors/inotropes (vasopressin, epinephrine, phenylephrine, ephedrine)  
Nitroglycerine (20 mcg/ml), esmolol  
Full dose heparin (400 units/kg for CPB, may need less for ECMO)   
Esmolol  
Labetalol  
Hydralazine  
  
**Anti-fibrinolytics**  (usually, when patient is going on CPB or ECMO)   
Aminocaproic acid (10 g bolus over 30 minutes then 2 g/hr infusion), OR   
Tranexamic acid (30 mg/kg bolus over 30 minutes then 16mg/kg/hr)   
  
**Possible Infusions (check with surgeon)**  
Norepinephrine (mcg/kg/min)  
Epinephrine (mcg/kg/min)  
Vasopressin (units/min or units/hr) Does NOT increase PVR  
Milrinone (mcg/kg/min): For RV failure in the setting of pulmonary hypertension. It will    
also decrease SVR; another pressor is required.  
Nitroglycerine (mcg/kg/min)  
Insulin (units/hr)   
  
**Available blood products**  
PRBC (4 units)  
FFP (4 units)  
Platelet, cryoprecipitate (rarely needed)  
Additional albumin (2L)  
  
**Preinduction  
Many** anesthesia providers prefer to transport the patient directly to OR, especially for those patients on nitric oxide, IV epoprostenol (Flolan®), inotropes, and ECMO.   
**Baseline cerebral oximeter:** Level should be equal to at preop oxygen level.  
  
**IV:** Have at least one large bore PIV for induction.  
**Radial arterial line (** preferably on the RUE): In the setting of peripheral (femoral) ECMO, ABG from the right arm is more representative of lung/graft function due to less mixing with the oxygenated ECMO blood (farthest from the femoral arterial cannula).  
Wait for final confirmation of the donor organ from the surgeon.

**Anesthetic:** General with a double lumen endotracheal tube (DLT) involving one lung ventilation (OLV).  
Bronchial blockers are rarely used because they are prone to intra-operative movements and mispositioning.

Broncho-alveolar cancer  
Profuse watery secretions  
Modified from EACTA 2012 | Abstracts     PPV: positive pressure ventilation  
                                                                    CPB: Cardiopulmonary bypass  
**Hemodynamic induction goals  
**Preserve systemic vascular resistance (SVR).  
Preserve myocardial contractility.  
Avoid increasing pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR).  
  
**Induction positioning  
**May not tolerate supine position. It may be necessary to initially mask patient in the seated position while awake.  
  
**Caution with mask ventilation  
**The patient may require high pressure, low volume and rapid breathing if the patient has restrictive disease,  
OR  
It may be necessary to avoid excessive pressure and “auto-PEEP” if the patient has COPD and blebs.  
  
**Nitric oxide post intubation**  
Discuss the need for iNO prior to induction with the surgeon.  
**  
Induction:**  
_Systemic hypotension and bradycardia are poorly tolerated in pulmonary hypertension._  
Consider preemptive pressor or inotrope infusion to avoid hypotension and RV failure prior to induction.  
  
**RSI:** Administer etomidate for a low EF.  
**Goal:**  Smooth and expedient to avoid hypoxia/hypercapnia which may trigger RV failure and cardiovascular collapse.  
Ketamine is an alternative and ideal choice of induction agent in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension.  
  
**Intubation with appropriately sized DLT**  
Desaturation may occur quickly. This is poorly tolerated.  
  
**Fiberoptic confirmation**  of ETT position.  
Backup equipment/plan in case of difficult intubation with DLT.  
A single lumen ETT with a bronchial blocker may suffice for an on-pump single lung transplant.  
  
**Post-induction tasks  
**Additional PIV (if patient only has 1)  
Central line, usually in the RIJ  
PA pressure measurement (discuss with the surgeon)  
Femoral arterial line is usually inserted by the surgeon.  
  
**Start antibiotics and immunosuppressants (except methylprednisolone)**  
**Anesthesia Maintenance  
Midazolam:** ≤ 10 mg total unless with known tolerance   
**Fentanyl:** ≤ 10-20 mcg/kg unless with known opiate tolerance   
**Muscle relaxation:** Required; rocuronium, vecuronium, or cisatracurium.  
**Nitrous oxide:** avoid  
**Volatile inhaled anesthetic:** isoflurane or sevoflurane   
**IV Access:** 1-2 large bore IVs  
**Radial A-line:** Required, preferably on the right upper extremity.  
In the setting of peripheral (femoral) ECMO, ABG from the right arm is more representative of lung/graft function due to less mixing with the oxygenated ECMO blood (farthest from the femoral arterial cannula).  
**Central Line:** For patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure.  
Central venous access is recommended, and the pulmonary artery catheter is floated into position prior to induction because these patients are extremely hemodynamically compromised during induction of anesthesia.  
**TEE:** Yes  
**Hydration:** Limit fluids. Many patients need diuretics later.  
A newly transplanted lung does not have lymphatics to resorb excess fluid.  
**Single Lung:** Lateral or posterior lateral thoracotomy.  
**Bilateral Lungs:** Supine with arms **abducted at shoulders and forearms elevated.** Frequently check arm placement; arms may move with table tilting.  
Foam headrest.  
**Heart/Lungs:** Supine, median sternotomy. Sometimes a bilateral anterior thoracotomy is performed.  
**Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB):** Always for Heart/Lung transplant.  
**Single and Bilateral lungs:** Sometimes CPB is used; it’s also a back-up if the patient can’t be adequately ventilated. There is more bleeding with bypass.  
**FiO 2 :** Enough to keep the SaO 2 \> 96%.  
**  
Duration:**  
**Single Lung:** 2-4 hours  
**Bilateral:** 5-6 hours (they used to take 6-12 hours).  
**Heart/lung:** 4-5 hours  
**Ventilation:** Avoid barotrauma. PEEP of 5 cm H2O; goal is to limit peak airway pressures to 20-25 cm H2O. Goal is to maintain FiO2 below 0.5.  
**EBL:**  
**Single lung:** <500 ml, more if CPB is used.  
**Bilateral:** 500-2,000 ml.  
**Heart/lung:** 500-2,000 ml.  
**Emergence and extubation:** Not applicable; these cases always go to the ICU intubated.  
  
**During surgical dissection/exposure**    
**Communicate with surgeons concerning:**  
Blood pressure preference  
PA pressure  
Pressor/inotropes  
Oxygenation  
One vs. two lung ventilation  
**For bilateral transplant  
**An a **nterolateral thoracosternotomy incision**  (“clam-shell”) is performed.  
**  
Ventilation may be difficult:  
**Many of these patients have restrictive lung pathology, connective tissue disease, and drug or radiation induced parenchymal lung disease.  
Peak pressures exceeding (PIP) 40 cm H2O may be required.  
This is tolerated especially if bilateral sequential single-lung transplantation (BSSLT) is planned.  
Aggressive airway toileting is required during surgery as lung manipulation can squeeze purulent alveolar secretions into the large conducting airways.For other patients, the increase in PIP increases the risk of pneumothorax or broncho-pleural  fistula and further injury to the native lungs.  
  
**Warning:** High FIO2 increases the risk of surgical field fire.  
**Dissection and removal of the first native lung**  
This may be prolonged and difficult when extensive pleural adhesions are present due to restrictive or suppurative lung disease.  
Significant blood loss may occur.  
For BSSLT performed off pump, if there is a significant perfusion asymmetry, the lung with the lower perfusion is transplanted first.  
The surgeon will test the hemodynamic consequences of dividing the pulmonary artery by pinching it off temporarily. This is advised because the right ventricle may acutely fail.  
**  
OLV to other lung during lung dissection  
****Intermittent OLV**  is needed during the dissection.  
O2 saturation will drop drastically.  
Discuss with surgeon strategies to maintain saturation during OLV (100% FiO2, PEEP, CPAP etc.)  
You may request the surgeon to revert to two lung ventilation.Discuss the need for iNO if desaturation worsens.  
**Suction**  may be necessary if there is chronic infection or thick secretion  
  
**Dissection of **bronchus, pulmonary artery and veins****  
Severe hypotension may result from high intra-thoracic pressure,  
manipulation of the lung and compression of the heart or great vessels, especially if there is inadequate preload.   
  
**Anastomosis of new donor lung**  
A cooling jacket with ice cold saline being circulated through it is placed in the thoracic cavity to minimize warm ischemic injury to the graft during this stage. This jacket may contribute to patient hypothermia.  
The bronchial anastomosis is completed first immediately followed by bronchoscopic pulmonary toileting of the graft.  
The pulmonary artery anastomosis is first  
Pulmonary vein anastomosis follows  
Venous anastomosis is done by grafting an island of donor atrium containing the upper and lower pulmonary veins on to the recipient’s left atrium.  
An atrial clamp is required. Clamping may cause arrhythmias, impede left ventricular filling, or obstruct a coronary artery.  
  
**Surgical access to the hilum and atrium for anastomosis my cause hypotension  
**During this time, communicating with the surgeon is very important.Getting access the hilum and atrium requires retraction of the heart, which causes intermittent periods of hypotension and low cardiac output  
The patient may require vasopressor and fluid expansion to optimize preload.  
**Warning:** excess hydration may cause pulmonary edema.  
  
**Graft implantation**   **without CPB**  
The surgeon will request heparin 3000-5,000 units prior to cross-clamping the pulmonary artery.  
Have epinephrine or dobutamine available for inotropic support as needed.  
**Surgeon then inserts new lungs** in chest cavity.  
**Bronchial anastomosis:** **Surgeon will request** a valsalva maneuver at 30 cmH2O on the graft lung submerged under water at the completion of anastomosis to detect a leak. **Pulmonary vein anastomosis is first  
Pulmonary artery anastomosis:** **Surgeon will request the administration of methylprednisolone 500 mg prior to the unclamping the pulmonary artery and reperfusion of the graft organ.**  
  
**In preparation for reperfusion of the graft organ:**  
_Ensure bronchoscope is disinfected prior to inserting into the new graft organ._  
Bronchoscopy is used to inspect the bronchial anastomosis is intact (distally) through the ETT.  
Assess and suction out any intra-luminal blood  
**Note:** These patients are prone to hypovolemia due to due to prolonged NPO duration.   
**Hydration** : 2 liters or more of albumin or crystalloids prior to the end dissection.  
  
**Note:** Use new sterile suction catheters with new graft lungs.  
  
**Pericardium is opened**  
Surgeon will apply purse-string sutures for possible cannulation and CPB.  
Final decision for the need of CPB is made.  
The need for CPB should have been previously discussed  
  
**Deciding factors for CPB during dissection with OLV  
**Patient’s right ventricular function  
Presence of severe pulmonary hypertension  
Hemodynamic stability  
Oxygen saturation  
Presence of intra-cardiac anomaly requiring repair  
  
**Note:** Clamping results in elevated PA and RV function deterioration.  
**Advantages of CPB:  
**Hemodynamic stability, especially if there is significant RV dysfunction.  
Saturation is easily maintained.  
The first graft organ may be rested while on CPB.  
Does not require aggressive ventilation or oxygenation.  
Permits the surgeon the opportunity to repair any intra-cardiac shunt or tricuspid regurgitation on CPB.  
  
**Advantages of off pump:**  
Avoids blood exposure to the CPB circuit  
Does not need coagulopathy, thus less bleeding  
Avoids instrumentation of aorta and vascular complication  
  
**If procedure was done off -pump**  
Draw frequent ABGs to assess for increased respiratory acidosis due to diseased lungs during OLV.  
Metabolic acidosis may be present resulting from low cardiac output, anemia, or the use of vasoconstrictors.  
Consider treating with sodium bicarbonate (if ventilation permits) or THAM (if renal function adequate) to correct the acidosis prior to reperfusion.  
Have calcium and vasopressor/inotropes on standby.  
  
**Start iNO:** (if not already in use) at 20 ppm, and increase the fresh gas flow to match minute ventilation to deliver correct iNO dose and avoid rebreathing/NO2 accumulation.  
  
**Start ventilation** : FiO2 ≤ 0.6, PEEP ≤ 7 cmH2O, and tidal volume ≤ 6 mL/kg (two lungs). Make sure that adequate pressure is used to “recruit” the graft lung and eliminate atelectasis.  
  
**Reperfusion of graft (a critical and busy period)**  
May require an extra set of hands to deal with differential lung ventilation and cardiovascular emergencies at the same time.  
Before the anastomosis is completed, the new graft is de-aired through an opening in the atrial anastomosis.  
This is done by inflating the lung to a sustained pressure of 15-20 cm H2O and partially releasing the pulmonary artery clamp.  
The atrial clamp is then released to de-air the atrial cuff before the final knot is tied.  
  
**At this time, hypotension may occur due to:  
**Blood loss, which may occur with leaks in the initial vascular anastomoses until they are sealed. This may require prompt volume replacement while sealing the anastomosis.  
Myocardial stunning occurs as the initial venous return to the left atrium is cold, contains ischemic metabolites, and is acellular. This can be treated with epinephrine or calcium.  
Coronary artery air embolism may also occur.  
A transient ST depression or elevation may occur in the inferior leads. This should be treated with vasopressors.  
  
**The pulmonary artery clamp is slowly released  
**Reperfusion of the lung can release metabolites into the circulation causing acidosis and hypotension.  
Primary graft dysfunction ( **PGD)** can occur quickly with onset of pulmonary edema, which can be severe and may require urgent (re)initiation of CPB.  
To reduce risk of PGD, the pulmonary artery clamp is SLOWLY released over ten minutes to reduce the initial blood flow to the graft’s new vascular bed.  
  
**Gentle ventilator settings are initially applied to the new lung to reduce the risk of injury**  
Discuss the OLV setting for the graft organ with the surgeon.  
OLV settings are usually:  
FiO2 < 0.6  
PEEP 5-7  
Tidal volume 3-4 mL/kg (single lung).  
Initial respiratory rate of 8 -10 breaths per minute.  
Limit PIP to 15-20 cm H2O with pressure limit ventilation.  
  
**The other lung requires 100% oxygen, most easily given via a self-inflating bag.**  
**When pulmonary artery clamp is fully released**  
When the pulmonary artery clamp is fully released, ventilator settings must be adjusted to ensure adequate minute ventilation and oxygenation.  
Administer pressors, inotropes, calcium as needed.  
Avoid excessive fluid/albumin after donor lung implantation due to concern for over‑hydration and edema.   
The donor lung has NO functional lymphatics to resorb excess fluids  
Furosemide (bolus ± infusion) may be used to treat pulmonary edema.  
Dose according to patient’s preoperative diuretic exposure, to avoid excessive hypovolemia.  
  
**ABG 5 minutes after reperfusion** to assess graft function.  
**  
Repeat  on the other side for dissection and transplantation of the other lung**  
**For an off-pump BSSLT**  
The new graft must be supported with OLV while the other lung is being dissected.    
**  
Primary graft dysfunction (PGD)**  
PGD is acute lung injury (ALI) due to the transplantation process.  
Occurs in up to 25% of lung transplantations and increases both short- and long-term mortality.  
It may occur immediately following reperfusion and immediate intraoperative management is needed.  
It may range in severity from a mild self-limiting disease to fulminant respiratory failure.  
Manifested by poor oxygenation. Severity grading is based on PaO2/FiO2 ratios similar to acute lung injury.  
  
**Other intraoperative features  
**Poor respiratory compliance  
High PVR  
Pulmonary edema  
Initial management consists of protective ventilation by limiting volutrauma and barotrauma.  
Initiation of selective pulmonary vasodilators and right ventricular support may be required.  
In severe cases, ECMO may be required.  
Severe PGD is associated with hemodynamic and multiorgan failure and is the leading cause of early postoperative mortality.  
  
**Nitric oxide:** The common range of 10 to 40 ppm is used in established PGD to treat severe hypoxia or elevated pulmonary artery pressures.  
  
**Epoprostenol (Flolan®):**  Inhaled aerosolized prostacyclin (PGI2) is an alternative to inhaled nitric oxide. It is less expensive and does not require a bulky delivery system.  
Some literature states that _**epoprostenol**_  can be used for primary graft dysfunction.   Advantages include lowering pulmonary artery pressures, improving oxygenation and the lack of systemic side effects compared to inhaled nitric oxide.  
Intravenous prostaglandins are rarely used in the acute setting because their use causes hypotension.    
  
**ECMO post op is rare  
**PGD or RV dysfunction is rarely severe enough to require ECMO continued into the post-operative period.  
  
**If the patient needs to be placed on ECMO**  
Patient can be weaned from CPB first, heparin reversed, and hemostasis achieved before the initiation of ECMO, which requires heparin.  
  
**Central Cannulation:** Use the present CPB aortic and RA cannula to connect to an ECMO.  
**Peripheral cannulation** : Separate and insert V-cannulas in the femoral vessels.  
  
**Chest closure.**    
The surgeons will inspect both lungs and sometime perform a wedge resection if the lungs are oversized.  
Intermittent OLV is needed until closure.  
  
**Frequent ABG to assess graft function  
**More ABGs will be needed if there are changes in the outputs of one of the pulse oximeters or cerebral oximeters or the onset of hemodynamic instability.  
  
**Exchange DLT to a single lumen ETT**  
**Utilize a** direct or video laryngoscopy over a DLT exchange catheter.  
Once the single lumen ETT is in place and secured, some surgeons perform a   bronchoscopy and suctioning to assess the degree of pulmonary edema/secretion first hand, so they can compare it to the previous bronchoscopic findings.  
An improvement of SaO2 will often result with a bronchoscopy and suctioning.  
**  
Transfusion Goals  
**Always discuss Hct goal and the need to transfuse with the surgeon.    
Special consideration is paid to the cytomegalovirus (CMV) status of the patient and the donor.   
Some institutions will only transfuse leukoreduced PRBC units, which are generally considered to be CMV-negative equivalent. However, for lung transplant patients,  **if both the recipient and donor are CMV-negative, specific CMV-negative blood should be transfused.**  
  
**Resolve any present hematologic abnormalities  
**Patients who have preoperative coagulopathy or warfarin use may require factor replacement.  
Checking platelet counts and fibrinogen levels prior to end of CPB if there is suspicion of post-CPB coagulopathy.  
  
**Emergence and Extubation:** Not applicable; these cases always go to the ICU intubated.**  
ICU transport**  
  
**Ensure the continuous delivery of iNO during transportation.**  
Administer low-dose propofol for sedation during transportation   
  
**Transport the patient to the ICU.**  
Check ABG (on stable ventilation setting) prior to leaving the OR.   
  
**Standard post-operative course is for early epidural catheter placement**  by the pain team after the correction of any coagulopathy, initiation of epidural analgesia, followed by an extubation trial.  
Evidence of possible PGD, RV dysfunction, or the continuing need for ECMO may delay extubation  
iNO may be continued after extubation.  
Incentive spirometry, chest physical therapy, postural drainage, and early mobilization are important in the postoperative period.  
  
**Possible Complications:  
**Surgical hemorrhage  
Rejection is the most common complication  
Infection  
Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS)  
Post-transplant diabetes  
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)  
  
**Contraindications:  
**Some patients are in too poor condition to be submitted to the procedure:  
Patients who continue to smoke or abuse alcohol or other drugs.  
Patients who have active hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV.  
Patients who have had cancer within the past 2 years.  
Patients who have lung disease that will likely affect the new lung.  
Patients who have severe diseases of other organs.**  
  
Other Notes:**  
A PPO or Predicted Post-Operative FEV 1 <40% of normal is associated with increased risk of respiratory complications.  
The PPO FEV 1 percentage is the most valid PFT value.  
The standard Double Lumen Tubes or DLTs for transplantation can be associated with difficulty making the bronchial anastomosis, for reasons ranging from copious thick secretions through the narrow lumens of a DLT, to the need to change the DLT to a single-lumen tube for postoperative ventilation. These problems lead to combinations of bronchial blockers and single-lumen endotracheal tubes.  
Right ventricular dysfunction is a common cause for hemodynamic decompensation leading to the necessity for CPB.  
TEE is very useful to assess venous anastomoses, but it is extremely difficult to assess left-sided pulmonary arterial anastomoses.  
  
**Nitric Oxide (NO)**  
NO is useful to decrease elevated PA pressures and aid the failing RV. Due to better lung preservation, we are now transplanting lungs that would not have been used 10 years ago.
