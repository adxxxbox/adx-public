Interscalene Nerve Block (ISNB) Technique Continuous Infusion    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Interscalene Nerve Block (ISNB) Technique Continuous Infusion

Proper placement of the catheter in the interscalene groove is much more challenging than the single shot.  
The catheter is inserted around 2-3 cm beyond the tip of the needle and secured to the skin.  
  
**Catheter placement is more challenging due to the following:**  
The shallow position of the brachial plexus  
Stabilizing the needle during catheter advancement.  
  
**Insertion of catheter:**  
\- Once the needle is positioned in the interscalene groove, the needle tip location can be confirmed with nerve stimulation or by injecting a small amount of dextrose 5% through the needle.  
\- This will help confirm that the needle tip is in the interscalene groove and also ease the advancement of the catheter into the interscalene space.  
\- The next part of the procedure is to maintain the needle position while inserting a catheter through the needle.  
\- Once the catheter is inserted, the catheter tip position is confirmed by visualizing a small amount of local anesthetic injection through the catheter.  
\- Following this confirmation, the intended dose of local anesthetic is administered through the catheter.  
\- Since the catheter placement for these blocks is relatively superficial, it is important to secure the catheter well to avoid accidental dislodgement.  
\- Catheters may be tunneled to decrease the risk of dislodgement.  
\- However, tunneling can also make it harder for the patient’s caregiver to remove.  
\- A drop of derma bond at the catheter insertion site can help reduce pericatheter leakage and help secure the catheter (optional).  
\- The catheter is secured using an adhesive skin preparation followed by a clear dressing to allow inspection of the catheter insertion site.  
  
**Catheter placement duration:**  
Typically, 2–3 days postoperatively until the ON-Q (pain pump) is empty.  
Make sure you secure the catheter away from the surgical site.  
The catheter may be secured by tape.  
Some anesthesia providers use dermabond than mastisol with Tegaderm and steri strips.  
  
**Before initiating infusion postoperatively:  
**Check for patency and rule out intravascular placement by administering a small volume (2–3 mL of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:300,000).  
  
**Common settings and choice of local anesthetic:  
**0.2% of ropivacaine at 5 mL/hour with a patient-controlled bolus of 5 mL hourly for 48 hours.  
  
**Possible complications/adverse effects**  
Catheter dislodgement, migration, or retention  
Nerve injury  
Infection  
Local anesthetic toxicity  
Severe plexopathy and neurologic deficits from intraneural injection  
Dyspnea  
Hoarseness  
Insufficient anesthetic effect  
Cough reflex during drinking  
Ptosis  
Pericatheter leakage   
  
**Catheter placement technique:**  
A 19 or 20-gauge Tuohy needle is placed rather than a block needle. Stimulating Tuohy needles are available.  
A single- or multi- orifice catheter is inserted through the needle and advanced far enough to allow the catheter perforations to bathe the nerves, typically with 4 to 6 cm of catheter left in place.   
  
**Catheter-over-needle kits:  
These kits** are available for perineural catheter placement, including stimulating needle kits.  
Needle placement is the same as for a Touhy needle, but the catheter slides over the end of the needle, similar to intravenous (IV) catheter placement.   
Many anesthesia providers inject several mLs of local anesthetic (LA) through the needle under ultrasound guidance to confirm correct placement of the needle tip.  
Visualize the insertion of the catheter, and then inject the rest of the bolus through the catheter in divided doses while visualizing the spread of the local anesthetic.  
  
**Catheter placement with only a nerve stimulator:**  
Only, a **test dose** (1.5% lidocaine with epinephrine (5 mcg/mL\]) should be injected through the catheter to confirm that the catheter tip is not intravascular, epidural or intrathecal before injecting the block drug solution.
