### Anterior Repair: Cystocele Repair, or Anterior Colporrhaphy

This procedure can be combined with a Posterior Repair. It is an anterior vaginal procedure, done to repair a cystocele, which is a prolapsing or dropped bladder, utilizing the patient’s own tissue or fascia for the repair.

**Indication:** Prolapse of the bladder through the vagina. It is basically repairing a hernia of the vaginal wall between the bladder and the vagina. The bladder sits above the anterior section of the vagina.

It is performed vaginally by making an opening in the layer between the vagina and the bladder. The tissues are then reinforced with strong sutures in order to reinforce the weakened tissues.

Spinal: Rare  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours
