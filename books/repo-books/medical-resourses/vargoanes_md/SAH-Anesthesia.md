#### Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Anesthesia  
(Anesthesia plan is similar to Cerebral Aneurysm)

**Pre-op**  
Find out what grade bleed the SAH is.  
The clinical grade of the SAH correlates well with the ICP.

  
**Grade I or II**: SAH may be assumed to have normal ICP, intact cerebral autoregulation and a normal response to hyperventilation.  
**Grade III or IV:** SAH will have raised ICP, impaired autoregulation and reduced CO2 reactivity.  
Grade III and IV bleeds are usually already intubated and you keep them intubated post-op.

  
**Type and Cross:** Yes, and check for available blood.  
Check all your labs etc.  
The patient may be on a Calcium Channel blocker (Nimodipine or Nicardipine or both) prophylactically for post-SAH cerebral vasospasm. Literature everywhere states that severe hypotension may occur after induction. It is very rare.  
**Labs:** Blood sugar should be WNL, because hyperglycemia has been shown to worsen neurological deficits in the presence of cerebral ischemia.  
Patient maybe on “Triple H” therapy. Always ask the surgeon where he wants the BP to be.  
  
**Possible Drips:  
Nipride** or **Nitroglycerine  
Neosynephrine**  
**Remifentanil or Sufenta and Propofol** (with 0.5-1 MAC of Isoflurane)  
Warning: >0.5 MAC of Isoflurane increases CBF and ICP.  
**Precedex:** Enhances a smooth induction and emergence.  
  
**Anesthetic Goals:  
Maintain optimum CPP**: Neosynephrine (titrate to effect) is popular.   
**Decrease intracranial volume** (blood and CSF): Mannitol, Lasix, hyperventilation and normovolemia. Steroids decrease brain inflammation. These drugs and techniques all create more working space for surgeons and minimize the amount of brain retraction needed.   
  
**Decrease metabolic rate and CRMO2:** Accomplished by temperature, gases and drugs. This enables the brain to tolerate hypotension and ischemia if sudden decreases in MAP and CPP become necessary. Avoid hyperthermia.  
 **Anesthetic:** General/ETT. Tape the ETT on opposite side of the aneurysm.  
**A TIVA** technique may be preferred if ICP is markedly elevated. Inhalational agents at <0.5 MAC are suitable in most patients. We start to see increased CBF and vasodilation with >0.5 MAC of any gas. Combining TIVA and Isoflurane are becoming popular.   
**Induction Position:** HOB up 15-30 degrees to facilitate venous drainage and drainage of CSF.  
**Induction:** Goal is to induce gently to avoid increasing BP. Increasing the BP may increase bleeding.   
**Blood Pressure:** Always ask the surgeon. Literature tells us to keep BP within 20mmHg below the  
baseline SBP.   
**Thiopental:** Good luck if you could find some; most pharmacies don’t stock it any more.  
**Propofol or Etomidate:** Yes.  
**Esmolol:** 100-150mg 2 minutes before laryngoscopy to prevent transient tachycardia and HTN.   
**Fentanyl:** 5-10mcg/kg a few minutes prior to laryngoscopy.  
**Vasodilator:** Either Nitroglycerine or Nipride. Also have a Nitro diluted syringe handy. 1-2 mLs of Nitroglycerine mixed with NS or LR in a 10cc syringe**.  
Nitroglycerine: Connected and ready to titrate to effect.  
_See Nitroglycerine vs. Nipride note that follows this section._**  
**Nipride Drip:** 50mg in 250 D5W: titrate to effect just like NTG (not with a pump).  
We don’t like to mix Nipride with NS because it reacts with the plastic bag.  
**LTA Kit**: You should, but many still don’t use one.  
**Hyperventilation**: To lower ICP after intubation.  
**Remifentanil:** Can also be used to smooth the induction (see below).  
**Remi Induction dose:** 1-3mcg/kg over 1 minute.  
**Remi-Induction drip:** 0.5- 1mcg/kg/min and intubate in 5-8 minutes.  
**Muscle Relaxants**: YES: NO MOVEMENT! Anectine increases ICP, so avoid it if possible.  
If there is a difficult airway, you may need it because hypoxia and hypercarbia is worse for the ICP. Follow with a Non-depolarizing Muscle Relaxer when twitches have returned.  
**Muscle Relaxants:** Usually Rocuronium or Vecuronium. Check the Creatinine level.  
**Warning:** The duration of action of NDMR is reduced by many anticonvulsants. Note: Anticonvulsants are hepatic enzyme inducers.  
Atracurium and Cisatracurium is not affected by anticonvulsants due to Hoffman elimination. However, we still mostly use Rocuronium or Vecuronium.  
**IV Access:** 2 large bore IVs (14-18G)  
**IV Fluid:** All texts books say NS, but most of us still use LR. Each liter of LR has about 100 mls of free fluid.  
**Hydration:** Normolvolemic; volume restriction is no longer used to treat elevated ICP.   
Avoid Dextrose containing IVs, as dextrose exacerbates ischemia by increasing neuronal lactate production and edema.  
**Temperature:** Normothermic. Hyperthermia increases brain damage.  
Hypothermia (a decrease of body temp by 2°–3°C) can cause major neuro-protection. Sometimes used with bypass.  
**Inhalation Agent:** Usually Isoflurane (See Notes Below).  
**Nitrous Oxide:** NO, when combined with a volatile anesthetic, it can further increase CBF. When given alone, nitrous oxide causes mild cerebral vasodilation and can potentially increase ICP.  
**Central Line and CVP**: Not common anymore unless they expect a large EBL or it will be a very long case. However, some already have a central line for “Triple H” therapy from the ICU.  
**A-line:** Yes, if one is not already in from the ICU, we usually insert one just prior to induction on the operating room table while the patient is more sedated.   
**Neuro Monitoring:** Can be Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), motor evoked potentials (MEP), and electromyography(EMG).  
  
**Positioning:** Find out ahead of time if possible.  
Anterior Aneurysm: Supine with head 30-45 degrees turned away.  
Posterior Aneurysm: Lateral or supine.  
**Head stability:** Mayfield Head Pins.  
**Mayfield Pins and Propofol:** The application of Mayfield Pins is very stimulating. Most of us bolus the patient with 50-100mg of Propofol just prior to the application of the pins. This should prevent the BP from skyrocketing. So have some extra Propofol available. If you are using a Remifentanil drip, you can bolus it rather than Propofol. Esmolol is also popular because it is short acting.  
Sometimes the surgeon may inject a local to decrease the stimulation.  
  
Make sure the patient’s head is not flexed or rotated too far because it could decrease jugular venous drainage and can increase ICP. Make sure your vent tubing is stretched out and align correctly before they rotate the bed 90-180 degrees. Many of us tape the ventilator tubing out of the way over the patient’s chest. Arms are usually to the side but not tightly tucked.  
**uration:**

 2-4 hours  
**EBL:** 250-1,000 mLs.  
   
**Intra Op Maintenance:**  
You need to ask the surgeon where he wants the BP. Communication is key. Titrate your inhalation agents, drips and narcotics with the desired BP. Don’t use crystalloids to correct hypotension.  
**Ventilation:** Only mildly hyperventilate. Keeping the ETCO2 30-35mmHg. For every 1 mm Hg decrease in PCO2, CBF decreases by 1-2 mL/100g/min and is usually adequate to offset the vasodilatory effects of volatile anesthetics. If you OVER ventilate, the hypocarbia can over decrease cerebral perfusion. Avoid Peep >10cm H20\. It could decrease venous drainage and increase ICP.  
**ABGs:** Get a baseline before incision. Consider switching to LR if there is metabolic acidosis.  
The books state that there is potential for hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with using NS. This is textbook and is very RARE! Check your PaCO2 for adjusting ventilation.  
**Blood Loss:** Should be replaced at a 3:1 ratio (3L crystalloid per 1L EBL) to a hematocrit of 25-30%.  
**When the Dura is opened:** There is less stimulation and the Remifentanil or other agents may be decreased carefully.  
**Fluid Maintenance:** Normovolemic. If hyponatremia is present, cerebral edema may develop.  
**Labs:** Blood sugar should be WNL because hyperglycemia has been shown to worsen neurological deficits in the presence of cerebral ischemia.  
  
Patient maybe on “Triple H” therapy. Always ask the surgeon where he wants the BP.  
 

**Brain Protection Meds**  
If you don’t know your surgeon’s regiment, you should ask him/her about the three drugs below. They will tell you how much and when to give the drugs.   
**Mannitol:** 0.25-1mg/kg (25-50g) prior to opening the Dura.

   **Lasix:** usually 10-20mg prior to opening the Dura.  
   **Steroids:** Usually Decadron: 10mg Q4h is not unusual.  
   **Dilantin:** 1gram, although it is rarely given anymore. Don’t bolus it, can decrease BP.

  
**After Dura Incision:**  Anesthetic requirements drop substantially because the brain has no pain receptors. At this point, Propofol 50-150mcg/kg/min with Remifentanil 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg/min would be adequate while avoiding a slow wake up.  
After the head dressing is applied, the table will be turned back to its original position towards you.  
**Reversal:** It is recommended not to reverse your muscle relaxant until the dressing is on.  
**Emergence Warning:** There is an association between emergence hypertension and post-operative hemorrhage. So avoid bucking and hypertension.

**Emergence Recommendations:**  
Sit the patient up at 20° and place the arterial transducer at the level of the head.  
Check with the surgeon concerning deep or awake extubation. We usually perform a deep extubation unless there was a difficult airway. Some surgeons prefer a neurologic exam before leaving the operating room, but that is rare anymore.  
 

**Popular Crani Emergence Drugs**   
**Lidocaine:** 1.5mg/kg 1-2 minutes prior to suctioning and extubation. However lidocaine does slow the emergence.  
**Labetalol:** 40-60mg with emergence if the BP permits.  

**Prededex Drip:** Can also be used for this purpose. 0.2-1 mcg/kg/hr is the dose range. Using a 200mcg/2mL vial (100mcg/mL), inject 2 vials into a 100mLs bag of  NS, which gives you 4 mcg/mL.  For a 80kg patient, 0.5mcg/kg/hr is infused at 10mLs/hr.  
  
**Antiemetics:** PONV is very common with Craniotomies. Studies show a prophylactic antiemetic given shortly before emergence reduces PONV. 4mg of Zofran is the standard.

**Emergence Recommendations:**  
Check with the surgeon concerning deep or awake extubation. We usually perform a deep extubation unless there was a difficult airway.  
  
1.5mg/kg of Lidocaine 1-2 minutes prior to suctioning and extubation.  
Consider prophylactic labetalol 40-60mg with emergence if the BP permits. Emergence hypertension contributes to hematoma formation. Some surgeons prefer a neurologic exam before leaving the operating room, but that is rare anymore.  
  
**If the patient does not wake up, it could be from:**  
Lidocaine, Precedex or residual gases  
Elevated ICP   
Residual anesthesia or paralysis  
CO2 narcosis, hypoxia, and hypercarbia.  
Consider giving physostigmine (0.01-0.03 mg/kg) and/or Narcan (0.04 - 0.4 mg) to facilitate awakening.  
 

**More NotesNitroglycerine (NTG) vs Nipride**  
When the dura is still closed, Nipride is safer than NTG for lowering BP along with the ICP.   
NTG dilates veins. Veins are 3 times more distensible than arteries. Therefore, when you decrease the BP with NTG, you also increase the ICP as compared to Nipride. However, most of us seem to use NTG because it’s still acceptable and easier to use. After surgery, the surgeon will usually write orders to use either Nipride or Cardene for BP management.

**Isoflurane** **protects brain through two mechanisms:**  
It reduces excitatory neurotransmitters release by a presynaptic mechanism, an effect comparable to hypothermia (K Nakashima et al 1996).  
Forane decreases neuronal metabolism by a nontoxic mechanism.  
It lowers glucose takeover in neurons.  
Finally, it can induce an EEG isoelectric line at non-toxic concentrations (2MAC).
