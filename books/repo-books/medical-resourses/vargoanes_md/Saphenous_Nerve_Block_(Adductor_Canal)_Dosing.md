Saphenous Nerve Block (Adductor Canal) Dosing    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Saphenous Nerve Block (Adductor Canal) Dosing

1-2 ml of 1% lidocaine for skin infiltration in awake patients.  
**Low volume block:** 5-10mls of long-acting local anesthetic (LA)  
**High volume block:** 20-30mls of long-acting LA  
**Note:** _High volume (>15 ml) is not required, doing so may result in affecting motor branches of the femoral nerve causing quadricep weakness._  
  
**Common local anesthetic for this block:**  
10 to 15 mL of 0.2% ropivacaine or  
10 to 15 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine  
**Note:** In studies of saphenous blocks, 0.5% bupivacaine or 0.75% ropivacaine has been used.  
  
**Duration:** Between 6 to 18 hours**Quadriceps weakness:** Unpredictable and has occurred after blocks using much lower volumes of LA.  
  
**When the saphenous nerve cannot be identified:  
**Visualize in the distal thigh, the LA may be injected into the fascial plane between the vastus medialis and sartorius muscles.  
Injection of an additional 5-10 mL deep into the sartorius muscle is also recommended.  
  
**Continuous saphenous infusion technique:** (Not common)They are used with ultrasound guidance as described for a single injection block.  
**Needle:** Touhy needle  
**Catheter:** 19 or 20 gauge  
**Catheter depth:** Insert the catheter through the Touhy needle 4 to 6 cm into the adductor canal.  
**Bolus:** 10 to 15 mL of LA just as a single injection saphenous nerve block.  
**Postoperative continuous infusion rate:** Start infusion at 5 to 10 mL per hour or programmed intermittent bolus, 8 mL every hour to 15 mL every three hours.  
**Local anesthetic for continuous infusion:** 0.1 to 0.2% bupivacaine or ropivacaine.
