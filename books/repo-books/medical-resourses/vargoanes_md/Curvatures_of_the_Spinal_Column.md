### Curvatures of the Spinal Column

**The influence of spinal column curvatures on the distribution of Local Anesthetics  
  
**Normal anatomic curvature influences the spread of hyperbaric solutions.  
  
There is a natural lordosis in the lumbar area. Lordosis is especially pronounced in obese women, making them more susceptible to a high subarachnoid block.

There is also a natural thoracic kyphosis

When medications are injected above L3 and the patient is placed in a supine position the medication will spread cephalad until it reaches the T4 curvature which normally limits its spread.  
  
**Caution should be exercised in kyphosis, kyphoscoliosis, and lordosis  
**Abnormal changes in the anatomy of the spine may result in a decrease in the volume of CSF and subsequently increase the height of subarachnoid block.
