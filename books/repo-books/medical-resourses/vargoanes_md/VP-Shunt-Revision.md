### VP Shunt Revision

**Causes of Shunt Malfunction:**  
Particles or tissue may enter the shunt and block the flow of CSF.  
The shunt may become disconnected or broken, so that the CSF no longer drains into the right place.  
The child may have outgrown the shunt.  
Over-drainage: The shunt is draining more CSF than it should.  
Under-drainage: The shunt is not draining enough CSF.  
Shunt infection.

  
From an anesthesia standpoint, this case is similar, but usually it is shorter than the original VP shunt insertion. The surgeon can repair or completely replace the catheter. A guide wire is utilized to reinsert a new catheter if needed.

**Pre-op**  
Many of these patients may have symptoms related to elevated ICP- from a terrible headache to altered LOC.  
These patients are mostly kids. Check to see if they are on anti-convulsant meds because they alter drug metabolism. Be careful with sedation, since you know that hypoventilation increases CO2 which can increase the ICP and may lower seizure threshold. Look for possible co-morbidities: congenital cardiac disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, kyphoscoliosis, recurrent respiratory infections secondary to neurological dysfunction.  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT with the patient’s head slightly elevated.  
**Position:** Supine, arms to the side, head turned to the left, the contralateral side of the shunt insertion. Sometimes a shoulder roll will be used.  
Aggressive neck flexion may cause the ETT to migrate into the right mainstem. So watch your peak pressures and SaO2. Make sure your ventilator tubing, IV tubing and other cords are out of the way on the patient’s left.

**EKG leads:** place leads on the patient’s back; the right anterior surface is prepped.  
Bed is usually rotated 90 degrees.  
**Duration:** 30-90 minutes.  
**EBL:** minimal  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
**Ventilation:** Mild hyperventilation if an elevated ICP is involved.  
**Other suggested meds:** Ofirmev and anti-emetics.  
**Fluid warmer:** It is suggested, but most of us don’t use one. A large portion of the patient is exposed, making the patient prone to hypothermia.  
**Warming Blanket:** Lower body or underbody, depending on the patient’s age and size.  
**A-line:** No  
 

**Possible Complications**  
Head bleed  
Brain swelling  
Bowel perforation  
Leakage of CSF fluid under the skin  
Infection of the shunt or brain  
Damage to brain tissue  
Seizures  
The shunt may malfunction, thus requiring a surgical repair. 

**More Notes**

**Signs of a shunt malfunction (CSF build-up):**

  
**Newborn or Infant:**  
Poor feeding  
Vomiting   
Failure to thrive; lethargic.  
Bulging fontanels on the top of the head.  
Irritable   
Seizures  
Very noticeable scalp veins.  
‘Sunset’ eyes: the eyes appear to always look down and are not able to look up.  
A fluid leaking from the incision site.  
 

**VP Shunt malfunction signs for an older child:**  
Headaches  
Nausea and vomiting.   
Tiredness  
Irritable  
Changes in personality, behavior, or school performance.  
Seizures  
Changes in vision  
Loss of coordination  
Fluid leaking from the incision site.
