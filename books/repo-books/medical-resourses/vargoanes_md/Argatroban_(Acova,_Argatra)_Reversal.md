### Argatroban (Acova, Argatra) Reversal

_Currently, there is a lack of specific antidotes for the growing number of new (novel) anticoagulants that are slowly replacing warfarin and heparin. For this reason, there is NO universal standard of care for the treatment of the anticoagulated bleeding patient when there is no specific antidote._

**Consult cardiology for ALL patients with coronary stents.**

**Quick Notes** Direct thrombin inhibitor.  
**T1/2:** 40–50 minutes.  
**T1/2 with hepatic impairment:** ~ 181 minutes.  
**Antidote: None.  
  
****Monitor:** Serum creatinine, PT, aPTT, thrombin clotting time (TCT) and CBC (platelets).  
**aPTT:** Argatroban is normally titrated to keep the patient’s aPTT 1.5-2.5 times baseline.  
ACT measurements are commonly used with PCIs.  
  
**Non-Urgent**  
Discontinue drug and wait until aPTT is within normal limits.  
**  
Urgent (not bleeding): options vary among institutional protocols.**  
Discontinue drug  
If possible, delay procedure until aPTT or ACT returns to normal.**  
  
Mild Bleeding  
**Symptomatic treatment.  
Mechanical compression.  
Surgical intervention.  
Fluid replacement and hemodynamic support.**  
  
Moderate Bleed  
**Hematology consult.If hemostasis is not achieved with the strategies outlined above, consider the administration of  
2 - 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to competitively antagonize thrombin inhibition.  
  
**Life-threatening  
**Transfuse more platelets.  
Initiate massive transfusion protocols.  
FEIBA 8 to 25 units/kg or Kcentra can be considered.  
  
**Goal:** aPTT < 40 or DTI assay < 40
