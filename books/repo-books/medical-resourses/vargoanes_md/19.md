### Cross Clamping the Aorta (Once Full Flow) is Initiated

_Aortic cross clamp isolates the coronary arteries from aortic blood flow._  
  
Once full flow is initiated by the perfusionist, the heart is no longer ejecting blood into the pulmonary and systemic circulation.  
  
At full flow, all the venous return from the patient is directed toward the bypass machine, therefore the lungs no longer oxygenate the venous blood.  
  
Check patient’s face to rule out inadequate drainage from the superior vena cava.  
  
The surgeon will soon **cross clamp** the aorta.  
  
The ventilator may be turned off at this point. See the “Quick List” for further information.  
  
At this point, the surgeon is arresting the heart with cardioplegia.
