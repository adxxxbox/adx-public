### CABG Room Set up for Drugs and Drips

**Make sure you know what drips your surgeon likes and doesn’t like.**  
   
**Drugs and Drips**  
**Neo and Ephedrine syringes** (10cc)  
**Fentanyl** two 20mL vials  
**Versed**\-10-20mg  
**Propofol or Amidate**  
**Pavulon** or double strength **Norcuron or a lot of Zemuron.**  
**Ancef** 1-2 grams pre and when coming off pump  (2 grams if >80kg). It is easier to draw up 2 doses in 20cc syringe.  
**Vancomycin** 1gram if allergic to PCN (start in pre-op). Some prefer it with valves.  
**Antibiotics**\-give within 60 minutes of surgical incision and document. If renal function is OK, repeat Ancef Q3-4h if the chest is open.  
**Esmolol**\-have some ready in syringes or have accessible. For SVT, bolus 0.5-1mg/kg over 1 minute.   
**Solu-Medrol** 500mg-1g but only at the surgeon’s request.  
**Epinephrine** \- some CRNAs have a syringe ready; 5-10mcg/mL. Keep nearby.  
**Ca Chloride**\-have ready or accessible: 100mg/cc in 10cc syringe.  
**MgSo4** 2-4 grams in 5 or 10cc syringe, give right after aortic clamp. It is a good membrane stabilizer.  
**Heparin** draw 30-50K units in 60cc syringe.  With a strength of (1,000 U/cc) or (10mg/cc), a dose is 300U/kg (70 kg = 21cc) (80kg=24cc) (90kg=27cc). Make sure you have more Heparin in drawer in case of emergency.  
Always give Heparin and in 3 minutes draw ACT and get results back BEFORE CPB.  We usually draw the sample and Perfusionist runs it with their machine.  
**Amicar** – 10 grams in syringe.  Give slow push or over 30 min post induction.  
**Amicar Drip** - add 10 grams to 250mL bag and infuse at 2g/hr (50cc/hr) after 10g dose is done- Sometimes Pharmacies supply it.  
**Protamine**\- (10mg/mL) Draw up Protamine in 30 mL syringe.  
1 mg of protamine will inhibit 1 mg (approximately 100 units) of heparin. I find it is much easier to just think of heparin in units, NOT mg. Give 10mg of Protamine for every 1,000 units of **Heparin** given. Some surgeons will tell you how much Protamine they want you to give; others won’t. They might expect you to know the dose. So, a 70kg patient who received 21,000units (21mLs) of heparin will get reversed with 210mg or 21ccs of Protamine.  Many times the perfusionist will inform you what dose is needed. Put large red label or something flashy on the syringe and separate it from all your other meds. This is one drug you don’t want to accidentally give.

**Nitro and Neo Drip** Primed (Neo-10mg/250 of NS) or 40mcg/mL. Plug in both to central line. Most CRNAs don’t use a pump. Most just titrate manually. Label the tubing.  
**Dobutamine Drip** –primed and on pump, especially if EF <40%. Use when coming off pump.  
**Precedex** : Mix One 2mL vial (100mcg/mL) in a 50mL bag of NS. 200mcg in 50mL = 4mcg/mL. You can also mix 2 vials in 100mL bag: both = 4mcg/mL.  
Have primed and ready. Can connect to peripheral line.  
Dose Range (0.2-1.0 mcg/kg/hr): You can start at 0.4-.6 mcg/kg/hr pre or post induction.  
Ex 80kg patient x 0.4 mcg/kg/hr = 8 cc/hr.  Some of us infuse at 0.6mcg/kg/hr and start it when the patient is on bypass.  
**Precedex Tip**\-at 4mcg/mL, calculate by figuring 10% of patient’s weight in KG = 0.4mcg/kg/hr.  Ex: An 80 kg patient gets 8mL/hr = 0.4mcg/kg/hr.

**NaHCO3 Drip:** 3 amps in 1,000cc NS or DƽW prepared by pharmacy.  
Connect to one of the peripheral IVs; this stuff is not compatible with a lot of drugs.  
Bolus with 1 amp post induction, start drip at 1cc/kg/hr until cardiac recovery.  
**Insulin Drip**\-studies show that outcomes are better when blood glucose is regulated.  
Mix 100 units in 100mL of NS or D5W=1:1 ratio. Usually keep blood glucose around 150. Every hospital has its own Heart Sliding Scale.  
  
Have extra 3cc syringes for ACTs etc.
