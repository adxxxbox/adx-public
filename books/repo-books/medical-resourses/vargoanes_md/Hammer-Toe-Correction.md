### Hammer Toe Correction; or claw toe or contracted toe

Hammer Toe is a deformity of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the second, third, or fourth toe, causing it to be permanently bent, resembling a hammer.  

Hammer Toe occurs from a muscle and ligament imbalance around the toe joint, which causes the middle joint of the toe to bend and become stuck in this position.  
  
**Several different kinds of surgery can repair Hammer Toe:**  
The surgeon can remove parts of the toe bones.

The surgeon can cut or transplant the tendons of the toes.  

Fuse the joint together to make the toe straight and no longer able to bend. These surgical pins or  Kirschner wires or K-wires are used to hold the toe bones in place. 

**Anesthetic:** General/usually LMA; occasionally foot blocks are used.  
**Position:** Supine  
**Duration:** 45-90 minutes. Podiatrists are slower.

**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
**EBL:** Minimal-20mLs  
**Tourniquet:** Usually
