Fistulotomy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Fistulotomy

The surgeon cuts the channel (fistula) open, spreads it out flat, scrapes away pus and infected tissue, and sutures it to surrounding muscle tissue to prevent recurrence. 

**Anal Fistula**  
Usually an opening on the skin around the anus. Just inside the anus are a number of small glands: If one of these glands becomes blocked, an abscess-an infected cavity- may form. An anal abscess is usually treated by surgical drainage, although some abscesses drain spontaneously. About 50% of these abscesses may develop into a fistula, in which a small tunnel forms and connects the infected gland inside the anus and the external skin. This tract is buried within muscle tissue, and emerges through the skin near the anus.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT, sometimes LMA Spinal is optional  
**Positioning:** Jack-Knife or lithotomy  
**Duration:** 60 minutes

**EBL**: 10-50mLs  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  

Always ask the surgeon about limiting IV fluids.  
Difficulty urinating after any anorectal surgery may occur due to spasm of the urinary sphincter resulting from pain due to the surgery. A full bladder can also contribute to rectal pain via pressure. This would **NOT** be good with an overhydrated patient. Many surgeons want you to limit hydration. I have seen some protocols for the patients to have only a 500cc IV bag with micro drip tubing.
