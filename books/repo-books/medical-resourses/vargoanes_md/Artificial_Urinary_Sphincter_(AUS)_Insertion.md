### Artificial Urinary Sphincter (AUS) Insertion

An AUS is a device that closely simulates the function of a biological urinary sphincter.  
It is the gold standard treatment for severe stress incontinence that has failed conservative management.

**Procedure:**  
\- The patient is placed in lithotomy.  
\- A perineal incision is made.  
\- A pressure-regulated balloon is placed under the abdominal fascia.  
\- The pump is placed in the scrotum.  
\- The cuff is placed around the urethra.  
\- Post-placement cystourethroscopy is performed.  
  
 **Contraindications:**\- Urinary incontinence due to irreversibly obstructed lower urinary tract.\- Irreversible detrusor overactivity with urge incontinence, storage parameters creating a risk for upper tract deterioration.  
\- Bladder neck or vesicourethral anastomotic stricture.\- Active UTI.  
\- Recurrent disease (e.g., stone disease, bladder or ureteral tumors) that requires retrograde endoscopic instrumentation is a relative contraindication.  
  
**Anesthesia management:  
General:** usually LMA**Position:** Lithotomy**Duration:** 45-90 minutes  
**IV access:** 20g is acceptable  
**EBL:** Minimal  
  
**Possible complications:  
**Mechanical failure  
Urethra erosion  
AUS infection  
Suburethral atrophy  
  
_The long-term reoperation rate is about 20%._
