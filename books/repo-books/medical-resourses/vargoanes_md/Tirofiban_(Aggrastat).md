Tirofiban (Aggrastat)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Tirofiban (Aggrastat)

**Reversible GP IIb/IIIa Inhibitor and considered an “Anti-Platelet” medication.**  
  
**Reversible:** Meaning it is not bound to the platelets for the platelet’s entire life-span.  
  
**Class:** Direct GP(glycoprotein) IIb/IIIa Antagonist Platelet Aggregation Inhibitor.  
  
**Snake Venum:** A modified version of an anticoagulant found in the venom.  
Administered IV.  
  
**Indications:** to reduce the rate of thrombotic cardiovascular events  
(combined endpoint of death, myocardial infarction, or refractory ischemia/repeat cardiac procedure) in patients with non- ST elevation acute coronary syndrome.  
  
**Mechanism of Action**  
Reversible antagonist of fibrinogen binding to the GP IIb/IIIa receptor on the on the surface of platelets. Inhibits platelet aggregation.  
  
**What are the GPIIb/IIIa receptors**  
The major platelet surface receptor for the binding of fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor.  
Fibrinogen needs to bind to the GPIIb/IIIa receptors to aggregate with other platelets.  
  
**Note below:** on right, when the GPIIb/IIIa receptors are antagonized, they are unable to bind to fibrinogen and other platelets.

**Other GP IIb/IIIa Inhibitors  
**Eptifibatide (Integrillin®)-reversible  
Abciximab (Reopro®)-irreversible  
  
**Optional Laboratory Tests** (Platelet function should to be evaluated)  
VerifyNow IIb/IIIa test (platelet function assay)  
Multiplate (platelet function assay)  
PRP - Aggregation (platelet function test)  
PFA - 100/200 (platelet function assay)  
Whole blood aggregation (Platelet function assay)  
Plateletworks Assay (platelet function assay)  
**PT/PTT:** no measurable effect when administered alone.  
  
**Onset and Duration:** Rapid onset and short duration of action after proper IV administration. Coagulation parameters turn to normal 4 to 8 hours after the drug is withdrawn.  
  
**Specific Antidote:** None  
  
**Elimination Half- life:** 2 hours, prolonged in renal insufficiency.  
  
**Clearance:** Mostly renal with about 65% appearing in urine and about 25% in feces, both largely as unchanged tirofiban.  
  
Plasma clearance of tirofiban is decreased about 40% in subjects with creatinine clearance <60 mL/min and >50% in patients with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min, including patients requiring hemodialysis.  
  
**Metabolism:** limited; excretion: urine (65%), feces (25%).  
**Elimination T1/2:** 2 hours, prolonged in renal insufficiency.

| Minimal Time between  
last dose and neuraxial procedure | Can it be given with  
epidural catheter in place? | Restart after  
neuraxial procedure and/or  
catheter insertion | Restart after catheter removal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avoid until platelet function has returned  
to normal.  
  
GP IIb/IIIa antagonists are normally  
held 4 weeks prior to elective surgery. | NO | Avoid  
  
DO not restart if indwelling  
catheter is in place. | Avoid |

**Restart medication after procedure:** 4 weeks, monitor if prior  
**Remove catheter after administration:** Unknown.
