### CABG and Incorrect Positioning of Cannulas

Consistent methods of identifying cannulas is mandatory. The methods vary among institutions. The venous cannula it goes into the apex of the right atrium into the inferior vena cava. It is a drain line and may have bubbles.  
  
Facial edema (bulging sclera) reflects obstruction of venous drainage or inadvertent angling of the bevel of the aortic perfusion cannula toward the aortic arch.  
  
If the venous cannula is too far down (in the IVC), venous return from the lower regions of the body and can be decreased resulting in abdominal distention.
