#### TURBT (Transurethral Resection for Bladder Tumor)

**Indications:** To diagnose bladder cancer and to remove cancerous tissue from the bladder.      
A Resectoscope is passed through the urethra and used to remove the cancer for biopsy and to burn away any remaining cancer cells.  
  
**Indications:** TURBT is the current standard of care for the initial diagnosis, staging, and grading of all bladder tumors regardless of tumor depth of invasion and for the primary treatment of visible, NMI tumors.  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT or a spinal/epidural block.  
**Muscle relaxation:** Yes, because stimulation of the Obturator nerve during resectoscope passage into the urethra can and will cause a violent adductor contraction and possible inadvertent bladder perforation. This happens even under GETA, even when you may think you have the patient quite deep in an anesthetic.  
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes  
Consider a B&O Suppository to prevent post-op ureteral or bladder spasms.  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**Position:** Lithotomy, usually in the Cysto room.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
  
**Possible Complications**  
Bladder perforation-most serious  
Hemorrhage  
Reabsorption syndrome  
Urethral lesion or false passage  
   
**More Notes**  
The TURBT is the first-line surgical treatment for bladder tumors.

A bladder tumor looks like a piece of red cauliflower growing off the wall of the bladder. The tumor is vascular and hematuria is common. The most common cause of bladder tumors is smoking.

Bladder cancers usually start from the cells lining the bladder (transitional cells).

**These tumors are classified based on the way they grow:**  
**Papillary tumors-** They have a wart-like appearance and are attached to a stalk.  
**Nonpapillary (sessile) tumors**\- These tumors are flat and much less common. However, they are more invasive and have a worse outcome.

**TB for Bladder Cancer-who would have thought?**  
**Bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy:** Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is the most effective intravesical immunotherapy for treating early-stage bladder cancer. BCG is a bacterium that is related to the germ that causes tuberculosis (TB), but it does not usually cause serious disease. BCG is put directly into the bladder through a catheter. The body’s immune system cells are attracted to the bladder and activated by BCG, which in turn affects the bladder cancer cells. Treatment is usually started a few weeks after a transurethral resection of the tumor and is given once a week for 6 weeks. Sometimes long-term maintenance BCG therapy is given.
