DSUVIA (sufentanil sublingual tablets)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### DSUVIA (sufentanil sublingual tablets)

The FDA approved DSUVIA for hospital settings only!  
  
**Advantages:  
**Quick onset and bypasses first-pass hepatic effect  
IV not required  
Has battlefield applications  
  
**Special Notes from experienced anesthesia providers:**  
For a surgical procedure expected to be ≤ 60 minutes, administer 30 minutes prior to procedure.  
For procedures > 60 minutes, administer 20 minutes prior to extubation.   
Anesthesia providers have noticed the requirement of less narcotics and inhalation agent after the administration of Dsuvia.  
**Onset:**  About 15 minutes.  
**Duration:** 3 hours  
  
**Class:** Opioid agonist  
**Indications:** Management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.  
**MOA:** Selective opioid agonist for the mu-receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses.  
Typically dissolve within 5  minutes (sublingual)  
**Onset:** Rapid and analgesic threshold is usually reached by 30 minutes.  
**Duration:** Remains above threshold for 3 hours.  
  
**Possibilities of DSUVIA**  
Could replace PCA intravenous morphine or fentanyl.  
Can be useful in hospitalized post-operative patients following major, painful surgeries such as orthopedic total joint replacements or intra-abdominal surgeries.  
If sublingual sufentanil reaches the streets as a drug of abuse, it can be lethal.  
  
**Recommended dose of DSUVIA:**  
30 mcg sublingually as needed with a minimum of 1 hour between doses.  
Do not exceed 12 tablets in 24 hours.  
**The maximum cumulative daily dose:** 360 mcg or 12 tablets (12 tablets x 30 mcg/dose).  
**_Not for use for more than 72 hours.  
The use of DSUVIA beyond 72 hours has not been studied._**  
  
**Drug Interactions**  
**Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics:**  
Avoid the use with DSUVIA because they may reduce analgesic effect of DSUVIA or  
precipitate withdrawal symptoms  
  
**Pharmacodynamics  
Central Nervous System  
**Respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers.  
The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation.  
Sufentanil causes miosis, even in total darkness.  
Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings).  
Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.  
  
**Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle**  
Reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum.  
Digestion in the small intestine is delayed.  
Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation.  
Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.  
  
**Cardiovascular System  
**Peripheral vasodilation, orthostatic hypotension or syncope  
Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension.  
  
**Endocrine System  
**Inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans.  
They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon.  
  
**Respiratory System**Dose-dependent respiratory depression  
The risk is less in patients receiving chronic opioid therapy who develop tolerance to respiratory depression and other opioid effects.  
  
**Pharmacokinetics**  
**Absorption of DSUVIA:  
**A single sublingual administration has a bioavailability of approximately 53% relative to a one minute IV sufentanil infusion of 30 mcg.  
Compared to IV administration, sublingual Cmax values were 17-fold lower.  
The sublingual route of administration of sufentanil avoids intestinal and hepatic first-pass effects.  
Steady-state plasma concentrations achieved after 7 doses.  
  
**Elimination of a single dose:**  
**Mean terminal half-life:** 13.4 hours  
**Mean apparent plasma clearance:** 108 L/hour.  
  
**Metabolism:**    
The liver and small intestine are the major sites of biotransformation.  
  
**Excretion:**  
80% of the IV administered dose of sufentanil is excreted within 24 hours and only 2% of the dose is eliminated as unchanged drug.  
  
Plasma concentrations of sublingual sufentanil reached the analgesic threshold by 30 minutes and stayed above threshold for approximately 3 hours  
  
**Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interactions**  
The concomitant use of DSUVIA with all cytochrome **_P450 3A4 inhibitors_** may result in an **increase** in sufentanil plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer may result in an increase in sufentanil plasma concentration. Monitor patients receiving DSUVIA and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer.  
  
Concomitant use of DSUVIA with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g. _erythromycin_ ), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., _ketoconazole_ ), and protease inhibitors (e.g., _ritonavir_ ), may increase plasma concentrations of sufentanil and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as _rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin,_ in DSUVIA-treated patients may increase sufentanil plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions.  
  
Concomitant use of DSUVIA with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inhibitor could decrease sufentanil plasma concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to sufentanil. When using DSUVIA with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals for adequate analgesia and for symptoms of opioid withdrawal  
  
**Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or other CNS Depressants:**  
Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of DSUVIA with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol).  
Depressant drugs with opioid analgesics.  
If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.  
  
**Serotonin Syndrome with Concomitant Use of Serotonergic Drugs**  
Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of sufentanil, the active opioid ingredient of DSUVIA, with serotonergic drugs.  
_Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs),_  
_tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (e.g., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAO inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue)_ . This may occur at the recommended dosage.  
  
Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days of concomitant use, but may occur later than that. Discontinue DSUVIA if serotonin syndrome is suspected.  
  
**Adrenal Insufficiency**  
Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers.  
  
**Severe Hypotension**  
DSUVIA may cause severe hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in _ambulatory patients._  
There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics)  
Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating DSUVIA. In patients with circulatory shock, DSUVIA may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of DSUVIA in patients with circulatory shock.  
  
**Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness**  
In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), DSUVIA may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression.  
Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of DSUVIA in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. _DSUVIA is not suitable for use in patients who are not alert and able to follow directions._  
  
**Risks of use in patients with gastrointestinal conditions**  
DSUVIA is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.  
The sufentanil in DSUVIA may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase.  
  
**Increased risk of seizures in patients with seizure disorders**  
The sufentanil in DSUVIA may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures.  
  
**Bradycardia**  
DSUVIA may produce bradycardia in some patients. Monitor patients with brady-arrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with DSUVIA.  
  
**Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome**  
Prolonged use of DSUVIA during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.  
  
**Other Reported Adverse Reactions**  
**Cardiac:** Sinus tachycardia, bradycardia.  
**Gastrointestinal:** Constipation, dyspepsia, flatulence, diarrhea, dry mouth, eructation, retching, abdominal discomfort, abdominal distension, abdominal pain upper, gastritis, postoperative ileus.  
**Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue:** Muscle spasms.  
**Nervous System:** Somnolence, sedation, presyncope, lethargy, memory impairment.  
**Psychiatric:** Insomnia, confusion, anxiety, agitation, disorientation, euphoric mood, hallucination, mental status changes.  
**Renal and Urinary:** Urinary retention, urinary hesitation, oliguria, renal failure.  
**Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal:** Hypoxia, bradypnea, hiccups, apnea, atelectasis, hypoventilation, respiratory distress, respiratory failure.  
**Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue:** Pruritus, hyperhidrosis, rash.  
**Vascular:** Hypotension, hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, flushing.  
  
**Contraindications of DSUVIA**  
Significant respiratory depression.  
Acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment.  
Known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.  
Known hypersensitivity to sufentanil or components of DSUVIA.  
  
**Warnings and Precautions**  
Accidental ingestion or exposure to even one dose of DSUVIA, especially in children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of sufentanil.  
  
DSUVIA is for use in adult patients only in a certified medically supervised healthcare setting. Use of DSUVIA outside of this setting can increase the risk of accidental exposure in others for whom it is not prescribed, causing fatal respiratory depression. Discontinue use of DSUVIA prior to discharge or transfer from the certified medically supervised healthcare setting. DSUVIA is not for home or pediatric use.  
  
DSUVIA contains sufentanil, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, DSUVIA exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse.  
  
Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of DSUVIA with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.  
  
Life-threatening respiratory depression in patients with chronic pulmonary disease or in elderly, cachectic and debilitated patients: monitor patients closely, particularly when initiating DSUVIA therapy and when DSUVIA is used with other drugs that depress respiration. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status  
  
A potentially life-threatening condition could result from concomitant serotonergic drug administration.  
Discontinue DSUVIA if serotonin syndrome is suspected.  
Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use (usually > 1 month).  
Presentation and symptoms are non-specific and include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness and low blood pressure.  
Confirm diagnosis with testing as soon as possible and, if confirmed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids and wean patient from opioid.  
  
As with all opioids, sufentanil may produce bradycardia or hypotension in some patients.  
Therefore DSUVIA should be used with caution in patients with brady-arrhythmias or hypovolemia.  
  
DSUVIA should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention, such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness or coma.  
  
Prolonged use of DSUVIA during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate, which can be life-threatening. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of this risk and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.  
  
Insufficient data are available on the use of DSUVIA in patients with severe liver or kidney impairment. DSUVIA should be used with caution in such patients due to the importance of these organs in the metabolism and excretion of sufentanil.
