**OLV and Lateral Decubitus Position**  
_By Daniel Perez, CRNA, Kaiser Orange County California_

Inset a roll under the torso just caudal to axilla to prevent compression of the neurovascular bundle and forward rotation of the humeral head.

Hyper-abduction is prevented to keep brachial plexus from stretching against humeral head.

Pulse oximetry or frequent palpation of radial pulse ensures integrity of circulation to the dependent arm.

Maintain head alignment to prevent compression of the jugular veins or vertebral arteries–compression may decrease cerebral circulation.

**For a Patient Awake in the lateral position:**  
Abdominal contents displace diaphragm in a cephalad direction.

Dependent hemi-diaphragm starts from a high position; contraction of the diaphragm leads to an increased tidal volume to fill the dependent lung (bottom lung).

**Dependent Lung**  
Perfusion is greatest in the dependent lung.  
Gas exchange remains effective; V/Q is unchanged while awake.

**Anesthetized patient in the lateral position while the chest is not open and spontaneously breathing:**  
Decreased FRC (immediately upon induction).

Cephalad displacement of diaphragm by abdominal contents causing a decreased FRC in dependent lung and a proportional decrease of zone 3 (favorable).

As the dependent lung’s FRC decreases, the volume and compliance also decreases.

**FRC in nondependent (upper) lung** - ventilation if preferentially distributed to nondependent lung, but blood flow is preferentially flowing to the dependent lung leading to a V/Q mismatch.

**Anesthetized patient, lateral position, paralyzed and mechanically ventilated:**  
Large decrease in FRC  
Compression from abdominal viscera is no longer countered by force of contracting diaphragm.  
Ventilation is greater in the nondependent lung due to a path of least resistance causing a V/Q mismatch  
Add PEEP to help restore FRC & improve V/Q

**Anesthetized open chest:**  
Once the chest is opened, there is a decrease in the resistance of gas flow to the nondependent lung by detaching the lung from the pleural connection to the chest wall.  
Decrease in ventilation to dependent lung.  
Downward shift of mediastinum from loss of intrapleural pressure in nondependent lung.  
Decrease ventilation to the dependent lung from the downward compression of the mediastinum structures.  
Decreased CO & circulatory compromise.  
Positive pressure ventilation minimizes these effects.
