### Epidurals - Problems that may be Encountered when Administering

If you have an obstruction and cannot inject the local anesthetic through the epidural catheter, first make sure your connector is correctly placed, then check for kinks in the catheter.  
  
If the connector is attached properly and there is no kink in the catheter, the only solution is to replace the epidural.  
  
If there is leaking from the skin, you are probably not in the epidural space and need to replace the epidural.  
  
_War story: I once replaced a perfectly functional catheter only to find out that the obstruction was in the filter. One more in the list of differential diagnoses._
