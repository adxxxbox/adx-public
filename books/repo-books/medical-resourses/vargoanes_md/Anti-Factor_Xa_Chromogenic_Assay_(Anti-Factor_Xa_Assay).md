Anti-Factor Xa Chromogenic Assay (Anti-Factor Xa Assay)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Anti-Factor Xa Chromogenic Assay (Anti-Factor Xa Assay)

Anti-factor Xa testing measures the concentration of Xa inhibitors.  
  
_This test is also useful in patients receiving LMWHs, UFH and Fondaparinux (Arixtra)._  
  
Anti-Factor Xa (Anti-Xa) assays can specifically determine the anticoagulant activity of UFH by measuring the ability of heparin-bound Antithrombin (AT) to inhibit a single enzyme, Factor Xa (FXa).  
  
**Common Xa inhibitors**  
Apixaban (Eliquis)  
Exdoxaban (Lixana, Savaysa)  
Fondaparinux (Arixtra)  
Rivaroxaban (Xerelto)  
  
**Summary:** Anti-Factor Xa Assay tests are not universally available due the lack of demand, price, and the fact that standardization of the anti-FXa assay across reagents and methods is not easily achieved.  
  
Since this newer class of anticoagulants are pharmacokinetically and pharmacodynamically predictable and reliable, monitoring is not recommended in the large majority of patients. For this reason, laboratory equipment for monitoring these drugs is not universally available in all medical institution. In fact, there is not an abundance of literature on Anti-Factor Xa Assay testing for Xa inhibitors.  
  
A limitation is that standardization of the anti-FXa assay across reagents and methods is not easily achieved  
**  
A PT assay is more accessible**  
A PT assay with a plain thromboplastin can be used to determine the relative intensity of anticoagulation caused by rivaroxaban, e.g. in an emergency or urgent clinical scenario.  
  
**PT Test is also more accessible but less reliable  
**The PT is not accurately linear to the levels of Xa inhibitors, but the elevation of PT levels is present with Xa inhibitors when an overdose is suspected.  
At this time, PT testing is much more accessible despite the lack of linear correlation.  
The PT is not sensitive enough to reliably measure low concentrations of rivaroxaban.
