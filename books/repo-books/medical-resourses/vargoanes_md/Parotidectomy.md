### Parotidectomy-Radical, Total or Superficial

Usually a parotidectomy is to remove cancerous tumors in the parotid gland. Among the tumors seen in the parotid gland are lymphoma, melanoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. Sometimes these tumors can be removed for benign reasons.

The parotid gland is the largest of the salivary glands. There are two parotid glands, one on each side of the face. They lie just in front of the ears and a duct runs from each to the inside of the cheek. Each parotid gland has several lobes.    

All five branches of the facial nerve run though the Parotid gland.

**Total:** Removal of a tumor or area medial to the facial nerve. Goal is to preserve facial nerve function.

**Radical:** Removal of the entire gland and the facial nerve.  
**Superficial (localized):** Removal of the entire gland lateral to the facial nerve. This preserves facial nerve function.

  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
Tape the ETT to the opposite side of the surgeon’s stance.  
**Paralysis:** Check with the surgeon. The surgeon may want facial nerve monitoring.  
No paralysis is permitted with facial nerve monitoring.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
**Facial Nerve Monitoring:** Sometimes.  
**Duration:** 2-4 hours.  
**Position:** Supine, one or both arms tucked. The bed may be rotated 90 degrees.  
**EBL:** Usually minimal. Some surgeons may request you to avoid hypertension since the gland is in a vascular area.  
**Emergence:** Smooth-avoid coughing.

Mandibular  
Cervical

**More Notes:**

Superficial or localized parotidectomy is recommended unless the pathology is a lipoma or if a Warthin's tumor is present. One of the advantages to this approach is that nerves to the facial muscles are left intact. Many facial nerves run through the same area as the parotid gland and can be damaged during a more complete parotidectomy. 

**Possible Complications:** 

Transection of Facial nerve with resultant paralysis.  
Rupture of tumor with following of hemorrhage or hematoma.  
Infection  
Skin flap necrosis.  
Cosmetic deformity.  
Trismus or Lockjaw: related to inflammation and fibrosis of the masseter muscle.  
Parotid Fistula.  
Hypoesthesia of greater auricular nerve.
