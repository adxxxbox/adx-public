Treacher Collins and Anesthesia   

### Treacher Collins and Anesthesia

  
(mandibulofacial dysostosis or Franceschetti syndrome)  
_JoVanna Eisenbarth MS, CRNA, Mason General Hospital, Shelton, WA_

Treacher Collins is a genetic syndrome consisting of craniofacial birth defects—primarily affecting the cheekbones, eyes, mouth and ears.

  
**Our biggest anesthetic concerns are:**  
Difficult mask ventilation and intubation.

Eye care and protection- due to incompetence to the eyelids.  
Post -operative complications from pharyngeal and laryngeal edema.  
During the post-operative period, pharyngeal and laryngeal edema may develop. Even respiratory distress and sudden death has been reported.

**Multiple surgical procedures with Treacher Collins Syndrome**

Correction of cleft lip and palate (present up to 35%)  
Placement of cochlear implant (40% have hearing loss in both ears)  
Placement and removal of mandibular distractors  
Plastic surgery for cheeks, orbits or ear.  
**Pre-operative Assessment  
**Important question an anesthetist can ask pertains to the degree of airway involvement.  
Do they suffer from sleep apnea?  
Respiratory problems?  
Swallowing and eating difficulties?  
Gastrostomy Tube? For severe swallowing difficulty.  
Has the patient had a distraction osteogenesis procedure?  
Distraction osteogenesis can be performed on TCS neonates today to lengthen the mandible.  
Craniofacial or temporomandibular joint abnormalities?  
Mask ventilation and tracheal intubation can be difficult or even impossible to achieve, especially with temporomandibular joint abnormalities.

There are uncommon incidences of patients with TCS also having cardiac malformations, and cervical vertebral fusion; therefore a full history and physical is essential.

The airway of those with TCS is said to change with age.  
_Direct laryngoscopy becomes more difficult with increasing age._

An airway assessment is vital to every anesthetic.

**Why a Difficult Intubation?**

**Macroglossia** (large tongue) - In this case, there is usually a normal sized tongue, but appears very large in relation to the hypoplastic mandible.  
**Retrognathia** - either or both jaws recede with respect to the frontal plane of the forehead. The mandible can be lengthened with a Distraction osteogenesis procedure.  
**Other contributing problems:**  
Limited mouth opening  
Reduced extension of the head on the neck

Limited forward movement of the hyoid  
Mandibular and facial skeletal abnormalities.  
  
The above listed reduces the space available for manipulation and insertion of the ETT. Often multiple abnormalities may be present in any individual case.

Consider an awake fiberoptic intubation for patients with the any of the above airway difficulties.  
  
Careful planning with emergency backup plans, are important in achieving a successful intubation and maintaining airway patency.

_Your goal is to avoid a “cannot ventilate, cannot intubate” situation._

Current research studies have shown that fiberoptic nasal intubation or a Glide Scope intubation is the trend for intubating TCS patients today.

**_Below is a list of various methods published for TCS airway management_**  
**  
Back up difficult airway equipment:**  
Fiberoptic  
Emergency tracheostomy kit- A surgeons should be nearby for emergency  
in event of complete loss of the airway with failed intubation.  
FastTrach LMA-older literature  
Glide Scope- newer literature  
Oral Airway  
Nasopharyngeal airway  
Lubrication

**Pre-operative Medication**  
Versed-standard dose  
Robinul-0.1-0.2mg/kg  
Dexamethasone 4-8mg  
Have 2-3 experience anesthesia providers present on induction.  
  
**Preoxygentate** for 3-5 minutes  
  
**Inhalation Induction:**  
Inhalation induction with Sevoflurane (if no IV access at the time)

Keep the patient spontaneously breathing

Immediately start an IV with no muscle relaxation.  
Keep in a deeper plane of anesthesia for ample time to attempt intubation.  
  
Low doses of propofol can also be used if the Sevoflurane is not adequate to keep the patient from resisting.

**Mask Ventilation may be very difficult**  
Improvement has been shown with the assistance of another anesthesia provider by a forward lift of both the angles of the mandible.

**Oral Airway:** Can be used, but sometimes not helpful. The application of gauze bilaterally against the cheeks has shown some improvement.  
  
**Nasopharyngeal airway:** Have been useful clinically, but some literature has also stated that they have a limited effect on the improvement of the airway patency.

_You may need more staff to hold the patient’s arms and legs down during intubation._ It may be a major challenge for you to manage an uncooperative child with such a congenital airway anomaly.

**LMA insertion**  
LMA insertion is well documented as the best method utilized when intubation is not required. Unfortunately, it is also well documented that TCS patient’s airways are sometimes too narrow for the insertion of an LMA. So be prepared for plan B.  
**LMA Fast Trach as a conduit for blind or fiberoptic intubation**

The use of a LMA Fastrach has also been documented, followed by a blind or fiberoptic intubation. However, removing the LMA without dislodging the ETT has also been documented.  
  
**MAC vs Miller Blade  
**A straight blade has been successfully used after a mac blade was unsuccessful.

**Direct Laryngoscopy**  
It is common for a laryngoscopy to show a Class IV of glottis visualization as per Cormack Lehane classification.  
Improvement has been documented by deepening the anesthesia and having the other anesthesia provider give a very good backward upward right­ward pressure (BURP). This has improved the laryngoscopy view to a class III.

**Glide Scope Intubation**  
Has been successfully documented.  

**Nasal Fiberoptic**  
Up to three anesthesia providers have been used for a Nasal Fiberoptic intubation.

One performing nasal fiberoptic intubation  
One maintaining oral mask ventilation with both hands  
One titrating the sevoflurane, IV medication and applying manual breaths as needed.

**Tracheostomy**  
Sometime after birth, a tracheostomy may be indicated if the TCS patient suffers from persistent difficult upper airway in consequence of a traumatic intubation. This is rare.

**Protect and lubricate the eyes  
**Perioperatvely, special care should be made regarding prevention of corneal abrasion for the patient with TCS, due to a degree of incompetence to the eyelids. Lubricate the eyes and securely cover/protect them.

**Prone position**  
While in the prone position, maxillary and zygomatic hyperplasia may increase the risk of orbital compression and perioperative blindness. Apply safety goggles if possible.

**Postoperative Airway edema** is possible and the patient should be closely monitored for all signs and symptoms of respiratory compromise. IV decadron should be administered prophylactically.

**More Notes**  
Cleft palate is usually repaired at approximately age 10-12 months, but can be delayed if airway concerns exist.

**Ear correction:** Microtia (external portion of the ear is malformed) can be repaired later in life. The ear is constructed in 3 stages; the first stage is the most involved.  
**The Le Fort osteotomy II** is performed to derotate the middle face with the nasofrontal junction as the fulcrum. The maxilla and nasal bones are disjoined from the cranium to shorten the anterior midface, while lengthening the posterior facial height.

**Retrognathia** - either or both jaws recede, with respect to the frontal plane of the forehead. The mandible can be lengthened with a distraction osteogenesis procedure.
