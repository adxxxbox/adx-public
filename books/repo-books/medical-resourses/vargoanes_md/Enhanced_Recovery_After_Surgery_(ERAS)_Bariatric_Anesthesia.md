### Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Bariatric Anesthesia

**Note:** ERAS protocols vary among institutions.  
  
Confirm case posting for ERAS protocol.**  
  
Room set-up  
**60 ml syringe of normal saline for flush.  
**  
Equipment for subcostal TAP blocks:**  
Ultrasound  
4” & 6” block needle and 60 mL 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine (1:400k).   
  
**Medications to draw up and room set-up**  
Dexamethasone 10 mg IV (if not given in pre op holding)  
Ketamine 50 mg  
Haldol 2mg IV post induction  
Midazolam (Versed®) 2mg IV  
Fentanyl 100 mcg  
Antibiotics  
Propofol/lidocaine  
Muscle relaxants  
Forced Air Warming Blanket (after prep and drape).  
**Note:** If not contraindicated, consider induction with rocuronium in preference to succinylcholine to avoid abdominal muscle activity during transverse abdominis plane (TAP) blocks.  
  
**Ambulatory care unit (ACU) hand-off  
**Review chart to determine if the patient has taken celocoxib (Celebrex®) or acetaminophen (Tylenol®). Avoid acetaminophen (Ofirmev®) and ketorolac (Toradol®) if already taken.  
Standard pre-procedure check-off.  
Confirm pump tubing and fluids on pump at 25 ml/hr in ACU.  
Confirm patient received 1,000 mL IV fluid bolus.  
Limit pre-op sedation: goal < 2mg midazolam IV.  
ERAS post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) prophylaxis (scopolamine).   
ERAS multimodal analgesics (gabapentin).  
Confirm deep venous thrombosis (VTE) /deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis (sequential compression device / subcutaneous heparin if indicated.   
Confirm that perioperative glycemic control order set has been activated (if diabetic patient).  
**Continuous infusion settings:  
Laparoscopic:** 3 mL/kg (ideal body weight)  
**Open procedure:** 5 mL/kg (ideal body weight)  
  
**Intra-op, prior to incision  
**Reverse Trendelenburg for intubation, if possible.Ketamine (0.5mg/kg) with induction, then 10mg Q 1 hour (no fentanyl).  
Magnesium 2gm IV (over 10 min).  
Administer antibiotic.   
Ketamine 0.5mg/kg IV Q1 hour to a maximum of 160 mg.  
IV acetaminophen (Ofirmev®) 1 g IV (15 mg/kg) 1 g if acetaminophen not used pre-op.  
Establish fluid administration as directed by institutional protocol.   
Forced air warming blanket (after prep and drape).  
**Ventilator settings:** Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV); TV around 6ml/kg TV); PEEP 5-8, permissive hypercapnia, if possible.  
Bilateral Subcostal TAP blocks, 20mL/bilaterally.   
  
**Intra-op and maintenance  
**Reverse Trendelenburg intubation, if possible.  
1 Liter LR to be administered during case.500 ml crystalloid bolus or 250 mL of 5% albumin if needed as directed by institutional protocol.  
**Note:** Many anesthesia providers start the 500 cc bolus using the pump (flow rate 999 ml/hr with 500ml volume to be infused–VTBI) prior to induction.  
**Ventilator:** Pressure controlled ventilation with tidal volume 6ml/kg.  
Maintain normothermia.  
Limit fentanyl to 100 mcg if possible.  
Avoid or limit Fentanyl (Goal less than 100 mcg).  
  
**Blood Glucose Monitoring**  
**Diabetic patient**  
Baseline check 60 minutes post induction or 60 minutes after last check in ACU (diabetic patients).  
Check blood sugars Q 1 hour and follow institution sliding scale.  
  
**Non-diabetic patients** :  
Check blood sugar within 60 minutes after induction.  
Maintain blood glucose between 100-180 mg/dl.  
Check blood glucose Q2hr (“finger stick” or other sampling technique).**  
  
Closing and emergence**  
Ondansetron (Zofran®) 4mg IV.  
Awake extubation in the OR.  
Ketorolac (if ok with surgeon and the patient has normal renal function; 30 mg IV pts <65 years; 15 mg IV >65 years.Pulmonary recruitment (complete lung expansion) prior to extubation.  
  
**PONV prophylaxis:**  Ondansetron 4 mg IV at emergence.Awake extubation with head of bed up.  
  
**Post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) hand-off  
**Inform PACU RN that ERAS protocol was followed.  
Report last blood glucose measurement, time and intervention.  
Report last antibiotic dose and time.  
Report acetaminophen /Ketolorac dose and time.  
SCDs from PACU arrival until discharge–while in bed or chair.
