### Breast Lumpectomy- Wire Guided or Needle-Directed

This is another type of lumpectomy.  
It has 2 parts: first, in radiology, a wire is inserted in the breast tissues under fluoroscopic guidance. Then the patient goes to Pre-op prior to surgery. This procedure ensures greater accuracy of containment for a breast biopsy or lumpectomy

**Part 1:** In radiology, the radiologist threads a thin strong wire through a needle so that the tip will rest in the target tissue. This enables the surgeon to remove the correct tissue. Usually this is done without any sedation.

**Part 2:** The patient will then arrive to pre-op with either a Styrofoam cup or a protective dressing over the wire. Whatever you do, DON’T mess with it. If the surgeon believes the placement was altered, he/she will cancel the case. The surgical site does not need marked by the surgeon.

**Anesthetic:** General/LMA  
The surgeon usually has to excise deeper within the breast tissue with increasing  
stimulation, so a MAC case may not be sufficient.  
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes  
**Position:** Supine with arms out  
**EBL:** 10-20 mLs  
**IV Access:** 20G  
  
Make sure your EKG leads are somewhere on the patient’s back or shoulder, as long as they are not near the surgical site.  
BP cuff should be on the side away from the surgical area, only because the surgeon may feel it’s too close to the lateral breast or his exposed sterile field.
