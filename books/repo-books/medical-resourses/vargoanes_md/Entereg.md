# Entereg

**Entereg (Alvimopan)**  
Peripherally-acting, mu-opioid receptor (PAMOR) antagonist.  
Oral only  
**Dose:** 12mg Pill 30 minutes to 5 hours prior to surgery followed by 12 mg twice daily beginning the day after surgery for a maximum of 7 days or until discharge. Patients should not receive more than 15 doses of Entereg.  
**Indications:**  
For patients to avoid postop ileus following partial large or small bowel resection with primary anastomosis.  
It accelerates the GI recovery period as defined by time to first bowel movement or flatus.  
Preventing an extra day at the hospital commonly caused by opioid induced ileus/constipation.  
Entereg is only for short-term use by hospitalized patients.  
**MOA**  
It competitively antagonizes the peripheral effects of opioids on GI motility and secretion by competitively binding to the GI tract mu-opioid receptors.  
It does not reverse the central analgesic effects of u-opioid antagonists because it does NOT cross the blood brain barrier.  
Sometimes Anesthesia gets stuck giving it PO just prior to induction when the pre-op order was missed by the nurse. Some surgeons will not start surgery without it given.  
No IV form yet.  
Should be taken shortly before bowel surgery.  
**Absorption**  
Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of Entereg is reached 2 hours after oral dosing, while the Cmax for metabolite occurs 36 hours after an oral dose.  
**Contraindications**  
For patients who have taken therapeutic doses of opioids for more than 7 consecutive days immediately prior to taking ENTEREG.  
**Myocardial infarction**  
During clinical trials, a 12 month study of Entereg dosed at 0.5 mg twice daily reported observed more MI's in the treatment group compared to placebo. The majority of these events occurred between months one and four of treatment. No causal relationship between Entereg and MI was ever established, and this effect has not been reproduced in subsequent studies.
