### Placenta Accreta

Placenta accreta is a milder type of placental invasion.  
Placental invasions are caused by invasion of the myometrium by fetal trophoblasts from the placenta.  
  
This is a serious concern because after delivery, all of the placenta WILL NOT spontaneously separate from the uterus and attempts at removal may result in postpartum hemorrhage.  
Refer to _“Postpartum Hemorrhage”_ for details.  
  
Placental invasions are a significant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality and are now the most common reason for emergent postpartum hysterectomy.  
  
**Hypothesis of etiology**  
The most favored is a defect of the endometrial-myometrial interface leading to a failure of normal decidualization in the area of a uterine scar, which allows abnormally deep placental anchoring of villi and trophoblast infiltration.  
  
**Three types of placental invasion:**  
**1) Placenta Accreta:** (63%)  
The placental chorionic villi attach deeply into the uterine wall (myometrium rather than the decidua).  
**Note:** The placental villi DO NOT penetrate the myometrium (uterine muscle).  
**_Accreta starts with the letter A, so it Attaches._**  
  
**2) Placenta Increta:** (15%)  
The placental chorionic villi invades or infiltrates the myometrium of the maternal uterus.  
**_Increta starts with the letter I, so it Invades/Infiltrates._**  
  
**3)** **Placenta Percreta:** (22%)  
The placental chorionic villi perforate (penetrate) myometrium or beyond the serosa or adjacent organs such as the bladder.  
**_Percreta starts with the letter P, so it Penetrates.  
_****Types of placental separation:  
Partial separation:** May cause postpartum hemorrhage resulting in hemorrhagic shock and DIC.  
**If no separation:** The manual separation may result in postpartum hemorrhage.  
  
**Incidence of placenta accreta:** Around 2/1000.  
**  
Risk factors for placenta accreta:  
**Previous uterine surgery  
Previous c-section  
Myomectomy (removal of uterine fibroids)  
D&C  
_Scar tissue prevents normal placental implantation_  
Previous placenta previa  
  
**Possible signs:  
**Placenta fails to spontaneously deliver after birth.  
Manual separation attempts are unsuccessful.  
Severe hemorrhage  
Boggy uterus unresponsive to uterotonics/uterine massage.  
  
**Diagnosis:** Usually based on clinical presentationDuring delivery, placenta accreta is suspected when:  
Placenta is retained after 30 minutes.  
Attempts at manual removal cannot create a plane of separation.  
Placental traction causes large-volume hemorrhage.  
When placenta accreta is suspected, laparotomy with preparation for large-volume hemorrhage is required.Prenatal diagnosis allows planned management (c-section and hysterectomy)  
  
**Imaging:** Ultrasound, color doppler or MRI  
Ultrasonography (US) remains the diagnostic standard, and routine US examination at 18-20 weeks’ gestation affords an ideal opportunity to screen for the disorder.  
It permits evaluation of alterations in intraplacental blood flow and the status of the placental-myometrial interface.  
**Note:** The absence of ultrasound findings does not preclude a diagnosis of placenta accreta  
  
**Labs:** May show an increase in maternal serum alpha fetoprotein.  
  
**Removal of retained placenta:  
**The third stage usually lasts between 30 and 60 minutes after fetal delivery.  
If the placenta has not been expelled within that hour it is said to be ‘retained’ and other measures may be required to remove it.  
  
**A retained placenta may be due to:**  
The uterus not contracting adequately after delivery and the placenta remaining fully or partially attached inside the uterus.  
Umbilical cord snapping.  
Placenta accreta, placenta increta or placenta percreta  
**The most generally accepted goal:** A cesarean hysterectomy with the placenta left in situ after delivery of the fetus (attempts at placental removal introduce significant risk of hemorrhage).  
  
Preparation for postpartum hemorrhage includes access to a blood bank capable of meeting the specifications of a massive transfusion protocol.  
  
Maximize preoperative hemoglobin values  
Verify specific timing of planned delivery.  
Arrange for a properly equipped surgical facility  
  
Consider use of a cell-saver for higher risk patients.  
Assess the availability of interventional radiology.  
Notify blood bank of scheduling or timing of procedure.  
  
For details of anesthesia management for retained placenta, refer to “Placenta (Retained) Removal” in “Case Tips” section of the Mega App.  
There should be close communication among all members of the care team.  
  
Uterine rupture  
Massive bleeding  
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
