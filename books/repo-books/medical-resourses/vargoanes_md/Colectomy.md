Colectomy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Colectomy

A colon resection, also known as a colectomy, is the surgical removal (resection) of a part or all of the large intestine (colon). Sometimes it is called a hemi-colectomy, partial colectomy, or a segmental resection of the colon. It can also involve the removal of the nearby lymph nodes.

Resection of any part of the colon entails mobilization and ligation of the corresponding blood vessels. The surgeon will re-anastomose the colon. If it’s impossible to reconnect the colon, the surgeon creates a stoma in the abdominal wall (colostomy or ileostomy) through which feces passes from the body into a disposable collection bag.

   
**Indications:** Bowel obstruction, diverticulitis, cancer and colitis.  
These procedures today are mostly laparoscopic, sometimes open. If laparoscopic (not open belly), you WON’T have to hydrate the patient as much nor worry about insensible water loss.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
**RSI:** Always- if it’s related to bowel obstruction.  
**Nitrous Oxide:** No  
**Thoracic Epidural:** Sometimes, not as common anymore. Helps for post op pain.  
**Duration:** 1-3 hours  
**A-Line:** Usually not indicated.  
**IV Access:** 1 18G for a laparoscopic, and usually 2 IVs for an open procedure.  
**Typed and Cross**: Yes: if it is an open procedure, you should have 2 PRBS on stand-by. Check with the surgeon.  
**EBL:** <100mLs  
**OG Tube:** Yes, unless they want an NG tube. NG tubes are becoming more rare for these procedures. Ask the surgeon.  
**Position:** Supine and steep Trendelenburg if it’s a laparoscopic procedure.  
**Bowel Prep:** Usually; the patients are dry.  
**Fluid Deficit:** 1-2 liters from a bowel prep, and from being NPO.  
  
**More Notes:**  
Thoracic epidural anesthesia pain relief has a significant and favorable impact on dietary tolerance and length of stay after surgery. However, we are seeing less epidurals inserted for colectomies than in the past.  
 

The large intestine consists of five main sections: the ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, and the sigmoid colon, ending with the rectum.

**Possible Complications
