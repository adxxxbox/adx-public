### Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device (CIED) Algorithm

**![](cieda_001.png)**

**Warning with central line insertions:  
**The guidewires used with central line insertions may cause mechanical interference near the CIED sensing electrodes resulting in ventricular oversensing, causing an inappropriate shock in a patient with an ICD or inhibition of a necessary pacing function.  
  
Also, atrial oversensing in a dual-chamber pacing mode may occur, leading to ventricular tracking and inappropriately rapid ventricular pacing.   
  
Actual physical contact between the guidewire and the right ventricular rate sensor has been reported to cause an electrical short with irreversible damage to the CIED generator.
