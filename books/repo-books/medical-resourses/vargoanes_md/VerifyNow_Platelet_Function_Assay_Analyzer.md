VerifyNow Platelet Function Assay Analyzer    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### VerifyNow Platelet Function Assay Analyzer

Whole blood is added to a selected cartridge which contains fibrinogen-coated beads and a specific agonist. The agonist will either activate unblocked platelet receptors or provide a stimulus otherwise inhibited by the antiplatelet agent, resulting in aggregation of functional (non-inhibited) platelets. The level of platelet inhibition is based on the amount of apparent fibrinogen binding in the assay.  
  
VerifyNow has 3 different assays to measure the level of inhibited platelet function from commonly used anti-platelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel and IIb/IIIa antagonists).  
  
**The 3 are below:  
**PRU Test  
IIb/IIIa Test  
Aspirin Test  
  
**PRU Tests  
**Measures the P2Y12 platelet receptor blockade  
Expressed in P2Y12 reaction units (PRU)  
Clopidogrel (Palix)  
Prasugrel (Effient)  
Ticagrelor (Brilinta)  
  
**IIb/IIIa Test  
**Measures the patient response to IIb/IIIa inhibitors  
Eptifibatide (Integrilin) - _inject blood specimen into heparinized tube_  
Abciximab (Reopro) - _inject blood specimen into citrated tubes_  
  
This test may also use another agonist - Thrombin Receptor Agonist Peptide (“TRAP”) which will activate platelets through a thrombin receptor independently of P2Y12 inhibiting drugs.  
This provides a baseline value (BASE) for platelet function.  
  
**Aspirin Test  
**Measures platelet response to arachidonic acid effecting drugs  
aspirin  
  
**Blood sample from indwelling catheter:  
**Discard the first 5 ml and insert 2 ml in syringe and gently invert the tube at least 5 times.  
  
**Disadvantages of VerifyNow Test  
**VerifyNow has specific tests for specific drugs ONLY.  
  
**Example:** A patient on GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor drugs can NOT be tested with a VerifyNow Aspirin or the VerifyNow PRU Test. It must be a VerifyNow IIb/IIIa Test.  
  
Evaluation of test results in patients with a platelet count < 100,000 or congenital platelet disorders (e.g. von Willebrand factor) lacks data.  
Prolonged incubation time with VerifyNow Aspirin Test
