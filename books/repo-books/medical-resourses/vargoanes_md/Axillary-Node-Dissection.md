Axillary Node Dissection and Notes     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

**Axillary Node Dissection and Notes**

Sentinel Lymph Nodes (SLN) are Axillary Nodes.  
A sentinel node is the first and central node that tumor cells drain into.

**_In any procedure that involves an Axillary Node Dissection, do NOT relax the patient!_**  
Why? The surgeon wants to see the muscles twitch, so he/she knows to stay away from the nerves close to the nodes. These are located per gentle stimulation with Bovie electrocautery or a surgical nerve stimulator. The surgeon does not want to damage these nerves, but wants to locate them to ligate their respected artery and vein.  
 

**Anesthetic: General/ETT  
Anesthetic Concerns: Location of BP cuff and IV site**  
Always avoid the affected side. Sometimes there are bilateral issues and it’s not uncommon to have an IV and BP cuff on a lower extremity. Make sure the cuff is over the ankle area and not the calf. The calf hurts a lot more.  
  
**Sentinel Lymph nodes:** A Sentinel node is any lymph node that receives lymph drainage directly from the tumor site; it may not be the first node encountered.  Any node that is stained blue from the dye, or is radioactive, should be removed until a 90% drop in total radioactive count is obtained.

**Sentinel Lymphadenectomy:** Excision of a single or small number of lymph nodes identified by staining or lymphoscintigraphy technology. See **Lymphadenectomy** and **Lymphoscintigraphy** for details.

**The nerves the surgeon avoids with Axillary Node Dissections**  
Long Thoracic Nerve  
Thoracodorsal Nerve  
Intercostobrachial Nerve

**Damage of the Long thoracic nerve (motor):** Can be seen specifically with radical mastectomies that involve removal of axillary lymph nodes. The damage leads to a winged scapula (scapula alata) from the paralysis of the serratus anterior muscle. This is most prominent when the arm is lifted forward or when the patient pushes the outstretched arm against a wall. However, even winging may not be evident until the trapezius stretches enough to reveal an injury several weeks later.

**Damage to the Thoracodorsal nerve (motor):** This injury results in a palsy of the latissimus dorsi muscle.

  
**Damage to the Intercostobrachial nerve (sensory):** This results in a numbness or pain in the lateral aspect of the axilla and the medial aspect of the upper arm.  
 

**Intercostabrachial Neuralgia aka post mastectomy pain syndrome or PMP):** pain in the axilla, medial upper arm and anterior chest wall.

  
**Lymphedema:**  
This complication occurs less frequently with the standard axillary dissections performed nowadays (level I and II). It is more frequently seen when an axillary dissection is combined with axillary radiation.
