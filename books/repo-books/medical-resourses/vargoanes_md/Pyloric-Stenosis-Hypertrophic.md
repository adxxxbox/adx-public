Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (HPS) Notes   

### Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (HPS) Notes

**Idiopathic Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (IHPS)**

**Pyloric sphincter:** A muscle at the junction between the stomach outlet and the entrance of the duodenum.

HPS is a form of gastric outlet obstruction, which means a blockage from the stomach to the intestines. This is in result of hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the muscular layers of the pylorus. The stomach can no longer empty properly and may lead to projectile vomiting over a distance of several feet.  
  
With protracted vomiting, the emesis may become blood-tinged because of gastritis.

These patients typically present with non-bilious projectile vomiting and weight loss. The vomit is non-bilious because the pyloric obstruction prevents entry of duodenal contents (containing bile) into the stomach.  
  
**Initial Diagnosis**  
Typically, the infant is malnourished with hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, occasionally with severe deficits of potassium and sodium. Hyperbilirubinemia is present in about 5%.  
  
The baby may have a palpable, firm, movable mass ("olive") in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen and visible intestinal peristalsis. An abdominal ultrasound is done to observe peristaltic activity and to rule out pylorospasm for confirmation.  
Pyloric muscle thickness > 4mm and pyloric length > 16mm is a good confirmation

Sometimes an upper GI is done (with Barium) if the ultrasound is inconclusive.

The baby is admitted to the NICU and stabilized by correcting the dehydration, acid/base and electrolyte imbalances. This usually takes 1-2 days. Babies generally do not have clearance for surgery until the above are corrected.  
  
**Pre- op -recommended labs before surgery  
**pH: Between 7.3-7.5  
K: > 3.0mEq/L  
Na>130  
Chloride: > 85 mEq/L  
Hb>10 gmBicarbonate: > 30 mmole/L  
Urine Output: 1-2mLs/kg/hr  
Specific Gravity: < 1.020

**Surgical Correction:  
**Surgical correction was first performed by a German Physician, Dr Ramstedt, ~back~ in 1911. The procedure is known as a Ramstedt Pyloromyotomy. In this procedure, the muscle of the pylorus is divided to open up the gastric outlet. These procedures are now mostly being done laparoscopically (minimally invasive) because it’s proven to have a quicker recovery time. The open procedure involves a single incision usually 3–4 cm long.

**Cause:** unknown  
**Occurs:** 2-12 weeks of life (not born with it)  
**Male: Female** 4:1  
1 out of 500 births  
**Average age:** 1-12 weeks  
Incidence is 2 to 3-fold higher in African Americans than in whites, and it is rare in Asians. Pyloric stenosis is the most common cause of nonbilious vomiting and metabolic alkalosis in infants, as well as the most common reason for abdominal surgery in the first 6 months of life.

**The disorder has a familial tendency:**  
7% of children with this disorder have an affected parent.  
Among infants with HPS, the incidence of recurrence is 10% in subsequent male siblings and 2% in subsequent female siblings.

**Hypochloremic hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis  
**It seems like the first thing we are taught about HPS is the famous “Hypochloremic hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis.” This seems to all be corrected in the NICU before the time of surgery.

**Basically, the metabolic alkalosis is a result of 2 related but independent processes:**  
loss of acid  
retention of bicarbonate

Initially, persistent vomiting results in excessive loss of hydrogen chloride and potassium chloride (causing metabolic alkalosis).

  
**Another cause:** Normally, the carbonic acid in the stomach villi dissociates into hydrogen and bicarbonate. The H+ crosses the luminal membrane of the enterocyte and enters the stomach and is transported to the duodenum. Once in the duodenum, the acid stimulates the secretion of pancreatic bicarbonate.  
  
The normal stimulus for the pancreatic bicarbonate secretion from within the duodenum is now absent with pyloric stenosis due to the pyloric obstruction. The diminished secretion of bicarbonate into the GI tract (now being retained) contributes further to the metabolic alkalosis (created by stomach acid lost through vomiting).

As intravascular volume decreases from dehydration, the concentration of bicarbonate in the plasma naturally increases, resulting in alkalosis. The loss of potassium with persistent emesis also contributes to the metabolic alkalosis. As K+ concentrations drop from the emesis, potassium moves out of cells in an attempt to replace the lower extracellular levels. Extracellular H+ then moves into the cells to maintain electroneutrality. This causes a paradoxical extracellular alkalosis with intracellular acidosis. The serum K+ level sometimes look normal as the intracellular levels may be depleted.

**Respiratory Alkalosis  
**As the bicarbonate rises (see renal below), the body tries to compensate with  
hypoventilation to retain CO2. Therefore, an elevated PaCO2 is common.

**Renal**

To replenish volume from the fluid loss from persistent emesis, the kidneys reabsorb bicarbonate in the distal tubules despite the alkalosis.

When some of the excess bicarbonate is excreted in the urine, Na goes with it to maintain electroneutrality. Water follows Na excretion owing to further volume loss.  
  
In addition, decreased chloride levels are sensed by the macula densa of the kidneys resulting in renin release and secondary hyperaldosteronism. This leads to an increased distal hydrogen secretion so the baby may end up with paradoxical aciduria in the presence of metabolic alkalosis.

Another contributor to paradoxical aciduria is hypokalemia. In response to the low K+, the distal tubules of the kidneys will reabsorb more K+ in exchange for hydrogen, resulting in further loss of acid thus more alkalosis.

All the possible electrolyte abnormalities above depend on the duration of symptoms and compensatory stages the affected infant is in.

The dehydration may result in hypernatremia or hyponatremia and may result in prerenal renal failure.

The Hypochloremic hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis cycle is corrected by IV fluid replacement, usually with D5 in 0.45% saline at 1.5 times maintenance rate.
