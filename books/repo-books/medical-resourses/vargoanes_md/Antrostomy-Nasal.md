### Antrostomy - Intra-Nasal

Antrostomy means making an opening into the antrum, or the maxillary sinus.

**Antrostomy**: Is making an opening into the maxillary sinus for the purpose of re-establishing functional drainage. The surgeon may also remove polyps, cysts or excess tissue. When antibiotic management fails, surgery may be needed to treat and prevent chronic maxillary sinusitis. 

**Surgeon’s Goal:** Improve drainage of normal secretions, so less is retained to cause recurrent sinusitis. Normally there is no external excision; the surgery is done through the nostrils. Using specially designed fine bone cutting instruments, and powered suction debriding instruments when appropriate, the sinus openings are enlarged and anything blocking the sinuses such as swollen mucosa or polyps will be removed. The opening is made in the inferior nasal meatus. The surgeon usually injects a local anesthetic with epinephrine.  So watch the EKG for dysrhythmias and other cardiac changes.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT with an oral Rae and consider an LTA kit.  
**Muscle Relaxant:** Theoretically, the patient does not need to be relaxed, but we usually do to prevent coughing.  
**Inhalation Agent:** Sevo or Forane are popular for these procedures.

**Duration:** 45-90 minutes  
**EBL:** 10-50 mLs  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
**Positioning:** Supine with HOB up 10-20 degrees or reverse Trendelenburg. Tuck the arm on the side of the bed where the surgeon sits. Sometimes the bed is rotated 90 degrees.  

**Antiemetics:** Yes; Decadron and Zofran are OK.

**NGT:** For the surgeon to pass ORALLY after the throat pack is out.  
**Avoid hypertension:** To minimize bleeding, but stay within 20% of the patient’s base BP. Consider a beta- blocker with emergence. You can titrate your inhalation agent to the desired BP.  
**Emergence:** Smooth and avoid coughing. Xylocaine .25 mg/kg will suppress cough reflexes.

**Robinul:** Yes, give to prevent secretions from draining onto and agitating the vocal cords. Gently suction the oral pharynx with a catheter (not a Yankauer). At the end of the operation, it is common for the patient to have a nasal packing of sponge dressings in each nostril to soak up any blood. This is kept in for a few hours. The patient is now an obligate mouth breather.  
**Extubation:** Deep or Awake? Many CRNAs will extubate deep with the HOB elevated. Some patients may require an awake extubation, so try to make it smooth. Some CRNAs insert an LMA immediately after a deep extubation and transport the patient to the recovery room. The LMA is removed when the patient awakes. This drastically decreases turnover time.

**Possible Complications (same as Ethmoidectomy):**  
Bleeding  
Blindness  
Eye Muscle Injury.  
Spinal Fluid Leak.  
Meningitis  
Infection
