# Physostigmine

**Physostigmine (Antilirium)**  
Usually only stocked and administered in the PACU  
**Class:** Anticholinesterase  
It occurs naturally in the Calabar bean.  
**Tertiary Amine:** Yes, so it crosses the BBB, and its effective in antagonizing adverse CNS effects of certain drugs.  
**Dose IV/IM:** 0.5 to 1 mg; repeat at intervals of 2-10 minutes as indicated.  
**Postoperative shivering:** 40mcg/kg  
**Known Indications:**  
Central Anticholinergic Syndrome: (Post op)  
Opioids and Anesthetics Induced Somnolence  
Ketamine-CNS Effects  
Tricyclic Antidepressant Overdose-seizures  
**Note:** Neostigmine and Edrophonium are quaternary, so they do not cross the blood brain barrier.  
This anticholinesterase drug is effective in antagonizing restless and confusion (central anticholinergic syndrome) due to atropine or scopolamine.  
Physostigmine-increases the concentration of acetylcholine in the brain making more neurotransmitters available for interaction with cholinergic receptors.  
**The anticholinergic syndrome**  
Has both central and peripheral signs and symptoms. Central toxic effects include anxiety, delirium, disorientation, hallucinations, hyperactivity and seizures.  
**Opioids and Anesthetics Induced Somnolence**  
Physostigmine abolishes the somnolent effects of opioids and volatile anesthetics, and may reverse the depression of the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide.  
**Ketamine**  
Reversal of the adverse CNS effects of ketamine while analgesia remained intact as the documented.  
**Tricyclic Antidepressant Overdose**  
Known to terminate seizures and improve conduction.
