TPA (Tissue Plasminogen Activator) reversal    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### TPA (Tissue Plasminogen Activator) reversal

_Currently, there is a lack of specific antidotes for the growing number of new (novel) anticoagulants that are slowly replacing warfarin and heparin. For this reason, there is NO universal standard of care for the treatment of the anticoagulated bleeding patient when there is no specific antidote._

**Consult cardiology for ALL patients with coronary stents.**

**TPA Notes**  
\> 50% of TPA is cleared from plasma within 5 minutes after discontinuance of an IV infusion and approximately 80% is cleared within 10 minutes. It has a short half-life and therefore is usually administered as an intravenous bolus followed by an infusion.  
  
**Initial half-life:** 5 minutes (free, unbound form).  
**Terminal half-life:** 72 minutes. **Initial Treatment** Discontinue infusion or determine time infusion was discontinued.  
**Consider lab tests:** CBC and plasma fibrinogen.**  
  
Mild Bleed  
**Apply mechanical compression.  
**Antidote:** Amicar or tranexamic acid may be considered as an antidote.  
**Recommended Amicar dose:** 5 gm IV over 1 hr, then 1 gm/hr infusion.  
  
**Without Amicar or tranexamic acid:**  
Immediate infusions of equivalent of 6-8 units of platelets (or one platelet pheresis product),  
2 units of FFP, and 10 units of cryoprecipitate.  
  
**Severe blood loss**  
Administration of packed red blood cells is preferred to whole blood.  
Alternatives include fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate.  
  
**Life-threatening bleed  
**Transfuse more platelets  
Initiate massive transfusion protocols.  
FEIBA 8 to 25 units/kg or Kcentra can be considered.  
  
**_Warning:_** _Thrombotic and thromboembolic events may occur with high doses of PCCs and may result in death. Patients need to be monitored following administration_
