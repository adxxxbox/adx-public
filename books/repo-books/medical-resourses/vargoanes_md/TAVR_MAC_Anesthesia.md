### TAVR MAC Anesthesia

  

_Tara Ruggiero Hardoby, MSN, CRNA_

**Perioperative Labs:**  
Type and screen  
Hb and HCT  
BUN/Cr  
ABG and ACT once arterial line placed

**Anesthetic:** MAC  
Remifentanil infusion: 025mcg/kg/min titrate to effect  
Propofol infusion: 25 mcg/kg/min titrate to effect  
**Note:** These patients are fragile, titrate to effect.  
Our patients are informed that this is a sedation procedure and will be kept comfortable.

**Position:** Supine, arm tucked  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**EBL:** 1-200 ccs

**Access:** Two large bore peripherals, +/- arterial line

**Monitors:**  
Radiolucent defibrillator patches on and to monitor  
ECG (radiolucent)  
ABP (if A-line is utilized)  
NIBP  
O2 Sat  
BIS  
UOP  
ETCO2  
RR  
Radiolucent Defibrillator patches on and to monitor

**A-Line:** Yes.  
Left is preferred. With the Transapical approach, a conduit is sometimes placed in the right subclavian artery, obliterating the distal pulse in the right arm. Start the arterial line prior to induction. I start with low dose Remifentanil (.025 mcg/kg/min) while placing arterial and additional PIV.  
  
Patients are high-risk candidates. Response to induction can be unpredictable. Always have emergency drugs and a defibrillator ready.

**Avoid Hypothermia**

Fluid warmer x1, underbody warmer and metallic hat

**Hydration** < 500 mLs, depending on fluid volume status.  
Albumin bolus can be administered.

**Continuous Infusions:**  
D 5 1/2 NS with 10mEq KCl/L at 75 ml/hr  
Epinephrine: 0.02 mcg/kg/min - titrate as needed  
Norepinephrine: 0.02 mcg/kg/min - titrate as needed  
Nicardipine: start at 5 mg/hr and titrate to effect

Hypertension is likely to occur in the presence of a good EF and LVH.  
Consider starting Nicardipine early.

**Available Cardiac Syringes:**  
Epinephrine 10mcg/mL and 100 mcg/mL  
Vasopressin 1 unit/mL  
NTG 40 mcg/mL  
Phenylephrine 80mcg/mL  
Heparin - GOAL ACT >300  
Ephedrine

**Have available cardiac induction drugs in case of having to convert to GETA:**  
Etomidate or Propofol  
Fentanyl  
Rocuronium  
Succinylcholine  
Induction drugs depend on one's preference.  
Amicar - in case the procedure converted to open with CBP.

**Pacing:**  
Rate is variable dependent on type of valve and access location.  
Pacing rate of 120-180 bpm and last approximately 5-10 seconds.  
The surgeon will usually pace the patient for a test, valvuloplasty and deployment.  
Response to pacing is variable - may require support.  
Patients with preexisting pacers, trans-apical approaches and VIV procedures do not require anesthesia placing a pacing catheter.

**Cental Venous Catheters (CVCs)**  
We are not routinely using CVCs  
One of our patient's biggest complaints post op is neck pain from the central catheter after a MAC case. If necessary, we will place a double lumen CVC in the right IJ.  
Dino spins are a rarity now.  
Confirm pre-procedure of no spin. If they are planning to spin, connect CVC infusions post spin.

**Possible Complications  
**Complete heart block  
Stroke  
MI  
Aortic dissection  
Contrast induced nephropathy  
Perivalvar leaks

**Transapical approach:**  
New onset MR  
Pericardial effusion  
Pneumothorax  
Late apical rupture

**Vascular access site issues**:  
Groin seromas  
Femoral artery dissection  
Thrombosis with lower extremity ischemia  
Retroperitoneal hematoma
