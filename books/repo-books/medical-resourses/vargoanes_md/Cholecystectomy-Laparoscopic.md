**General Review:**

This operation is typically performed for symptomatic gallstones or acute cholecystitis. A laparoscopic approach is preferred to an open cholecystectomy. The operation begins with access to the abdominal cavity at the umbilicus. It is common for a total of four trocars to be used; one in the umbilicus and the other three in the RUQ. The gallbladder is located right below the liver in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen. The body of the gall bladder is attached to the liver and is about 4 inches long. It resembles a pear in shape. The cystic duct and the cystic artery are identified, clipped with tiny titanium clips and then cut. The gallbladder is then dissected away from the liver bed and removed through the umbilical trocar port.

**Indications:**  
Acute Cholecystitis.  
Symptomatic Cholelithiasis.  
Biliary Dyskinesia.  
Gallbladder Trauma.  
History of Liver Transplant.

**Preoperative Considerations:  
**Follow routine preoperative evaluation with additional thorough evaluations of respiratory and cardiac function, especially any cardiac defects with shunting.  
**Premedication:** Is well tolerated (PO or IV Versed) unless patient is actively nauseated; then consider metoclopramide (0.1mg/kg) and ranitidine (0.8mg/kg).  
**Warm the room up:** Regardless of age; consider a lower or under body warming device for peds; an upper body warmer or hot blankets are usually suitable for adults.

**Labs:** Most patients usually have a general chemistry and CBC lab work done from admissions. If not, consider a CBC and other pertinent labs related to the patient’s H&P.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT w/ cuff because of the risk of aspiration.

**Induction:** RSI. Most patients will have an IV; however, if not, let the patient breath down inhalation agent gradually with Nitrous and Inhalation agent. The Recommended agent is sevoflurane for a mask induction; try keeping the patient’s positive pressure ventilations under 15 PSI to avoid abdominal distention and an increased risk of aspiration. Always have suction readily available.

**Nitrous:** Avoid to prevent bowel distention. Sevoflurane and Isoflurane are popular agents for the case.

**Muscle Relaxation** : Initial muscle relaxation is required in order to gain access to the abdomen. Depending on how fast the surgeon is, you may only want to give an initial dose of Succinylcholine for the intubation and just keep the patient deep with, say, Forane, using a low dose Neo drip to maintain their blood pressure. However, most surgeons want no spontaneous breathing, so you may have to increase your minute ventilations to avoid spontaneous ventilations. I will usually give Anectine aka succinylcholine for the intubation, then give either 10 mg of Rocuronium or 1-2 mg of Vecuronium for relaxation. Know your surgeon! Ask the surgical scrub how long the surgeon usually takes. Ask the surgeon directly his best estimate of the operating time. Most surgeons do NOT want either a rapidly breathing patient which causes a loss of abdominal pressure and makes laparoscopy more difficult OR a patient who has been given too much neuromuscular blockade and might have to go on a ventilator in PACU until they can be safely reversed. So, if running into decreased blood pressure and increased spontaneous respirations, consider paralysis.

**Positioning:** The patient will start out supine and when dissection occurs, the surgeon will ask you to place the patient in reverse Trendelenburg position and tilted to the left. Reverse Trendelenburg helps to move the stomach, duodenum, and transverse colon away from operative field. Make sure the patient is properly padded. We use a foot board and thigh straps at our institution to secure the patient to the operating table.

With most institutions going away from shoulder holders and with pediatric patients getting larger, you may want to consider using some form of chest and leg straps or an underbody foam pad in order to hold larger pediatric patient in place.

**IV Access:** Try to obtain one good IV, a 22 gauge or larger. Some patients come in a dehydrated state and have very small peripheral IV access.

**Hydration:** Most patients are already on a maintenance IV therapy (usually D5W with .25 NS and 20 MEQ of K+). However, consider hooking up LR and following 4-2-1 rule for replacement therapy. The procedure usually does not require colloid therapy such as Albumin. However, treat low BP with volume.**  
(below is just a common reference)  
**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg  
  

**Foley:** Use it. The bladder may be emptied for optimal view.

**Duration of case:** 30mins to 2hrs.

**Age Range:** infant to adult  
**EBL:** Minimal; but try to have a CBC available to know range you're starting with.  
**Blood Bolus dose:** 10-20cc/kg if needed.

**Intraoperative Considerations:**

**Pulmonary:** Because CO2 is rapidly absorbed from the peritoneum, PaCO2 increases 25% after abdominal insufflation. If the surgery is greater than 1 hour, hypercapnia can occur, necessitating an increase in minute ventilation anywhere from 50 to 75%. Insufflation pressures range from 6 to 20 mmHg. The greater the intra-abdominal pressures are, the greater the manifestations of cephalad displacement of the diaphragm, decreased excursion of the diaphragm, and decreases in pulmonary compliance (vital capacity, functional residual capacity, and closing volumes) will be. You may then see ventilation/perfusion mismatching, collapsing of small airways leading to atelectasis, and possibly hypoxemia. Position changes can further exacerbate this. You may potentially see endobronchial intubation with such displacement of the diaphragm and increased intra-abdominal pressures. To help avoid such post operative issues, consider positive ventilation, small amount of PEEP, and a cuffed ETT.

**Cardiovascular:** The Intra-abdominal pressure on venous return is directly related to the amount of insufflation pressure being used. It has been found with insufflation pressures greater than 15 mmHg that compression of the IVC, decreased venous return, activation of the vagal reflex causing bradycardia, and decreased CO occur. Studies have shown that intra-abdominal pressures of less than 10 mmHg have elicited minimal CV effects. The internet literature gives ranges from an ideal pressure of 10-12 mmHg. Intravascular embolization of CO2 may also occur, resulting in a decreased BP, dysrhythmias, and sudden cardiovascular collapse.

**Renal:** Pneumoperitoneum markedly decreases intraoperative urine output. It is unclear if this is caused by decreased perfusion from increased intra-abdominal pressures or decreased CO. Because there is no insensible fluid loss and limited manipulation of the bowels, care must be taken to avoid fluid overload, so try to follow the 4-2-1 ratio of replacement. Most oliguria is transient and returns several hours postoperatively.

**Additional Complications:** Bleeding during trocar placement can occur.

**Emergence:** Most surgeons will give local anesthetic around port sites upon closing them. Once the gallbladder is removed, closing of the umbilical and other port sites does not take long, so plan accordingly. Consider suctioning out stomach with OG tube and then removing it while the surgeon is closing the skin. The urinary catheter is usually removed at the end as well. Once the umbilical trocar site is closed, you may start reversing the patient and allow the patient to start spontaneous breathing.  
  

**Consider post operative pain medicine** :  
Morphine (0.5-0.15mg/kg)  
Dilaudid (.02mg/kg), and/or Ketorolac (0.5mg/kg).  
Ofirmev: If the patient is >2 years: 15mg/kg. IV Ofirmev is **Not FDA approved for < 2 years, but many still administer at 15mg/kg dose.**

**Post Operative Considerations:**  
Pain is usually minimal. Pain after laparoscopic surgery arises from several incisional sites, residual gas in the abdomen, referred pain from the diaphragm, and stretch on nerves from any odd positioning. Surgeons usually infiltrate local anesthetic around the incision sites. Other post-operative pain therapies may include acetaminophen, NSAIDS, and opioids. Most children go home a few hours after the surgery; however, it has been shown to be a facility and surgeon dependent choice. Nausea and vomiting are always a risk; consider an antiemetic.
