### Rectal Prolapse Repair

Rectal prolapse occurs when the last several inches of the large intestine (the rectum) becomes abnormally stretched and protrudes from the anus. Rectal prolapse surgery moves the rectum back to its proper place. Rectal prolapse occurs most often in children under age 6 and in the elderly. The main symptom is a reddish-colored mass that sticks out from the opening of the anus, especially following a bowel movement. This reddish mass is actually the inner lining of the rectum. It may bleed slightly and can be uncomfortable and painful.

Abdominal and Rectal (perineal) surgery are the two most common approaches to rectal prolapse repair.

**Abdominal approach:** Could be laparoscopic and/or steep Trendelenberg.

**Abdominal Repair Approaches**  
The two most common types of abdominal repair:  
Rectopexy- (fixation –reattachment of the rectum)  
Resection- colon resection followed by rectopexy.

**Rectal (perineal) repair approaches**  
Often used in older patients and sicker patients.  
Two Common Rectal approaches: Altemeier and Delorme procedures.

**Altemeier procedure** (perineal proctosigmoidectomy) – the portion of the rectum extending out of the anus is cut off and the two ends are sewn back together. The remaining structures that help support the rectum are stitched back together in an attempt to provide better support.

**Delorme procedure**  
In this procedure, only the inner lining of the fallen rectum is removed. The outer layer is then folded and stitched and the cut edges of the inner lining are stitched together so that rectum is now inside of the anal canal.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT; possible LMA for lithotomy position with perineal approach.  
Abdominal approach: General/ETT. Beware, some surgeons may want some Trendelenburg position, which is an increased aspiration risk when using an LMA.  
Other Options: Spinal

**Position:** Supine, lithotomy with candy cane-shaped ankle holders. Sometimes Jack-Knife for perineal  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours IV Access: 20G is acceptable  
**EBL:** 25-50mLs  
  

Always ask the surgeon about limiting IV fluids.  
Difficulty urinating after any anorectal surgery may occur due to spasm of the urinary sphincter resulting from pain due to the surgery. A full bladder can also contribute to rectal pain via pressure. This would **NOT** be good with an overhydrated patient. Many surgeons want you to limit hydration. I have seen some protocols for the patients to have only a 500cc IV bag with micro drip tubing.  

**Risks/Complications:**  
Lack of healing where the two ends of bowel reconnect.  
Intra-abdominal or rectal bleeding.  
Urinary retention.  
Return of rectal prolapse.  
Worsening or development of fecal incontinence.  
Worsening or development of constipation.

**Causes of Rectal Prolapse:**  
Chronic constipation or chronic diarrhea.  
Long-term history of straining during bowel movements.  
Older age: Muscles and ligaments in the rectum and anus naturally weaken with age. Other nearby structures in the pelvis area also loosens with age which adds to the general weakness in that area of the body.  
Weakening of the anal sphincter.  
Prior injury to the anal or pelvic areas.  
Damage to the nerves: If the nerves that control the ability of the rectum and anus muscles to contract are damaged, rectal prolapse can result. Nerve damage can be caused by pregnancy, difficult vaginal childbirth, anal sphincter paralysis, spinal injury, back injury/back surgery, and/or other surgeries of the pelvic area. Other diseases, conditions, and infections.

Rectal prolapse can be a consequence of diabetes, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hysterectomy, and infections in the intestines caused by parasites – such as pinworms and whipworms – and diseases resulting from poor nutrition or from difficulty digesting foods.

Early rectal prolapse can mimic internal hemorrhoids that have slipped out of the anus (ie, prolapsed), making it difficult to tell these two conditions apart.
