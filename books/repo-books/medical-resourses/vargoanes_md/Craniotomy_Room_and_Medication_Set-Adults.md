### Craniotomy Room and Medication/ Doses Set-up-Adults

**_This varies among institutions and surgeons._**

**Anesthesia:**

TIVA is preferred but can be ½ MAC with a Propofol infusion

**Induction:** RSI

\-Arterial line set-up and have it zeroed

\-Ventilator tubing extension (if the surgeon wants to turn the bed 180 degrees)

**IV equipment:**

The patient should have two good-flowing IVs.

\-IV Tubing extension as needed

\-Central line set-up for bleeding and hemodynamically unstable patients

\-Blood warmer and blood infusion tubing primed

\-Consider a manifold with more syringe ports or add extra stopcocks

\-3% Hypertonic saline bag (surgeon request only-rare)

\-Normal Saline IV bags- LR is hypotonic and not recommended here because

 low plasma osmolarity can cause cerebral edema.

**Table Top:**

\-Accordion extension

\-Etomidate or Propofol

\-Two Propofol syringes (one for stimulation from the Mayfield pin placement)

\-A cardene and pressor syringe (Norepinephrine or Neosynephrine)

\-Fentanyl syringe

\-Muscle Relaxants (Norcuron or Rocuronium)

\-Esmolol available for induction

\-ETT #7 and 8 with stylet

\-Esophageal temp probe

\-Glide Scope should be available.

\-Tegaderm for covering the eyes

**Antibiotics:**

2 grams of Ancef

1 gram of Vancomycin

**3% Hypertonic Saline Bag:**

Some surgeons request it as it is considered superior to mannitol in

achieving optimal brain relaxation, maintaining stable blood flow, and minimizing diuretic effects.

**MOA of hypertonic saline:**

It decreases the interstitial fluid content of the brain, which has an intact blood-brain barrier. This pulls water across the cerebral capillary endothelium down its osmotic gradient.

However, it can increase the volume of the brain with impaired blood-brain barrier function.

**Optimal dose:** 5 ml/kg body weight.

**Warning:** Hypertonic saline during tumor craniotomy procedures can increase plasma sodium levels.

Assess the patient’s sodium levels prior to administration.

**Narcotic continuous infusion:** Remifentanil is often used as an adjunct with Propofol in non-urgent cases.

**Remifentanil:** .02-.25 mcg/kg/min as an adjunct to Propofol infusion.

**IV Pumps:**

Propofol infusion for TIVA (have large extra propofol bottles)

**Medications:**

**BP meds:**

Neosynephrine and Nicardipine (Cardene) primed.

Norepinephrine may be used instead of Neosynephrine

**Cardene:** 5-15 mg/hour

**Note:** Nitroglycerine has been replaced by Cardene by most anesthesia providers

A diluted Cardene syringe for BP spikes

Neosynephrine and Ephedrine Syringe

**Anticonvulsant:**

Keppra (Levetiracetam) 1 gram over 1-2 minutes

**Note:** Keppra has replaced Dilantin

Always check the MAR to see if an anticonvulsant was already administered- especially for urgent procedures.

**Brain Protection Meds:**

**Lasix**\-have available

**Decadron** –the patient is usually already on steroids.

**Mannitol:** 25% (bags or bottles) available

**Mannitol dose:** 1 gram/kg before incision

**25% Bottles:** 12-25 grams IV push or

**20% Bags:** 0.2 g/mL and can hang to gravity

**Dilantin is rarely used now.** It is given at 20mg/min via pump (1 gram/hr).

If you push it too fast, it can cause a decrease in BP and seizures.
