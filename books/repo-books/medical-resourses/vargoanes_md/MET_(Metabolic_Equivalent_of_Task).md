### MET (Metabolic Equivalent of Task)

MET coincides with functional capacity.  
**1 MET =** Consumption of 3.5mL O2/min/kg  
  
**Functional Capacity:** Functional capacity uses a patient's exercise capacity is a reliable predictor of future cardiac events.  
  
**METs (Functional Capacity) can provide:** An estimated cardiac risk for surgery.  
Determine if a patient needs a cardiac workup.  
Determine if interventions are warranted to reduce perioperative cardiac risk.  
  
In general, procedures that are longer and have greater potential for blood loss, hemodynamic instability, and intravascular fluid shifts carry greater cardiac risk for patients with lower METs.  
The lower the METs, the higher the perioperative cardiac risk.  
  
**Example:**  
\> 7 METs of activity tolerance is considered excellent.< 4 METs is considered poor activity tolerance.  
_< 4 METs, consider a cardiac consult._  
  
**How to lower the perioperative cardiac risk:**  
**Goal:** We want to prevent tachycardia and maintain a baseline BP.  
  
**Selective beta1 antagonists:** Metoprolol  
Neosynephrine or ephedrine (or any other pressor) to prevent prolonged hypotension outside of 20% of the patient’s baseline BP.   
  
**Statins:**  Some literature states a 60% to 70% reduction in mortality with patients currently on statins. However, we rarely start a patient on statins for surgery.   
  
**Poor (<4 METs)  
**Unable to walk > 2 blocks on level ground without stopping due to symptoms of dyspnea, exhaustion.  
Patients limited in their activity from noncardiac causes, such as severe osteoarthritis or general debility, are categorized as having poor functional capacity.  
These patients may benefit from a cardiac workup.  
  
**4-7 METs  
**Ability to Walk on level ground at about 4 miles per hour or carrying a bag of groceries up a flight of stairs.Climbing a flight of stairs.  
Fast walking.  
Bicycling  
These patients generally not require extensive cardiac workup.  
  
**7 METs  
**Climbing  \>  1 flight of stairs without stopping.  
Walking up hill > 1-2 blocks.  
Able to Golf, bowl, dance or play tennis.  
Capable of Running a short distance.  
  
**10 METs:** Patient can Participate in strenuous sports like swimming, single tennis, football, baseball.  
  
Intraoperatively, when your patient’s HR suddenly jumps to 130 bpm, you will be less alarmed if your patient has a high METs versus a lower METs.   
A HR of 130 bpm is probably a common HR for the high METs patient during exercise and is nothing new to them.  
  
**More Notes:**  
One MET is defined as the oxygen consumption of a 70-kg man at rest.   
A person functioning at 1 MET is limited to simple activities such as eating, dressing, and using the toilet.  
A patient with a high METs is physically in shape. The higher the METs, the less we have to worry about during surgery.  
  
1 MET is considered equivalent to the consumption of 3.5 ml O 2 ·kg −1 ·min −1 (or 3.5 ml of oxygen per kilogram of body mass per minute) and is roughly equivalent to the expenditure of 1 kcal per kilogram of body weight per hour.  
  
MET can be thought of as an index of the intensity of activities: for example, an activity with a MET value of 2, such as walking at a slow pace would require twice the energy that an average person consumes at rest (e.g., sitting quietly).  
  
3 METs ( **metabolic equivalent of task)**  represents an exercise intensity equivalent to 3 times the metabolic rate at rest.  
MET is actually an index number and not an energy unit.  
Statin studies have revealed a 60% to 70% reduction in mortality for patients at risk for postoperative MI and cardiac events.  
  
MET values of activities range from 0.9 ml O2/kg/min (sleeping) to 23 (running at a 4:17 mile pace).
