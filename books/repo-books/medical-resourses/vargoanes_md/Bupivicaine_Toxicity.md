### Bupivicaine Toxicity

**Bupivicaine central nervous system (CNS) Toxicity  
  
Biggest disadvantage:**  Severe cardiotoxicity which may occur with high plasma levels causing a refractory cardiac arrest. Associated with the most severe local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) following inadvertent intravascular injection.  
  
**Cardiotoxicity**  
Bupivacaine has a high degree of protein binding and lipid solubility which allow it to accumulate in the cardiac conduction system. This results in the onset of refractory reentrant arrhythmias and Torsades de Pointes (polymorphic ventricular tachycardia).  
  
Bupivacaine, is four times more potent than lidocaine in blocking nerves and depressing cardiac contractility.  
  
**Hazardous plasma concentrations**  
4 mcg/ml plasma level of bupivacaine will result in seizures  
4-6 mcg/ml is associated with cardiotoxicity.  
The plasma level of lidocaine associated with cardiotoxicity is 20-25 mcg/ml.  
  
Bupivacaine binds more strongly to resting/inactivated Na channels as compared to other local anesthetics; and 2) dissociates from Na channels more slowly than lidocaine during diastole.  
  
**Bupivacaine vs ropivacaine  
**Cardiotoxicity of ropivacaine is MUCH less than bupivacaine.  
Ropivacaine “S” isomers do NOT strongly attach to cardiac Na channels.  
Bupivacaine “R” isomer can bind strongly to the cardiac Na channels which increases the possibility of cardiac toxicity from an accidental intravascular injection.  
  
**Example**  
With ropivacaine, a 20 mg dose in a laboring patient is less than 0.33 mg/kg.  
This is safe and effective dose.  
If 20 mg of Ropivacaine were administered accidentally IV, it would be much safer than bupivacaine, and, depending on the rate of injection, may NOT cause any cardiac symptoms.  
  
**Bupivacaine is much safer with lower concentrations**  
Bupivacaine remains in extensive use. It is safe, especially at lower concentrations (0.125%).  
  
Cardiovascular toxicity mediated at the heart:  
  
Although all local anesthetics block the cardiac conduction system via dose-dependent block of sodium channels, two features of bupivacaine’s sodium channel blocking abilities may enhance its cardiotoxicity.  
  
First, bupivacaine exhibits a much stronger binding affinity to resting and inactivated sodium channels than lidocaine.  
  
Second, local anesthetics bind to sodium channels during systole and dissociate during diastole.  
  
Furthermore, bupivacaine inhibits calcium channels, release of calcium from sarcoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondrial energy metabolism; thus multiple direct effects of bupivacaine on activity of the cardiac myocyte may enhance the cardiotoxicity of bupivacaine. The multitude of different cardiac and neural mechanisms of cardiotoxicity may in part explain the reported difficulties of resuscitation after cardiovascular collapse from bupivacaine.
