### Esophagectomy- Minimally Invasive

An Esophagectomy is surgery to remove part or the entire esophagus.   
**Indications:** Esophageal CA or Barrett’s Esophagitis.  
  
**Procedure**  
Two Incisions are made into the abdominal and right chest. The proximal part of the stomach and esophagus is dissected free from the surrounding tissue. The diseased part of the esophagus is removed. The stomach is stapled in a way to create a tubular shape.  
The stomach is pulled up through the chest so it can be anastomosed to remaining esophagus. This new connection is an Esophagogastric Anastomosis. Lymph nodes in the neck and chest may also be removed and staged. Incisions are closed and a gastric or duodenal feeding tube is inserted.  
   
**Anesthetic: General with a DLT.  
Bronchoscopy Cart:** Yes, to verify DLT placement.  
Thoracic Epidural: T7-T8 level unless contraindicated.  
**Induction:** RSI, many have a poorly functional Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES) and may be markedly prone to aspiration.  
**IV Access:** 2 large bore IVs.  
Central line for a CVP is optional (not as common as before).  
**A-Line:** Yes  
**EBL:** Depends on surgeon; usually around 300-500mLs.  
**Duration:** 3-8 hours, depending on the surgeon.  
**Position:** This case will probably start out supine, then go to either left lateral or prone, then back to supine. It starts out in the supine position so that an esophagogastroscopy can be performed to assess precise location and extension of the diseased area.  
**Type and Cross**: Yes.  
**Extubation:** Sometimes we prefer to wait until the patient is in the ICU while others may  extubate ASAP. Remember there are fluid shifts etc. The goal is to extubate within hours.

**Quick note:** Many surgeons try to spare the vagus nerve branches to preserve gastric acid production and digestive functions.
