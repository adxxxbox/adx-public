Myasthenic Gravis and Anesthesia    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Myasthenic Gravis and Anesthesia

The patient should have surgical clearance from their neurologist and recommended pre-op and post-op administration of pyridostigmine.  
Holding pyridostigmine is controversial.  
  
**Pre-op assessment, what to assess:**  
The severity and grade of the MG.  
History of exacerbations, intubations and ICU admissions.  
**Associated disorders:** Underactive or overactive thyroid, autoimmune conditions -rheumatoid arthritis or lupus and pernicious anemia.  
Cough strength and bulbar muscles.  
  
Inform the patient of the possibility of requiring postoperative mechanical ventilation.  
  
**Classifications of MG:**  
Grade I – only eyes affected.  
Grade IIa – mild generalized MG that is responding well to therapy.  
Grade IIb – moderate generalized MG that is responding less well to therapies.  
Grade III – severe generalized disease.  
Grade IV – myasthenic crisis requiring mechanical ventilation.  
  
**Assess the possibility of post-operative ventilation.  
_Associated factors requiring prolonged post-op ventilation:  
_**Preoperative bulbar symptoms  
FVC < 40mL/kg  
Vital capacity <2 to 2.9 L  
History of MG > 6 years  
Major surgery  
Intraoperative blood loss >1000 mL   
COPD  
Grades III and IV MG   
Daily dosing of 750 mg or more of Pyridostigmine to manage the disease process.  
Serum anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody >100 nmol/mL  
  
**Note:** Early in the course of MG, patients may be absent of symptoms when awakening.  
**Preoperative anesthesia concerns  
**Preoperative muscle strength. Is it optimal?  
Anticholinesterase medications, schedule and the possibility of a low level of plasma cholinesterase.  
Plasmapheresis may also delay the metabolism of NDMRs.  
**Note:** A very low level of plasma cholinesterase level can contribute to a prolonged block; even a phase II block.  
  
**Intraoperative and postoperative anesthesia concerns  
**Inspiratory muscle weakness due to the residual paralysis from NDMRs postponing extubation.  
The possibility of requiring postoperative ventilation due to inspiratory and bulbar muscle weakness.  
Postoperative myasthenic crises or cholinergic crises.  
Consider avoiding documented triggers that may worsen MG or possibly cause a myasthenic crises.  
  
**Documented triggers of myasthenic crises**  
Stress  
Surgery  
Respiratory infection  
Other current illnesses  
Pregnancy and childbirth  
Certain medications  
Tapering of immunosuppressive medications  
Insufficient anticholinesterase medication

| High-Risk ABs | Low-Risk ABs | Cardiovascular | Other |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

|   | Nitrofurantoin | Lidocaine | Thyroid replacement |

  
  
**Drugs that may interfere with neuromuscular transmission:  
**Inhaled anesthetics  
Antibiotics  
Local anesthetics  
Anticonvulsants  
Beta-blockers  
  
**Medication concerns  
Increased sensitivity of muscle relaxants  
**The duration of succinylcholine and NDMR are widely variable with MG patients and monitoring TO4 is of upmost importance.  
The orbicularis oculi muscle may overestimate the degree of muscle relaxation, but is still the site desired by many anesthesia providers for monitoring TOF to avoid the possibility of undetected residual muscle relaxation.  
**_Note:_** _Nimbex (cisatracurium) is the NDMR of choice because the ester hydrolysis for metabolism is independent of_ plasma _cholinesterase_ .  
  
However, the administration of an anticholinesterase and antimuscarinic for the reversal has disadvantages.  
Sugammadex is preferred.  
  
**Muscle relaxants may be prolonged:  
**ED 50 and ED 95 of muscle relaxants with MG may be 2.0 and 2.6 times normal.Anticholinesterase inhibitors (Pyridostigmine) block the effects of plasma cholinesterase, as well as true cholinesterase, and cause a delayed hydrolysis in anesthesia related drugs (succinylcholine) that rely on plasma cholinesterase for metabolism.  
  
**This may cause a prolonged duration of the following anesthesia related drugs:**  
Ester local anesthetics (benzocaine, chloroprocaine, tetracaine, and procaine)  
_Because there are functionally fewer nicotinic receptors with MG patients, they are less susceptible to succinylcholine and more susceptible to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants._  
Succinylcholine is safe to administer and the patient may some resistance to it.  
Nondepolarizing muscle relaxants (NDMR), only 1/10 th the normal dose may cause adequate muscle relaxation.  
Most anesthesia providers can now titrate rocuronium or vecuronium to effect and fully reverse with sugammadex when needed.  
This does not apply to Atracurium or Cisatracurium because they are rapidly eliminated via Hoffman elimination.  
  
Chronic steroid therapy can also produce resistance to NDMRs.**  
  
Pre-op  
**Patients should be admitted 24-48 hours before surgery to allow detailed assessment of respiratory muscle and bulbar function, and thorough review of their anticholinesterase and corticosteroid therapy.  
Respiratory reserve is best monitored by serial forced vital capacity (FVC) measurements.  
  
**Morning dose of anticholinesterase:** It is suggested to continue anticholinesterase agents (ie, pyridostigmine or neostigmine) up to and including the morning of surgery, knowing the response to both succinylcholine and NDMRs will be altered.  
It is documented that withholding the morning dose of anticholinesterase agent resulted in some patient s complaints of respiratory discomfort while waiting for surgery and some required a rescue dose of neostigmine IV preoperatively.**Administration of stress-dose glucocorticoid is controversial:** Patients whose treatment for MG includes glucocorticoids may be at risk for hypothalamic pituitary axis (HPA) suppression and adrenal insufficiency in the perioperative period.  
However, glucocorticoids (especially high doses) is a well-known trigger to myasthenic crises.  
  
**Patients NOT at risk for HPA suppression and, therefore, should NOT receive stress dose glucocorticoids**  
Patients who have taken glucocorticoids of any dose for < 3 weeks or  
Daily prednisone < 5 mg or its equivalent for any duration or  
Taking < 10 mg prednisone or its equivalent every other day in the six months prior to surgery  
  
**Labs:** BMP, abnormal electrolytes can augment NDMRs.  
PFTs and ABGs, CXR to rule out pneumonia.  
  
**Limit medications**  
Minimize and administer short-acting sedatives, narcotics, hypnotics, and anesthetic agents to minimize respiratory depression on emergence from anesthesia.  
  
**Regional anesthesia is preferred over general.  
Note:** Amide local anesthetics (bupivacaine, lidocaine ropivacaine, mepivacaine) should be chosen over esters for patients who take anticholinesterases.  
**Warnings:**  Mid-thoracic or higher levels of neuraxial anesthesia can result in paralysis of accessory muscles of breathing.  
Supraclavicular and interscalene brachial plexus blocks may paralyze the diaphragm by blocking the phrenic nerve, potentially for many hours, which may not be tolerated by MG patients with respiratory compromise.  
**  
TIVA is preferred for general anesthesia.  
**TIVA may provide sufficient relaxation for tracheal intubation as well as most surgical procedures.**Monitoring:** ASA  
Consider arterial line for thymectomy procedures and high risk patients.  
**  
Induction:  
**Succinylcholine is safe to use as mentioned above.  
Consider avoiding lidocaine, it is a documented trigger.  
It is still commonly administered.  
Vecuronium and rocuronium are still considered safe with vigilant dosing.  
Avoid acid-base abnormalities  
  
**Maintain normothermia:** Excessive heat or cold can worsen MG  
  
**Reversal of muscle relaxation  
**Use sugammadex INSTEAD of neostigmine and glycopyrrolate.  
The presence of anticholinesterases and antimuscarinics could make it difficult to differentiate weakness due to inadequate neuromuscular transmission from a true cholinergic crisis in the recovery room.  
Head of bed up to augment ventilation.  
With MG patients, do not automatically assume that weakness during emergence means there is still some residual blockade from the muscle relaxant.  
  
**Extubation:** Awake extubation  
Do not extubate unless awake, alert and able to lift their head off the pillow for 5 seconds.  
  
**Common extubation criteria for MG patients**  
\> 5 second sustained head lift  
5 second sustained tetanus at 50 Hz (do not check with an awake patient)  
CNS: Awake and alert  
**Respiratory:** NIF < 30 cmH20 (meaning more negative)  
FVC > 1,000 mLs  
Adequate oxygenation with < .4 FIO2  
Adequate ventilation with PaCO2 < 55 mmHg  
Resp rate: < 25 breaths per minute (adult)  
**Cardiac:** Adequate BP and absence of new arrhythmias  
**Metabolic:** Normothermia, normal glucose and electrolytes  
**Hematologic:** Adequate hemostasis  
  
**When in doubt of extubation:** You could postpone extubation and transport the patient to recovery room via flow-by T-tube for further observation.  
  
**Post-op  
**Restart anticholinergic as per neurologist recommendation.  
The dose of pyridostigmine is based on the preoperative dose.  
**Note:** 2 mg of IV neostigmine is equivalent to 60 mg of PO pyridostigmine.  
  
Avoid triggers of myasthenic crises.**  
  
Postoperative concerns  
**Respiratory weakness and failure  
Myasthenic crises  
Cholinergic crises (more rare)  
Post thymectomy procedure: Pneumothorax and phrenic nerve damage  
  
Patient should admitted to ICU for postoperative monitoring.  
  
**Myasthenic crises and Cholinergic crises  
**Both myasthenic and cholinergic crises result in muscle weakness and may require intubation and mechanical ventilation.  
**Myasthenic crises:** A life-threatening acute exacerbation of someone with MG that is severe enough to require intubation and mechanical ventilation.  
It may also include post-surgical patients, in whom exacerbation of muscle weakness from MG causes a delay in extubation.  
May result from tapering or an insufficient amount of MG medication (anticholinesterase drug) or from a trigger (stress, surgery, respiratory infection or other illness) that has created an acute exacerbation of MG.**  
  
Symptoms of myasthenic crisis  
**Muscle weakness, can involve bulbar and respiratory muscles requiring intubation.  
Increased HR, BP and RR  
Dilated pupils (mydriasis)  
Bowel and bladder incontinence  
Decreased urine output  
Weak cough and dysphagia  
May temporarily improve with Tensilon (pyridostigmine)-Tensilon test**Cholinergic crises:** More rare and may result from overmedication of the anticholinesterase medication for MG,  
resulting in an excess of ACh at nicotinic and muscarinic receptor sites.  
  
**Symptoms of a cholinergic crises  
**Muscle weakness and may progress to respiratory failure  
Increased secretions and may progress to airway obstruction and aspiration  
Fasciculations  
Nausea, vomiting  
Abdominal cramps  
Blurred vision  
Constriction of pupils (miosis)  
Pallor  
Facial muscle twitching  
Diarrhea  
Lacrimation  
Bradycardia  
Hypotension  
  
Tensilon has no effect.  
Symptoms improve with administration of anticholinergic (atropine).
