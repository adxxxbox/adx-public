**Background:  
**Trauma is the sixth leading cause of death in all age groups and the first leading cause of death in individuals under age 35 worldwide. Hemorrhage during the first few hours of trauma accounts for 80% of all deaths in trauma patients. Currently, blood transfusions remain the sole treatment modality in bleeding trauma patients and during emergency surgeries. Although the safety of blood transfusions has been established with screening of donated blood for infections such as HIV, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C, blood transfusion is still an independent risk factor for adverse patient outcomes. The estimated cost of one unit of packed red blood cells is between $700-$1200 U.S. dollars when all the activities involved in blood transfusion are taken into account. Tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic drug, prevents blood clots from breaking down and reduces blood loss by inhibiting plasminogen activation and plasmin activity. Tranexamic acid binds ten times more strongly than Amicar® (Aminocaproic acid), an older antifibrinolytic drug, at the receptor sites of plasminogen molecule and is proven to be more effective than Amicar®.

**Results:**  
Tranexamic acid significantly reduces mortality and blood transfusion requirements in adult trauma patients. Tranexamic acid does not increase the risk of thromboembolic complications in trauma patients. Tranexamic acid is a cost-effective solution to saving lives in hemorrhaging trauma patients in low, middle, and high income countries. The widespread use of Tranexamic acid is predicted to save 70,000 to 100,000 lives per year around the world. Due to the benefits of Tranexamic acid in reducing mortality in trauma patients, the drug has been included in World Health Organization’s list of essential medicines.

**Clinical Recommendations:**  
Administer a loading dose of 1 g of IV Tranexamic acid over 10 minutes, followed by a 1 g IV infusion over 8 hours in hemorrhaging adult trauma patients presenting for surgery. Administer Tranexamic acid as early as possible to surgical trauma patients, preferably within three hours of injury.
