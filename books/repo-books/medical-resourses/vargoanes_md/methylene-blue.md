# Methylene Blue

**Methylene Blue**  
(3,7-bis (dimethylamino)-phenothiazin-5-ium chloride trihydrate)  
In anesthesia, we administer it as a blue dye during some GU procedures as a surgical marker.  
(similar purpose as Indigo Carmine).  
It appears in the urine within 10 minutes.  
During a cystoscopy, when the dye can be observed draining from both ureters into the bladder, it confirms patent and functional ureters.  
(similar purpose as Indigo Carmine).  
**Indigo Carmine** appears to be replacing Methylene Blue  
  
**Doses: 0.25 - 1.00 mg/kg**  
**For GU:** 50-100mg (5 or 10mL vial)  
  
**Peds:** Same as adult dose.  
**Cardiac Dose** (very rare)  
For refractory vasoplegia: 2mg/kg IV bolus  
OR  
2 mg/kg in 100 cc NS and give over 30 minutes  
**SaO2 Drop with Methylene Blue**  
It will immediately and transiently drop the SaO2. So don't panic. It comes right back up.  
**Documented Other Indications :**  
Methomoglobinemia  
Ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy  
Cyanide poisoning  
Refractory Vasoplegic Syndrome - after CPB  
**Warning:** Hypertension and dysrhythmias are reported with rapid administration.  
Reduced doses are used in renal failure.  
**Method of Action:**  
It inhibits guanylate cyclase - believed to cause the vasodilation. It is not a vasoconstrictor.  
In detail - it blocks the GMPc system it releases the AMPc system, facilitating the norepinephrine vasoconstrictor effect.  
It can potentially counteract the effects of inflammatory mediators on vascular smooth muscle in a variety of physiologic states.  
Methylene Blue produces two opposite actions on hemoglobin.  
**Low doses:** Will convert methemoglobin to hemoglobin.  
**High doses:** Converts hemoglobin to methemoglobin.  
**Caution:** Should not be given to patients taking serotonergic drugs. It inhibits the action of monoamine oxidase A - an enzyme responsible for breaking down serotonin in the brain.  
It is believed that when patients taking serotonergic psychiatric medications, high levels of serotonin can build up in the brain causing Serotonin Syndrome.  
**Adverse Effects:** HTN and bladder irritation.  
**Other Non Anesthesia Notes**  
**Methemoglobinemia**  
When hemoglobin loses an electron and becomes oxidized, it is converted to the ferric state (Fe3+) or methemoglobin. It now lacks the electron that is needed to form a bond with oxygen (decreased affinity) increasing the affinity to the other heme sites lowering over all oxygen delivery.  
Normal methemoglobin levels are 1%.  
Methemoglobin levels > 20% should be treated.
