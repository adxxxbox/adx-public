## Laryngospasm - Methods of Prevention and Treatments

**Cease Stimulation  
100% oxygen  
Deepen the anesthesia - propofol**  

**Simultaneous Mask CPAP (tight seal) and jaw thrust.  
**CPAP or IPPV with a closed glottis may cause gastric distension - consider inserting a OGT or suction the stomach after the laryngospasm is resolved.  
Apply only 15-20 cmH20 CPAP because esophageal opening pressure is 20-25 cmH20.  

**Jaw Thrust** \- anterior and upward displacement longitudinally separates the base of the tongue, epiglottis and the aryepiglottic folds from the vocal cords helping relieve laryngospasm.  
**Deepen the anesthesia with an IV agent (propofol is popular)  
Visualize and clear the pharynx/airway  
**(If you suspect aspiration, also initiate aspiration algorithm)  
  
**Request immediate assistance  
Intubate and ventilate -** if unsuccessful in breaking the laryngospasm  

**More Notes and Drug Doses  
****Small dose of Succinylcholine (without reintubating)  
**0.1 - 2mg/kg of succinylcholine IV or alternative route.  
0.01 mg/kg of Atropine if bradycardia also occurred (Peds).  
A low dose of succinylcholine is well documented to break a laryngospasm.  
The small dose of 0.1 mg/kg has been reported to break laryngospasm but preserve spontaneous ventilation during adult bronchoscopy cases.

**½cc (10mg) of succinylcholine is popular**  

Succinylcholine is the drug of choice if propofol fails to relieve laryngospasm, although many may prefer to use succinylcholine as first line.

**Small dose of Propofol**  
I.V. propofol (increments of 0.5 mg/kg increments) is the drug of choice.  
Propofol has been reported to relieve laryngospasm in just more than 75% of cases.  
It is always useful to have some pre-prepared syringes of propofol on standby in addition to atropine and succinylcholine.

**Magnesium is a documented treatment**  
15mg/kg of Magnesium is documented as another treatment to reduce the frequency of laryngospasm after awake extubation in a small, but well-designed, study of pediatric adenotonsillectomy patients. It is still not the standard of care.

**Large dose of Lidocaine**  
1.5-2mg/kg IV of lidocaine have been noted to prevent laryngospasm prior to extubation. It may prolong emergence. Topical lidocaine spray applied to the larynx before intubation is used often when manipulating the larynx and has been studied as an aid to prevent laryngospasm. One study showed a slight decrease in the incidence of laryngospasm.

**Robinul may lower the risk**  
Robinul is thought to reduce the risk of laryngospasm by its antisialogue action, reducing the amount of pharyngeal secretions. Its use to prevent laryngospasm is unproven.

**Succinylcholine for laryngospasm with NO IV access**  
Succinylcholine can be given by IM, intralingual or the intraosseous route.  

**IM Dose:** 4 mg kg (suggested maximum dose 200 mg).

After IM injection, it only takes 45-60 seconds to break the laryngospasm.  
Full paralysis takes 3-4 minutes.  
Studies have shown that relaxation of the laryngeal muscles occurs before skeletal muscles.  
Deltoid or the lateral quadriceps are both popular injection sites.  
If the administration is given late when perfusion through the skeletal muscles is poor, the uptake will be variable.

**Jaw Thrust and Larson Maneuver**  
Dislocation of the temporomandibular joint anteriorly by application of pressure to the ascending rami of the mandible lengthens the thyrohyoid muscle and unfolds the soft supraglottic tissue.

**Larson's Maneuver (pressure on laryngospasm notch)**  
Larson's Maneuver is bilateral firm digital pressure on the styloid process behind the posterior ramus of the mandible.  
It is basically a simultaneous vigorous jaw thrust with pressure between the posterior ramus of the mandible and anterior to the mastoid process.  
This maneuver is reported to break laryngospasm, but has not been fully subjected to study.

One article states that the author feels the Larson Maneuver only works in the semiconscious patient with supraglottic obstruction that is unrelieved by simple airway support measures, because intense stimulation induces an increase in the tone of many muscle groups, including those that support the airway. Applying significant pressure posterior to the angle of the mandible achieves the twin purpose of jaw thrust (provided the jaw is unlocked) and a pain-induced change in the level of anesthesia. It is likely that the painful stimulus relaxes the vocal folds and vocal cords by way of either the parasympathetic or sympathetic nervous systems.  

**Below are some documented methods, but not the standard of care.**

**Intralingual Succinylcholine (not sublingual)**  
(IM injection into the body of the tongue)  
Intralingual succinylcholine of 2 mg kg has been documented in children but is not a standard practice. Full relaxation occurs in 75 seconds. IM being 45 seconds is quicker.  
Intralingual succinylcholine has been associated with arrhythmias.

**Intraosseous Succinylcholine (I.O.)  
**I.O. succinylcholine of 1mg/kg has been verified in animal studies with the onset of 35 seconds. Unfortunately there is the delay time to insert the I.O cannula.  

**Superior laryngeal nerve block  
**Superior laryngeal nerve block have been described to successfully treat recurrent laryngospasm in a small case series.

**Doxopram or nitroglycerin infusions**  
Doxopram or nitroglycerin infusions have each been reported as case reports to treat laryngospasm.

**Gentle chest compressions  
**One study showed that gentle chest compressions have successfully relieved a laryngospasm 74% of the time.  
Gentle chest compressions at a rate of 20-25 per minutes combined with 100% CPAP. It was suggested that the intra-thoracic helped open the glottis or also by stimulation of the vagal Hering-Breuer deflation reflex, which may inhibit reflex glottic closure.

If all fails, many times the hypoxia alone will relieve the laryngospasm by relaxing the vocal cords.
