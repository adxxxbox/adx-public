### Achilles Tendon Repair

The Achilles tendon is the strongest and thickest tendon in the body, connecting the gastrocnemius, soleus and plantaris to the calcaneus. It is the most commonly injured tendon. Rupture usually occurs during recreational sports while pushing off or jumping. This rupture occurs mostly with men. There is poor blood supply to the distal part of the tendon.  
There are two different types of repair; open surgery and percutaneous surgery. Either way, the surgeon simply sews it back together.  
Sometimes the surgeon uses a tissue graft (tendon) as a bridge to reconnect the gastrocnemius to the calcaneus.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT-most common. A MAC with popliteal fossa block for intra and post op pain is rare due to patient position.  
A Spinal, Epidural or Femoral/Sciatic block is also rare.  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**Position:** Prone  
**Tourniquet:** Yes  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 20g is acceptable  
**Antibiotics:** Usually Ancef

**Complications:**  
Sural Nerve damages  
  
**Other Notes**  
Fluoroquinolone antibiotics (Cipro and Levaquin) have been associated with Achilles tendinitis and tendon ruptures. 

The average age of these patients is 29–40 years, with a male-to-female ratio of nearly 20:1.
