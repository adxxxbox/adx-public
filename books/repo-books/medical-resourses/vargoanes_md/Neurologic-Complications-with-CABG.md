### Neurologic Complications of CABG

Neurologic deficits are usually transient.  
Incidence of stroke is around 5%.  
  
**Emboli of some sort is the usual cause:**  
Air emboli  
Fat emboli  
Thrombus  
Calcified debris  
CPB circuit debris  
  
Manipulation of an ascending aorta containing plaqye during cannulation or when applying the cross clamp is the biggest contributor of cerebral emboli.  
  
CT scans, MRI or an epi-aortic scanning device can help the surgeon to best determine the safest location to apply the cross clamp.  
  
Hyperglycemia can exacerbate ischemic brain injury.  
  
Pericardial shed blood can be highly thrombogenic.  
  
Errors in use of the pump oxygenator may allow air to enter the arterial cannula, causing air embolism to CNS (or coronary circulation).  
  
Proper venting of the aortic root is done to remove any gaseous emboli from the heart.  
  
Before removal of the cross clamp, some literature advises positioning of the operating table into trendelenburg. (This is usually not done).  
  
TEE by the anesthesiologist can assess whether there is any air remaining in the heart.  
  
The incidence of postoperative delirium after CABG is <10%, similar to that reported after non-cardiac surgery. The risks include advanced age, preexisting cognitive impairment, and vascular disease.  
Intraoperative cerebral microembolization does not predict the presence or severity of postoperative delirium. For patients who do experience postoperative cognitive dysfunction, the changes are generally mild and usually resolve within 3 months of surgery.
