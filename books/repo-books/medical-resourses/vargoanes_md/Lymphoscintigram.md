### Lymphoscintigram

This little procedure is usually done with a Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) Biopsy. It basically makes it much easier for the surgeon to locate a Sentinel Lymph Node for a biopsy.  

A small amount of radioactive tracer is administered by injection into the region of interest as it’s picked up and traced to the lymph nodes. Low levels of radiation will be emitted and detected by a gamma probe.  
  
SLN biopsy involves injecting a tracer material (Radio nucleotide if generic or Technetium 99) and blue dye, or both sub-dermally in the peri-areolar region of the affected breast. Blue dye is for visual confirmation of location.  
It takes about 7-10 minutes to travel from injection site via afferent lymph vessels to the SLN. The surgeon will then make the axillary injection and pin point the SLN with a gamma probe (kind of like a Geiger Counter). When the machine gets really loud, the surgeon knows he/she is at the SLN. The SLN is then removed and sent to pathology. If the pathology results are negative, the cancer isn't likely to have spread and removing additional lymph nodes is unnecessary.  
  
The room will be scanned with a Geiger Counter after the procedure, before the room is  
set up for the next case.

**Skin**: Transient or long-term blue coloration. Don’t be surprised when you see how your patient’s skin tone becomes blue-tinged by the time of emergence from the injected dye.

**Lymphadenectomy and Lymphoscintigraphy  
Background:** It is believed that breast tumor cells will migrate from a primary tumor and may metastasize to one or a few nearby sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), before involving the larger downstream axillary lymph nodes (ALNs). So by locating these nearby SLNs and getting biopsies, the surgeon can determine the need for axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in breast cancer patients.  
A negative SLN biopsy is good news and prevents the need for an ALND. We all know that an ALND is more invasive and increases the risk of arm lymphedema.  
  
Any patient that has had an ALND, we usually avoid IVs and BP cuffs to that arm because of a risk of lymphedema. Some surgeons will debate this.
