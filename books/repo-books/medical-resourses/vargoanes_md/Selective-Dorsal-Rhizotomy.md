Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR)   

### Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR)

  
_By Dina Velocci CRNA_

This procedure is not preformed commonly due to the improvement of CP medications and the popularity of the intrathecal Baclofen pump.SDR is a simple lumbar procedure where a selective cutting of posterior nerve roots to reduce spasticity and improve function in children with spastic cerebral palsy.

SDR begins with a small incision along the lumbar region. The spinous processes and a portion of the lamina are removed to expose the spinal cord and spinal nerves. The neurosurgeon divides each of the dorsal roots into 3-5 rootlets and stimulates each rootlet electrically while the patient is being monitored. Rootlets are ranked from 1 (mild) to 4 (severe) for spasticity. The severely abnormal rootlets are cut. This technique is repeated for rootlets between spinal nerves L1 and S1/S2.

This reduces messages from the muscle, resulting in a better balance of activities of nerve cells in the spinal cord, and thus reduces spasticity. When testing and cutting are complete, the dura mater is closed, and fentanyl or morphine is given to bathe the sensory nerves directly (intrathecal). The other layers of tissue, muscle, fascia and subcutaneous tissue are sewn.

**The Preoperative Evaluation (From CP Anesthesia)**  
**Pre-op Assessment  
**Establish patient’s level of communication and cognition. Remember that two-thirds of patients will have some degree of impaired intellectual and cognitive function.

Levels of hydration - they may be dehydrated.

**Last seizure?:** 25-35% of CP patients have seizure disorders.  
Epilepsy is a common comorbidity in spastic quadriplegia. So know what seizure medications the patient is on and how do they affect anesthesia. Antispasticity drugs like Baclofen should not be discontinued preoperatively because it may precipitate acute withdrawal.

**Does the patient still ambulate?** If not, you may have a limited cardiopulmonary reserve due to lack of exercise.

**Cardiac:** An EKG is not routine, but can be helpful.

**Respiratory** : Many children presenting for SDR will have a history of prematurity and associated neonatal lung disease. So there may be intra-or-post-op respiratory issues.

Reactive airway and/or restricted airway from scoliosis may be present and easily exacerbated. Respiratory muscle strength may be limited.

Excessive drooling may be present from poor oropharyngeal function.

**Lab work:** CBC and BMP, LFTs (CP meds may be hepatotoxic).

**Remember:** Antiseizure medications can lead to gingival hyperplasia, megaloblastic anemia, and altered responses to drugs metabolized by the liver.

**Latex Allergy:** CP patients are at increased risk of latex allergy due to repeated catheterization. We now treat them as if they already have latex allergy.

**Skin and nails:** Abnormalities may suggest specific micronutrient deficiencies. Many of these kids are malnourished with reduced growth and body weight measurements.

**Hydration status:** Assess for dehydration, this is common. Consider preoperative hydration.

**Residential or Assisted care living?** Kids in residential care facilities tend to have a significantly greater weight, height, skinfold thickness and better nourished than kids in assisted care living.  
  
**Pre-op**  
**Heat the room up:** These patients are prone to hypothermia and are like giant neonates. They have large surface area to body weight ratios and cannot conserve heat effectively.

Continue their anticonvulsants and antispasticity meds to avoid problems with acute withdrawal and worsening of seizure control.  
  
Avoid pre-op sedation for hypotonic patients because it may accentuate problems with upper airway muscle tone and increase the risk of aspiration perioperatively.

Pre-medicate with robinul if excessive drooling is present to facilitate tracheal intubation, unless they already had salivary gland surgery.  
**Medications:** **common medications used to treat cerebral palsy include:**

Anticholinergics (uncontrolled body movements)  
Anticonvulsants (seizure medications)  
Antidepressants (depression medications)  
Antispastic (muscle relaxers)  
Anti-inflammatories (pain management)  
Stool softeners.  
  
**Botulinum toxin (Botox A)** -acts peripherally

**Dantrolene sodium** - muscle cell membrane, causes weakness and hepatotoxic. This drug is not used with patients who can ambulate.

Centrally acting, muscle tone-reducing medications may decrease spasticity/seizures but cause central nervous system side effects.

**Baclofen (Lioresal)** - acts centrally  
**Diazepam (Valium)** - acts centrally  
**Vigabatrin (Sabril)** - acts centrally  
**Tizanidine (Zanaflex)** - acts centrally - alpha adrenergic, sedation and hepatotoxic, strong sedation and used at bedtime.  
**Valproate:** Acts centrally, antiseizure, increases GABA, related to liver toxicity.  
**Tranxene (Clorazepate Dipotassium)** GABA A mild sedation benzodiazepine analogue  
**Carbamazepime (Tegretol) -** antiepileptic**Clonazepam (Klonipin)  
Valproic Acid (Depakene) -** may cause transient thrombocytopenia, red cell aplasia and acquired von Willebrand desease may increase intraoperative bleeding.

The most common side effect of the above agents is sedation, which is often intolerable enough at the effective dose required to reduce tone that patients.

**Airway Assessment**  
**The patients may have a difficult airway due to:**  
Upper extremity or neck contracture  
Drooling  
Mental malocclusion  
Dental caries, loose teeth  
Accompanying temporomandibular joint ankylosis

**Aspiration Risk  
**As a result of ineffective cough and chronic aspiration of pooled pharyngeal secretions the development of recurrent pneumonia and respiratory morbidity is common. Chronic aspiration produces pulmonary mucosal damage leading to the development of reactive airway disease.

If the patient has had surgery before, locate the past anesthesia records when planning airway management.

**Anesthesia**  
**General/ETT with RSI  
**Many of these patients have a G tube as a result of their neurological dysfunction that impairs mobility and feedings and are an aspiration risk. Many have severe GERD.

**Propofol:** is the preferred anesthetic for induction.

**If Inhalation induction:** HOB should be up 20-30 degrees.

**Propofol Infusion:** NO, may contribute to myoclonus side effects that could interfere with the neuro monitoring.

**Regional:** Intrathecal narcotics with closure is common for post-op pain.

**Muscle Relaxants** : Not indicated. The surgeon needs to witness muscle contraction in response to direct electrical stimulation of the dorsal nerve roots with monitoring.

**Succinylcholine:** Is controversial with CP patients. Despite the fact of increased skeletal muscle spasticity, succinylcholine does NOT produce an abnormal release of potassium. Due to extrajunctional acetylcholine receptors, less succinylcholine is needed (lower dose). Many anesthesia providers avoid using succinylcholine.

**Volatile anesthetics:** Yes, check with monitor tech on your limit.

**Versed:** Anti-seizure medications (can effect CYP450 degradation pathways) causing reduced effectiveness of versed.

**Narcotics:** Drips are common if the monitor tech limits your inhalation agent. Propofol drips are not utilized, so narcotics are the next best thing. But remember, narcotics can accumulate resulting in over-sedation, suppress of the cough reflex, and depression of respiration in this already vulnerable patient.

**IV Tylenol and NSAIDS:** Yes

**Robinul:** Yes, for excess drooling.

**Electrophysiologic monitoring:** Yes, check with the monitor tech. Inhalation gases may need to be maintained under 1 MAC concentration. In addition, a fentanyl or remifentanil drip may be utilized and do not interfere with electrophysiologic monitoring.

**Positioning:** Prone

Non-weight-bearing long bones become osteopenic and vulnerable to fracture.

Warning: Non-ambulatory children with cerebral palsy are at increased risk for hip dislocation, compared with their ambulatory counterparts.

Position the patient CAREFULLY with appropriate padding.

Don’t force any position and use lots of pillows or blankets for padding. Forcing a position can cause skeletal or nerve damage. When in doubt, have the surgeon approve the positioning.

**Hypothermia:** Many patients with CP lack thermoregulation. Use a fluid warmer and an underbody warming blanket when possible. Hypothermia is a common post-op complication. Heat loss is a major consideration in CP patients because they have thin skin, very little subcutaneous fat, and atrophic musculature.

**Do not aggressively warm the patient**

Keep in mind esophageal temperature may increase significantly during electrical stimulation of dorsal roots. Therefore keep a close watch on temperature during key points of the procedure.

**Respiratory status change:** Mucus plugs should be considered if any changes. Considered irrigation and suctioning the ETT.

**Esophageal Temp:** Yes, core temp instead of skin temp.

**Foley catheter:** Usually, these can be long procedures.

**Duration:** 3-5 hours

**Hydration:** 4:2:1**  
(below is just a common reference)  
**Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

CP patients concerns in the operative period are as follows:  
Chronically low fluid intake (NPO status can increase the presentation of a hypovolemic state at the time of anesthetic).  
Hematocrit value can be as high as 55%.  
CP patients are at risk for pre-renal and postoperative renal failure.

It is imperative that perioperative fluid homeostasis is maintained. Strict monitoring of administered fluid, urinary output, and the replacement of blood and fluid deficit is required.

**EBL:** Minimal

  
**Emergence:** Awake extubation, these patients tend to wake up slow  

**Possible Complications**  
Paralysis of the legs and bladder  
Impotence  
Sensory loss  
Wound infection  
Meningitis  
CSF leak  
Abnormal sensitivity of the skin on the feet and legs-post-op and resolves in 6 weeks.  
Transient change in bladder control may occur.  
Recurrence of spasticity for the severe.

**Postop:** Consider ICU

**Common post operative issues:**  
Hypothermia  
Postoperative pain  
Anxiety  
Hypotension - Undiagnosed dehydration may contribute to hypotension.  
Hypoxemia - Pulmonary status is highly compromised post surgery due to diminished cough reflex and reduced respiratory drive.

**More Notes**  
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY  
Normal muscle tone depends on balanced excitatory and inhibitory influences on alpha motor neurons, which are nerves that begin in the spinal cord and travel via peripheral nerves to innervate skeletal muscles. Alpha motor neurons are the principle effectors of motor tone and control. Inhibitory interneurons influence alpha motor neurons within the spinal cord and are activated by cortical upper motor neurons. Excitatory influences come from both muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs, which are located in the skeletal muscle/tendon, and send information to the spinal cord via afferent sensory fibers of peripheral nerves.

Brain injury in cerebral palsy prevents descending spinal cord tracts from providing the necessary inhibitory influence, creating an imbalance of overabundant excitatory input. The stretch reflex arc between the spinal cord and skeletal muscle continues to receive excitatory input from Ia afferents traveling from the muscle through the peripheral sensory nerve’s dorsal root, without adequate opposing inhibition from the brain’s descending tracts, ultimately causing what is termed spasticity. Spasticity is defined as a velocity-dependent increase in stretch reflexes, which translates to a clinical increase in resistance to passive movement. By decreasing the excitatory afferent input from the dorsal roots, the amount of excitation experienced by the alpha motor neurons can be reduced, therefore reducing spasticity.
