### Neuraxial and Preservative Free Local Anesthetics/Narcotics

**PF Morphine = Astromorph or Duramorph**  
  
Hospitals advise using only preservative-free agents for neuraxial Anesthesia.Today we use only preservative free (PF) solutions in OB for regional anesthesia.  
Read the labels, ensure that it is preservative free or prepared for epidural/caudal anesthesia/analgesia.Several studies and articles document the negative side effects of injecting preservatives into the intrathecal space or with blind epidural injections.  
  
**Example:  
**Motor and sensory deficits have resulted from the injection of local anesthetics with preservatives into the subarachnoid space.  
  
The combination of acidic pH and bisulfite preservatives is responsible for these spinal neuropathies  
  
**Here are some examples below:  
**Morphine preserved with phenol and formaldehyde was administered daily for about 10 days in a 50-year-old man receiving an epidural for cancer pain. Epidural tissue damage was shown on epidurogram. Confusion and disorientation, thought to be secondary to chronic administration of preservative into the CNS, reversed when the patient received a preservative-free opioid.

In another case, a 24-year-old woman in labor inadvertently received an epidural injection of saline containing benzyl alcohol. The patient developed numbness and prickling sensations in the lower extremities. She was unable to lift her legs and unable to void. At 9 weeks, she could walk with crutches and void independently, but weakness remained and reflexes were absent in the lower extremities. At 16 months, she had almost a full recovery with the exception of leg cramps.

**Some Documentations Says it is OK  
**On the flip side, there is documentation that suggested that “parabens are safe when administered intrathecally the small doses associated with preservative use.” As early as 1977, methylparaben was found to have no adverse effects on rabbit spinal cord.  
  
One article stated that there is currently no literature of adverse effects from preservatives after properly performed image-guided injections!  
  
**Why Are Preservatives Added to Drugs?** Preservatives are added to many drugs to prevent or inhibit the growth of microorganisms that may have been introduced during the manufacturing processMany drugs intended for epidural use (such as steroids, opioids, and 2-chloroprocaine) contain antioxidants or preservatives, or are formulated with vehicles known as excipients.  
  
**Excipients:** an inactive substance used as a diluent or vehicle for delivery of active ingredients. Preservatives are often added to local anesthetics dispensed in multi-dose containers and less commonly added to drugs intended for single use.  
  
**Despite Conflicting Literature, We Still Use PF Local Anesthetics and Narcotics in OB  
  
**_It is in the standard of care that OB regional anesthesia injections should not contain any preservatives (such as benzyl alcohol and parabens-containing compounds) since there was an increased risk of adverse neurological events._
