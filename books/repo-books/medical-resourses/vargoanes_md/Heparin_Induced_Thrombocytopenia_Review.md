### Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia Review

**Note:**  
**HITT:** Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis  
**HIT:** Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia

**Two types of HIT (Type I and Type II)**  
  
**Type 1 HIT (non-immune)  
**Mild transient thrombocytopenia affects up to 10% of patients within the first 48-72 hours after exposure to heparin (rarely less than 100,000 platelets/μl).  
Usually develops within the first two days of starting heparin.  
Platelet count quickly returns to normal when heparin is discontinued.  
Most are undiagnosed.  
  
_Most discussions of HIT refer to type 2 HIT._  
  
**Type 2 HIT (immune mediated)  
**Affects around 2-3%. Thrombocytopenia occurs 4-14 days after exposure.  
  
1% occurrence with LMWH  
About 1/3 of Type 2 HIT patients will develop thrombosis in extremities or PE.  
**  
Manifestations of HIT**  
Platelet count decreases to less than 50% of baseline after receiving heparin.  
Skin lesions appear at heparin injection sites  
Acute systemic reactions occur (e.g. chills, fever, dyspnea, chest pain)  
**  
Diagnosis of HIT  
**Onset of thrombocytopenia after heparin.  
Presence of HIT antibodies “platelet factor 4 (PF4).”  
  
**Treatment of HIT  
**Immediate discontinuation of heparin products (including flushes of IV catheters).  
Alternative anticoagulants  
**  
Pathophysiology  
****Note:** Platelet factor 4 (PF-4) is a small positively charged molecule that is stored and released from the alpha granules in platelets.  
  
When platelets are activated, PF-4 is released into the circulation and some of it binds to the platelet surface. Because of opposite charges, heparin and other glycosaminoglycans bind to the PF-4 molecules. These new complex molecules appear as a foreign substance and the body produces an IgG antibody against the heparin-PF4 complex.  
  
The newly formed HIT antibodies bind to the PF-4 complexes on the surface of platelets and trigger activation and aggregation of the platelets. Activated platelets release more PF4, thus perpetuating the cycle of heparin-induced platelet activation. This leads to the production of prothrombotic platelet microparticles, which promote coagulation and thrombosis.  
  
Heparin-like molecules (heparan sulfate) on the surface of endothelial cells and the HIT antibody-PF4-heparan sulfate complexes may induce tissue factor expression promoting a coagulation cascade and thrombin generation within the blood vessels.

**Note:** As platelet activation is occurring, so is thrombocytopenia.  
  
**Diagnosis of HIT**  
Thrombocytopenia–a drop in platelet count to less than100k or a decrease from the patient's baseline platelet count of greater than 50% (platelet count decreases to less than 50% of baseline).  
Exclusion of other causes of thrombocytopenia  
Resolution of thrombocytopenia after cessation of heparin  
HIT antibodies present in immunoassays  
Heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) and the serotonin release assay (SRA).  
SRA is more sensitive  
  
**Treatment of HIT**  
Immediate cessation of all formulations of heparin. Unfortunately, this will NOT stop continuing thrombin generation nor avoid subsequent thrombotic events, which occur in as many as 40–50% of the patients over the next several days or weeks.  
  
**Use an alternate anticoagulant that does NOT cross-react with HIT antibodies:**  
Bivalirudin (Angiomax)  
Argatroban (Acova)  
Fondaparinux (Arixtra)  
Lepirudin (Refludan, recombinant hirudin)  
Desirudin (Revask, Iprivask, Hirudin)  
Danaparoid-Not available in the US  
  
LMWH cannot be used in patients with HIT because of the strong cross-reactivity of the HIT antibody with the LMW heparin/PF4 complex.  
  
Anticoagulation treatment is required for at least 2 to 3 months to prevent recurrence of thrombosis.
