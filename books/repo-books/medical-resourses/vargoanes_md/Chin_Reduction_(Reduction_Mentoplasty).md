### Chin Reduction (Reduction Mentoplasty)

Reduction of an overly large or protruding chin may be done by either direct reduction or sliding genioplasty.  
  
In a **direct reduction:** The surgeon makes either a submental or an intraoral incision and  
removes excess bone from the chin with a burr.  
A **sliding genioplasty reduction:** Similar to a genioplasty to augment the chin, except that the  
bone segment is moved backward rather than forward.  
  
**Pre-op**  
Patients should stop smoking and discontinue all medications containing **aspirin** or NSAIDs for two weeks prior to any mentoplasty.  
If the surgeon is planning to make a submental incision, the patient should use an antibacterial facial cleanser for two days before surgery.  
Patients scheduled for an intraoral approach should rinse the mouth with mouthwash three times a day for two days before surgery.  
Patients should not eat or drink anything for eight hours prior to the procedure.  
  
**Anesthesia for direct chin reduction:** General/ETT, or LMA.  
**Anesthesia for sliding genioplasty reduction:** General/Nasal or oral ETT.  
**Duration:** 1-3 minutes.  
**Position:** Supine, arms tucked; table rotated 45-90 degrees.  
**EBL:** Minimal.  
  
**Possible Complications  
**Infection.Deformity of the chin due to infection.Injury to the major nerve in the chin, leading to loss of feeling or paralysis of the chin muscles.Erosion of the bone beneath the implant.Displacement or dislocation of the implant.  
Extrusion (pushing out) of the implant.  
  
**Specific risks associated with sliding genioplasties include:**  
Under- or over-correction of the defect.  
Injury to the major nerve in the chin.  
Failure of the bone segment to reunite properly with the other parts of the jaw.  
Damage to the roots of the teeth.  
  
Hematoma (a collection of blood caused by leakage from broken blood vessels) can damage the results of a mentoplasty by causing pressure that distorts the final shape of the chin.  
  
**Fat injections**  
In some cases, fat may be injected into the area below the chin to bolster the skin and minimize the apparent size of the chin.  
This technique, however, is limited to minor disproportions of chin size.  
Fat injections must be repeated periodically because the fat is gradually resorbed by the body.  
  
**Liposuction  
**Facial liposuction can be used together with or instead of mentoplasty to improve the patient's profile.  
Removal of fatty tissue below the chin can make a receding chin look larger or more prominent.
