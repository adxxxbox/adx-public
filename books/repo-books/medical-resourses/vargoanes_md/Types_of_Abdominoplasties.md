### Types of Abdominoplasties

In a complete or full abdominoplasty, the surgeon makes an incision above the pubic area, running across the hip. A second incision is made to release the navel from the skin.  
The surgeon then removes the skin from the abdominal wall to expose the muscle and connective tissue. Using sutures, the surgeon tightens the muscle and connective tissue to the abdominal wall. Depending on the patient and surgeon’s preference, liposuction may be used to further refine the abdominal wall.  
  
Communicate with the surgical team regarding the necessity for muscle relaxation, which will make an endotracheal tube preferable to an LMA.  
  
**Partial Abdominoplasty**  
A partial or mini abdominoplasty is similar to the complete abdominoplasty, but involves fewer incisions. The surgeon makes a single, small incision above the public area and removes the exposed excess skin and fat. Next, the surgeon will tighten the muscle and connective tissue, securing them with sutures if needed.  
  
Liposuction may also be used in partial abdominoplasty.  
  
Communicate with the surgical team regarding the necessity for muscle relaxation, which will make an endotracheal tube preferable to an LMA.  
  
**Extended Abdominoplasty**  
This is technically a combination of a complete abdominoplasty and a thigh lift.  
The surgeon performs an abdominoplasty to contour the patient’s abdominal wall, as well as a thigh lift to promote a smoother upper lateral thigh.  
Intubation is most commonly done due to the duration of the procedure.
