### Acoustic Neuroma (Vestibular Schwannoma)

Removal of a tumor that grows from the sheath covering the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII).  Also known as the Acoustic Nerve.  
  
This surgery requires an otologist and a neurosurgeon.

This cranial nerve is responsible for balance and hearing. The tumor is usually benign and grows slowly. Because of the slow growth, not all acoustic neuromas need to be treated. Treatment options include observation, surgery, and radiation. The cause of an acoustic neuroma is uncertain. Most patients are between 30-60 years of age.  

Depending on the size, acoustic neuromas can be attached to the facial nerve, trigeminal nerve, brainstem, and blood vessels. If the tumor is large, its size must be reduced so that the surgeon has enough room to see how it is attached to nerves. An incision is made in the tumor capsule and the center of the tumor is hollowed out or debulked.  
In some cases, it is safer to leave a small portion of the tumor behind than remove it in its entirety and risk permanent loss of some function. A microscope is used.  
After the tumor is removed, the internal auditory canal is sealed with bone wax, and a small piece of muscle is glued over the opening. This prevents cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from leaking into the middle ear. The dura is closed in watertight fashion and biologic glue is applied to prevent CSF leakage. The bone flap is replaced and secured with titanium plates and screws. The muscles and skin incisions are then rejoined and sutured together

**One of three possible approaches exist:**  
**Suboccipital:** A retro-mastoid incision is made to the cerebellopontine angle and retraction of the cerebellum is necessary. A piece of the facial nerve may be removed.  
**Translabyrinthine:** Removes mastoid bone and bone of the inner ear for access of the ear canal and tumor.  
**Middle fossa:** Incision 1-2 inches behind the back of the ear into the scalp and temporalis muscle. The choice of a particular craniotomy depends on the tumor size, tumor position, and hearing status.

**Anesthetic**: General/ETT  
**Position:** Depends on surgeon preference. Usually The Park-Bench Position  or modified lateral.  
**Mayfield Pins:** Yes  
**Facial Nerve Monitoring:**  Yes, so no paralysis.  
**Duration:** 2-4 hours  
**A-line:** Usually  
**IV steroids:** yes  
**Smooth emergence:** Requested  
**EBL:** 50-100mLs

**Possible Complications**  
Facial nerve damage  
CSF leak  
Hemorrhage  
Mayfield Pin lacerations  
Infection  
Hearing Loss  
Stroke  
Balance difficulties  
Anesthesia complications  
  
**Facial weakness:** This may occur from the loss of muscle control on one side of the face caused by nerve swelling or damage; it may be temporary or permanent.  
Temporary facial paralysis or weakness is common after surgery and may persist for 6 to 12 months. Those with facial weakness will need to take extra care of their affected eye with artificial tears and lubricant until facial nerve function improves.

**More Notes:**

**Possible Symptoms:**  
Hearing loss from pressure on the nerve  
Dizziness  
Ringing in the ears  
Loss of balance  
Facial numbness and weakness.  
  
**Suboccipital Craniotomy**  
A section of the skull is removed behind the ear to access the tumor and nerves.  
**The goals of surgery are:**  
Maintenance of facial nerve function  
Preservation of hearing in the affected ear  
Tumor removal
