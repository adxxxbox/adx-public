# Ca Channel Blockers Differences  
(Cardene versus Verapamil versus Cardizem)

  

There are two basic types of calcium channel blockers, dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine.

**Non-dihydropyridine** - can slow down the heart rate **dihydropyridine** does not slow down heart rate.

* * *

**Cardene (Nicardipine)** is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, which means that it does not usually decrease the heart rate. However, it systemically vasodilates to drop blood pressure.

* * *

**Verapamil (Isoptin)** is more selective to lower the heart rate and is less effective as a systemic vasodilator drug. However it is still used to treat high blood pressure and to control angina. Its great for treating angina because it reduces heart rate-thus myocardial oxygen demand, reverses coronary vasospasm and arrhythmias.

**Cardizem (Diltiazem) (benzothiazepine class)** is intermediate between non-dihydropyridines (verapamil) and dihydropyridines (Cardene) in its selectivity for vascular calcium channels. So it is used to treat rapid A-fib because it slows conduction through the AV node, causes vasodilation, decreases rate of ventricular response, decreases myocardial oxygen demand.
