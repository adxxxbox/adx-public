Branchial Cyst, Sinuses and Fistulas by Surgical Incision   

## Branchial Cyst, Sinuses and Fistulas by Surgical Incision

This is a lateral neck procedure that requires general anesthesia/ETT or LMA with usually little blood loss.

Branchial cleft anomalies may cause lateral neck masses that may affect the nearby neck structures, causing compressive symptoms or vessel thrombosis. They may present with infection, cyst enlargement or fistulas.

95% of congenital anomalies of the branchial apparatus involve the second branchial arch, pouch, or cleft.

Branchial anomalies may present as a cyst, sinus, or fistula.

**Fistula: 22% frequency; it is a where a** complete connection exists between the skin and pharynx.

**Sinus** : 42% frequency: it is a blind pouch that is attached to either the skin or pharynx.

**Cyst:** 30% frequency; this anomaly may occur independently, or in association with a branchial pouch sinus or fistula.

  
Branchial anomalies typically present in infancy and childhood, but diagnosis may occur at any age. 89% are on the right side of the body.

Just be aware that the different types of Branchial Cleft Cysts are different procedures with different potential complications. See notes at the bottom.

**Indications for Treatment:**

Infection

Mass effect (dysphagia, dyspnea, pain).

Cosmetic

**Treatmen** t-complete surgical excision.

**Age Range:** Neonate –Adult.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT or LMA, depends how extensive the procedure is.  
**Airway:** The neck may be swollen and inflamed from infection, but usually not enough to impede the airway. Always assess.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Sometimes; check with the surgeon.  
**Position:** Supine, with arms to the side. Shoulder roll with donut beneath the cranium so that the neck is extended. Head of bed is raised slightly to decrease venous blood pressure in the head and neck.

The chin is turned away from the operative side.  
**Duration:** 1-4 hours is the norm.  
**A-line:** Not needed, usually.  
**IV Access:** One good flowing IV that is age appropriate. Large bore not required. NS or LR for crystalloids; and have albumin ready.  
**Hydration: 4:2:1** (below is just a common reference)Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg  

**A-line:** Not needed.

**Blood Bolus dose:** 10-20cc/kg if needed.

**EBL** : usually minimal. The surgeon identifies and isolates the jugular vein and carotid arteries when anatomically necessary.  
**EBV: Estimates of volumes of circulating blood:**

3 months to 1 year: 70-80cc/kg.

1-4 years: 70cc/kg.  
Adult: 55-60cc/kg.

**Age Range:** Neonate – Adult.  
**  
Contraindications:**

Acute infection (treat prior to excision).

Medical contraindication to elective surgery.

  
**Possible Complications:  
**Hemorrhage-rare.  
Neighboring nerve damage –depends on location.
