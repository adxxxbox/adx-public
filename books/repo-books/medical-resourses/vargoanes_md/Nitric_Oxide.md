### Nitric Oxide (NO)

Nitric oxide should not be confused with nitrous oxide (N2O), an anesthetic inhalation agent or with nitrogen dioxide (NO2).  
NO2is a toxic product of NO and is rapidly oxidized in air.  
  
NO is usually not administered by anesthesia providers; instead it is administered by respiratory care practitioners upon request.  
  
Nitric oxide was formerly known as endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF).  
Nitric oxide (NO) is one of the three common oxides of nitrogen, along with nitrous oxide  
N2O) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2).  
**  
NO sources  
****Endogenously** by endothelial cells throughout the body and acts as a biological mediator.  
**Exogenously** inhaled through a medical delivery system.  
  
**Endogenous production of NO  
**Healthy humans produce about 1 millimole (mM) of endogenous nitric oxide per day within the endothelium in response to changes in blood viscosity (shear stress).  
Systemic arteries throughout the body are always in a partially relaxed state because of NO.  
  
**Factors decreasing NO production through endothelial dysfunction  
**Smoking  
Hypercholesterolemia  
Oxidative stress  
Limited physical exercise  
  
Nitric oxide is used to treat about 35,000 hospitalized U.S. patients each year – mostly adults with pulmonary hypertension and infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN) of the newborn.  
  
**NO is expensive:** Five-day treatment of a newborn with PPHN may costs around $14,000.  
  
_Clinical use is of NO is limited by its potential toxicity._  
  
**Administration of exogenously inhaled nitric oxide (INO)  
**Nitric oxide is administered as an inhaled gas (INO).  
In the US it is supplied in a 0.8% concentration with nitrogen (99.2%).  
  
A variety of devices is available to add the nitric oxide to the inspired gas.  
The best systems adjust the nitric oxide/nitrogen mixture flow rate to keep a constant inspired concentration even if the minute ventilation is altered.  
The NO is delivered in the inspiratory side of the ventilator circuit anywhere proximal to the endotracheal tube in units of parts per million (ppm).  
The delivery system is designed to minimize the oxidation of nitric oxide to nitrogen dioxide.  
  
**NO - Mechanism of Action**  
_NO dilates the pulmonary vasculature and thus decreases pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)._  
  
The nitric oxide causes smooth muscle relaxation by activating the membrane-bound enzyme guanylate cyclase and increasing the concentration of the second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) which modulates calcium concentrations in the vascular smooth muscle cell and decreases tone.  
INO improves oxygenation because it is administered only to areas of the lung that are ventilated. In these areas it causes vasodilatation, thus improving V/Q matching.  
  
**NO inhibits hypoxic pulmonary vasocontraction** (HPVC)  
Inhaled NO increases blood flow toward ventilated areas of the lungs by dilating local pulmonary vessels. This reduces intrapulmonary shunting, improves ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) matching, and therefore increases arterial oxygenation. The pulmonary vasculature of non-ventilated lung units is not affected. INO thus improves V/Q matching and increases PaO2.  
  
**INO and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN)**  
PPHN is a condition when increased PVR increases the right ventricular and atrial pressures, re-opening the foramen ovale and causing right-to-left intracardiac shunting. The resulting hypoxemia may result in re-opening of the ductus arteriosus and further shunting.  
  
Traditional treatment consists of intravenous alkali and hyperventilation to induce an alkalosis state that causes some vasodilatation.  
ECMO is very aggressive and a last resort.  
Semi-selective pulmonary vasodilators have not been successful.  
INO has been much more successful compared to traditional treatment.  
INO administered in PPHN considerably reduces the number of babies requiring salvage treatment with extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).  
  
**Why INO does not affect systemic blood pressure  
**INO is rapidly metabolized and has a half-life less than 5 seconds and has no effect on systemic blood pressure.  
It is quickly inactivated upon entering the blood and binds with hemoglobin.  
  
**NO binds with hemoglobin**  
Once NO enters the blood, it binds with hemoglobin and forms methemoglobin and nitrate  
when the hemoglobin saturation is 60 – 100%.  
At lower saturations NO binds with deoxyhemoglobin to form nitrosyl hemoglobin.  
This breaks down to N2O and methemoglobin.  
  
**Indications of INO  
**Treatment of neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure associated with pulmonary hypertension to improve oxygenation, reducing the need for ECMO.  
  
Treatment of acute increase in PVR following cardiopulmonary bypass.  
  
Preoperative pulmonary hypertension with specific lesions including total anomalous pulmonary venous return and congenital mitral stenosis.  
  
As a diagnostic tool to distinguish reactive pulmonary hypertension from fixed anatomic obstructive disease in post-surgical patients or those being worked up for transplantation.  
  
**Potential benefits of NO**  
Mild bronchodilation  
Improved V/Q matching  
Decreased pulmonary shunts to the lungs  
Decreased RV pressure  
Decreased intracardiac shunt  
Increased RV ejection fraction (RVEF)  
Decreased pulmonary artery pressure (PAP)  
Decreased PVR  
Increased cardiac output (CO)  
Increased PaO2  
  
**Storage of NO  
**NO is stored in aluminum or stainless-steel cylinders which typically contain 40 liters.  
It is usually supplied as 1,000 ppm in nitrogen (it oxidizes slowly in contact with oxygen).  
Pure NO is corrosive and toxic.  
  
**NO Toxicity**  
Toxicity of NO arises from accumulation of N2O and methemoglobin.  
Methemoglobinemia is rare at normal doses.  
  
INO can rapidly react with the oxygen in the lung to rapidly form NO2 which is a highly toxic substance.  
  
**NO2 is thought to cause:**  
Silo-filler's disease  
Related lung syndromes  
Pulmonary edema  
Hemorrhage  
Bronchiolitis obliterans  
  
NO also reacts with superoxide anion to form peroxynitrite, a cytotoxic oxidant that may interfere with the functioning of lung surfactant.  
  
**NO is also found in cigarette smoke**  
NO is found in cigarette smoke at levels of 100 ppm or higher and may be an etiologic agent in development of lung disease in smokers.  
  
**Doses of INO  
**INO at 3-20 ppm improves oxygenation.  
20 ppm is a frequently-used dose, usually decreased then weaned.  
Doses up to 80 ppm decrease pulmonary arterial pressure and decrease PVR, but increase the risk of toxicity.  
It may be administered for up to 14 days, or until the underlying desaturation is resolved.  
  
**Administration of INO  
**Delivery systems may deliver NO accurately between 1-80 ppm.  
  
INO in nitrogen is administered to the inspiratory limb of the ventilator circuit in either a pulse or continuous mode to deliver a constant inspired concentration.  
  
The delivery system is designed to minimize the oxidation of nitric oxide to nitrogen dioxide.  
  
**Contraindications of NO**  
Any condition dependent on a right to left shunt.  
Methemoglobinemia.  
  
**Possible side effects of NO  
**Inhaled nitric oxide has little side-effects.  
Methemoglobinemia occurs but is not normally clinically significant.  
Some patient groups (American Indians, neonates, congenital methemoglobinemia) may be at increased risk of methemoglobinemia because they have reduced or absent methemoglobin reductase activity.  
  
**INO must be weaned**  
If nitric oxide is suddenly stopped, rebound pulmonary hypertension and hypoxemia may occur. Therefore, slow weaning and back-up equipment are required.  
  
**NO advantage over IV pulmonary vasodilators  
**Inhaled NO does not decrease systemic blood pressure and thereby jeopardize coronary perfusion pressure to the right ventricle.  
  
**Conditions under which NO has little effect on PVR**  
NO has little effect on patients without pulmonary hypertension; normal PVR.  
Pulmonary hypertension secondary to fixed or fibrotic disease.  
Pulmonary hypertension secondary to an increased cardiac output.  
  
**NO effects on right ventricular (RV) function**  
When NO is administered to a patient who has pulmonary hypertension and NORMAL RV function, there will a minimal change with RV ejection fraction (EF) or cardiac output (CO).  
However, in a patient with pulmonary hypertension and RV dysfunction, there will be an improvement of RF EF and CO.  
  
**Sepsis and NO**  
During endotoxemia and sepsis, NO is produced in large amounts by the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). NO is a major mediator of hemodynamic changes associated with the vasodilation with sepsis.  
  
**Systemic Effects of endogenous NO**  
  
**Vascular endothelium:** Responsible for vascular relaxation.  
**Platelets:** involved in aggregation and adhesion.  
**Brain tissue:** acts as a neurotransmitter.  
**Macrophages:** involved in the response to infection.  
**Respiratory:** pulmonary vasodilation, may reverse hypoxia and inhibits HPVC  
**Gastrointestinal:** Only appears to modulate morphine-induced constipation.  
**Genitourinary:** Role in sodium homeostasis in the kidney.  
**Neuronal:** The physiological modulator of penile arousal, pain perception, Apoptosis and long term neuronal depression and excitement.  
**Immune:** Macrophages and neutrophils synthesize NO which can be toxic to certain pathogens and may be important in host defense mechanisms.  
**Hemostasis:** None; NO and prostacyclin (PGI2) inhibit platelet aggregation and platelet or monocyte adhesion to the endothelium, and stimulate platelet disaggregation.  
  
**Metabolism  
**Inhaled NO readily reacts with oxidized hemoglobin to yield methemoglobin.  
Half-life: less than 5 seconds.  
  
**Monitoring  
**Chemiluminescence and electrochemical gas analyzers should be used and are accurate to 1 ppm.  
  
Inhaled NO combines with hemoglobin and increases methemoglobin levels.  
  
Daily methemoglobin monitoring is required.  
Increase in methemoglobin level is usually modest, although case reports of high levels (> 5%) exist.  
  
Methemoglobin levels also may increase in patients with deficiencies of methemoglobin reductase.  
  
**Toxicity  
**Exposure to 500-2000 ppm of NO results in methemoglobinemia and pulmonary edema.  
Methemoglobinemia is only rarely significant and is more common in pediatric patients or those with methemoglobin reductase deficiency.  
Contamination by nitrogen dioxide can similarly lead to pneumonitis and pulmonary edema.  
Environmental levels should not exceed 25 ppm for 8 hours (time-weighted average).  
  
**Onset:** Immediate.  
**Duration:** Less than 5 second half-life and transient.  
NO needs a continuous administration to last longer than 5 seconds.  
**Usual dose:** 20 parts per million up to 14 days or until the resolution of pulmonary hypertension.  
**Metabolism:** Nitrate has been identified as the predominant nitric oxide metabolite excreted in the urine, accounting for >70% of the nitric oxide dose inhaled. Nitrate is cleared from the plasma by the kidney at rates approaching the rate of glomerular filtration.  
  
The uptake into the red blood cells with subsequent conversion to nitrate and methemoglobin is a major metabolic pathway for endogenously formed NO.  
  
There is some plasma and urinary clearance of NO in healthy subjects averaging 20 mL/min.  
  
**Pregnancy category:** C  
  
**Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and NO**  
  
People can be exposed to nitric oxide in the workplace by inhalation. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limits for nitric oxide exposure in the workplace. For this reason, sophisticated NO delivery systems were designed to minimize the oxidation of nitric oxide to nitrogen dioxide.  
  
Continuous monitoring of inspired NO and NO2 concentrations is mandatory to protect against inadvertent delivery of toxic doses.  
  
**Exhalation scavengers are required**  
Scavenger systems: Nitric oxide, nitric dioxide, and other dioxides can be safely scavenged on the exhalation side allowing safe administration of nitric oxide free from environmental contamination with nitric oxide and its oxides.
