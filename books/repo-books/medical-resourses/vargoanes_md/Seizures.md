### Seizures

  
_Daniel D. Moose, CRNA_

Since the epidural space has a rich supply of veins, up to 10% of all epidural injections may have some local anesthetic placed into a vein rather than 100% in the epidural space. If a large volume of epidural solution is injected intravenously, a seizure may occur. This can be prevented by careful aspiration on the needle before and during the injection. Benzodiazepines and hyperventilation raise the threshold of local anesthetic induced seizures. Respiratory support must be provided.
