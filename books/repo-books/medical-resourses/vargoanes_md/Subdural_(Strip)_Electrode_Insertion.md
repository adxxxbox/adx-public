### Subdural (Strip) Electrode Insertion

_This type of craniotomy procedure is very superficial, involves very little blood loss, and an arterial line is usually not warranted._  
  
**Electrocorticography (ECOG), or intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG):**  
This is a type of electrophysiological monitoring that uses electrodes placed directly on the exposed surface of the brain to record electrical activity from the cerebral cortex. The patient will return to ICU for the monitoring. Once the specific areas of the brain are identified in the ICU as probable locations for the epileptogenic zone and deemed potentially resectable, a craniotomy can then be tailored based on preoperative epilepsy studies.  
The procedure is a simple craniotomy in which the surgeon opens the cranium, gently places EEG electrodes-strips or grids on the surface of the cerebral cortex, then covers the area with a scalp flap.  
Following placement of the flap, electrode wires are tunneled to the skin for eventual connection to an iEEG monitor.  
  
**Note:** A bone flap is not used while the electrodes are in place because some patients gradually accumulate subdural fluid and blood over the electrodes and may require an emergent decompression. The bone flap is replaced in the 2 nd procedure with removal or the electrodes followed by resection.  
A temporary epidural drain is used to decrease the risk of postoperative fluid collection.  
**  
Before Closure**  
Before closure of the dura, color photographs and sketches are prepared to record the location of the electrodes in relation to the major lobes and fissures/sulci.  
Adequate recording from the implanted electrodes is confirmed before closure.  
  
The patient will return and stay in the ICU for approximately one to two weeks.  
During that time, continuous telemetry is performed to record the onset of seizure activity. Typically, antiepileptic medications are tapered to facilitate the capture of seizure activity.  
The goal is to pinpoint that small portion of the brain (origin) that is responsible for the seizure activity. Once that is accomplished, the patient is then evaluated for resective epilepsy surgery to follow.  
  
**Positioning of the Electrodes**  
Placement of the subdural electrodes requires planning and collaboration between the neurosurgeon and epilepsy neurologist. It is not practical nor safe to cover the entire surface of the brain with electrodes.  
The preoperative workup must narrow the search for an epileptogenic zone sufficiently to plan targeted placement of the electrodes.  
  
**About the Electrodes**  
The electrodes are sutured along their various borders to the edges of the dura to avoid their displacement during the extraoperative monitoring period.  
  
**Subdural Monitoring and Electrodes**  
This monitoring is much more specific than the external (scalp) monitoring.  
Subdural electrodes are thin plastic objects that lie on the surface of the cortex and are connected to wires that in turn connect to an external monitor. The more complex subdural electrodes are called “grids.” The grids are square or rectangular, intended to cover a larger surface area and are placed over the cortical convexity. Some neurosurgeons prefer to use grid electrodes in combination with strip electrodes.  
These electrodes may also be used to stimulate (trigger) auras or seizures during this functional mapping session.  
  
**While in the ICU  
**In the ICU, an intracranial study will prepare the patient for a second operation when a more guided craniotomy is performed to delineate the seizure focus. This technique has the advantage of allowing bedside removal of the strip electrodes in selected patients. To decrease the risk of infection, a 6-week period is allotted before a craniotomy with more extensive targeted electrode placement is contemplated (interval averages 1-2 weeks).  
  
**Anesthesia Considerations**  
Always confer with the surgeon when planning anesthesia.  
Avoid medications that would interfere with the ECOG.  
High doses of benzodiazepines, barbiturates and certain inhaled halogenated agents interfere with ECOG.  
1.5 MAC sevoflurane is the maximum dose supported by evidence.  
Precedex is acceptable.  
Other reports indicate that nitrous oxide at concentrations less than 50% or 0.5 MAC isoflurane allow for ECOG.  
Alfentanil, sufentanil, remifentanil, fentanyl, and methohexital have all been shown to enhance ECOG activity.  
Remifentanil may prove particularly useful since it can suppress activity in normal cortex, while increasing activity in abnormal cortex  
  
**Pre-op preparation:  
**Extra syringe of propofol if the surgeon is utilizing Mayfield pins (These are not always used).  
  
**Versed:** 2 mg or less of Versed should be acceptable; effects are usually dissipated by the time of the ECOG study at the end of the procedure.  
  
**Anesthesia:** General/ETT  
**Induction:** RSI not usually required  
**Nitrous:** Not indicated**Muscle Relaxation:** Yes**Position:** Supine and head up 20-30 degrees, sometimes more at the surgeon’s discretion.  
The OR table is turned 90-180 degrees.  
Head is slightly elevated.  
Arms are tucked. It is good to connect a phenylephrine drip to an IV port before tucking the arms.  
**Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**EBL:** Minimal, involving mere placement of leads on the surface of the cerebral cortex.  
**IV Access:** 1-2. Redundant placement of IV access provides a backup.  
**A-line:** Sometimes used, but not really indicated.**Hydration:** Normal. Avoid overhydration which will cause cerebral edema.**Emergence:** Deep extubation is acceptable.  
Post-emergence neurologic checks are not required.Most of these patients are directly returned to the neurosurgical ICU.  
_Warning when transferring the patient from the OR table:_ The patient has a soft spot over the skin flap where part of the cranium was removed. Avoid applying any pressure to that area.**  
  
Possible Complications  
**Infection: 2-3%  
CSF leak: rare  
Intracerebral hemorrhages < 1%  
Accumulation of subdural fluid and blood over the electrodes  
Headaches  
Orbital swelling  
  
**More Notes**  
Any patient considered for this study must have exhausted all noninvasive diagnostic options for localization of their epileptogenic zone.  
  
Intracranial epilepsy monitoring is a useful tool for the planning of resective epilepsy surgery. Techniques to advance the safety and minimize complications will lead to improved outcomes.  
  
These studies are particularly helpful for more precisely localizing seizure activity that has been identified with scalp EEG recordings.  
  
Implanted EEG electrodes also can be used to stimulate the brain and map cortical and subcortical neurologic functions, such as motor or language function, in preparation for epilepsy surgery. This information is then used in conjunction with the seizure data to plan operative intervention.  
  
Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common type of surgically treatable epilepsy, with a considerable number of patients needing invasive electroencephalography monitoring.  
  
**Grid and Strip Electrodes**  
Consist of silver, platinum, or stainless-steel disks embedded in a Teflon or Silastic sheath.  
Strips are configured as small as 1 × 4 electrodes or as large as 2 × 8 electrodes.  
Grids are configured from 4 × 4 up to 8 × 8 electrodes for a total of 16 to 64 contacts, respectively. The contacts are typically spaced 5-10 mm apart.
