### Causes of Inadequate Anesthesia or Analgesia

_Daniel D. Moos, CRNA_

The rate of block failure is relatively low.  
However, the anesthesia provider must be prepared to supplement a marginal block or convert to a general anesthetic.  
  
The rate of block failure decreases as experience with spinals and epidurals increases.  
  
**Inadequate anesthesia from a spinal may be associated with** outdated or improperly stored local anesthetics. For example, tetracaine will lose potency when stored for long periods in a warm environment.  
  
**Spinal Administration**  
Once free flowing CSF is noted, the clinician must be careful not to move the needle before and during injection. It is helpful to confirm aspiration of CSF before injection of local anesthetic solution, midway through the injection, and after the injection. This should decrease the risk of placing the local anesthetic in an area other than the subarachnoid space.  
  
**Subdural Injection  
**Even with free flowing CSF, it is possible that the opening of the spinal needle is not entirely in the subarachnoid space. This will result in a partial subdural injection and a partial spinal block.  
  
**Epidural anesthesia is more subjective  
**With a spinal anesthetic, CSF confirms that the needle is in the correct anatomical space. The administration of epidural anesthesia relies on the “loss of resistance” or “hanging drop” technique. Either technique may lead to false positives. In addition, anatomy varies among patients. The spread of local anesthetics in the epidural space is less predictable.  
  
**Factors that may contribute to inadequate neuraxial anesthesia  
The spinal ligament may be soft**  
The spinal ligament may be soft, resulting in never achieving a “good” loss of resistance. This can occur in young adults and women who are in labor. If slightly off the midline, the anesthesia provider may encounter a “soft” feeling. This is because the needle may be in the paraspinous muscle and not firmly in the spinal ligaments.  
  
**Large Subdural Space  
**Block failure may occur if the catheter is inserted into the subdural space or a vessel. Horner’s syndrome, a high spinal, or absence of anesthesia can occur with subdural placement of local anesthetics. This is why it is essential to perform a test dose and slowly dose the epidural.  
  
**Increased Vascularity in the Epidural Space  
**Local anesthetic toxicity can occur if the epidural catheter was inadvertently placed into a vessel. The epidural catheter may also be placed into the subarachnoid space. This is why it is essential to perform a test dose and slowly dose the epidural.  
  
**Septations within the epidural space  
**Septations within the epidural space may cause a barrier to spread of local anesthetic, resulting in “patchy” anesthesia. Additional local anesthetic, with the “spared” areas dependent, will often correct this problem.  
  
**L5, S1, and S2 are large nerve roots  
**Their large size may prevent penetration of local anesthetic. This problem can be corrected by elevating the head of the bed and adding local anesthetic. This position change places these nerve roots in a dependent position, allowing for additional local anesthetic penetration.  
  
**Visceral afferent fibers that travel with the vagus nerve  
**Even a great epidural may not prevent visceral pain. This is due to the visceral afferent fibers that travel with the vagus nerve. Increasing the level of the block may alleviate this. In addition, supplementation of the block with intravenous opioids and sedative medications should be considered.  
  
**Not waiting long enough**  
Allow enough time for the medication to work. The onset of epidural anesthesia is slower than spinal anesthesia.  
  
**Epidural Catheter Inserted Too Far**  
Inserting the epidural catheter too far may result in a unilateral block. During a unilateral block, the tip of the catheter has either exited the epidural space or is off to one side. Pulling the catheter back 1-2 cm and adding local anesthetic with the non-affected side down will generally take care of this problem.
