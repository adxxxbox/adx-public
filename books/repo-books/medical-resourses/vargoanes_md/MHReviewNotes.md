## Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) Review Notes

_Patient can die within 15 minutes_  

Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a rare (usually inherited) disorder of the skeletal muscle. It is triggered in susceptible animals and humans by volatile inhalation agents or the depolarizing muscle relaxant, succinylcholine, given with general anesthesia. MH may develop during anesthesia following induction or 20-30 minutes in the postoperative period.  
  
**MH Triggers**  
**Inhalation agents and depolarizing muscle relaxants  
**Desflurane  
Isoflurane  
Sevoflurane  
Enflurane  
Halothane  
Methoxyflurane  
Succinylcholine  
Also but not anesthesia related: physical exercise and extreme heat-very rare  
Nitrous Oxide is not a trigger  
  
**High incidence areas**  
Wisconsin  
Nebraska  
West Virginia  
Michigan

**Later onset of MH susceptibility from gene mutation**  
About one in 2,000 patients harbor a genetic mutation that makes them susceptible to MH. The ryanodine receptor (RYR1) and the closely associated dihydropyridine receptor (DHP) are mostly affected.

This is one reason why many MH patients have had previous surgeries without complication associated with MH.  
_So not having an MH crisis in a previous surgery does NOT rule out MH susceptibility._  
  
The likelihood that a susceptible patient will develop MH depends upon the specific type of receptor mutation. Most often, the causative mutation affects the ryanodine receptor of skeletal muscle. Over > 22 other causative mutations have been identified.

**Quick recognition and treatment is very important.**  
_Before the approval of Dantrolene for MH, the mortality of a MH was > 70%. Currently, the mortality of acute MH is < 5%.  
  
_**Incidence: literature varies and exact incidence of MH is unknown**  
Clinical incidence: 1 in 10,000 - 50,000  
Surgeries in adults: 1 in about 100,000  
Surgeries in Children: 1 in about 15,000-30,000  
Males > Females  
Children under 19 years account for 45 to 52 percent of reported events.  
  
Occurs less in patients who did NOT receive a previous sedative hypnotic agent before the administration of one of the anesthesia trigger agents

**Pathophysiology and cellular mechanism of MH  
What initially happens within the skeletal muscle cells**  
Sarcoplasmic reticulum stores intracellular calcium. There is an uncontrolled calcium release from the muscles cell’s sarcoplasmic reticulum through the ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) causing:  
A rapid and sustained rise in the muscle cell’s intracellular calcium  
Causes the actin/myosin to continually contract (contracture)  
The mitochondria produces much more cellular energy (ATP) and in the process produces much more heat, consumes more oxygen and produces more carbon dioxide.  
Eventually the cell runs out of oxygen and metabolism becomes anaerobic and large amounts of lactic acid is produced.  
Since anaerobic metabolism is limited, the skeletal cell runs out of energy and breaks down releasing its contents into the central circulation that causes the downstream effects of MH.  
  
Pigs have been an animal model that has led to many discoveries about MH in humans.

**Even with treatment and survival of an initial MH crisis, the individual is at risk for:  
**Life-threatening multiple organ failure  
Myoglobinuric renal failure  
DIC  
Compartment syndrome  
Recurrence within the first 24-36 hours following the episode.  
Death  
  
**Some of the first signs of MH can be mistaken for insufficient anesthesia  
**Tachycardia  
Hypertension  
Tachypnea (if the patient is not paralyzed  
The most sensitive early indicator for MH is an increased ETCO2 that is not responding to increased ventilation with or without a warm and blue exhausted CO2 absorbent canister.

**Initial signs of MH in the operating room**

**Rigidity**: NON-transient after induction with masseter (jaw) muscle rigidity (MMR) or generalized after induction with succinylcholine. This is often overlooked because mild or transient MMR can occur after receiving Sevoflurane and Succinylcholine without any occurrence of MH.  
The peripheral muscle rigidity (contracture) may also occur downstream.  
So assess the most accessible extremity- does it feel rigid?  
  
**Tachycardia and hypertension** (90-130 bpm is common)  
Often overlooked and mistaken for either insufficient anesthesia or Desflurane induced.  
The hypermetabolic state and sympathetic catecholamine surge causes increased temperature, oxygen consumption, and acidosis.  
Bradycardia may eventually follow the tachycardia with heart failure from hyperkalemic heart failure.

**Tachypnea and increased minute ventilation  
**Often overlooked because the patient is paralyzed  
Tachypnea is a compensatory mechanism to the massive increase in PaCO2.  
  
**Increase in ETCO2 (Hypercapnea)  
**_The most sensitive early indicator for MH is an increased ETCO2 not responding to an increased minute ventilation._  
A rise in ETCO2 may be delayed for up to 15 minutes after MMR, but will occur if trigger agents are continued.  
Arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) may exceed 100 mmHg  
  
**CO2 absorbent becomes hot and blue**  
CO2 absorbent has been rapidly used up  
  
**Skin mottling  
**Skin becomes mottled and/or cyanotic.

**Ventricular dysrhythmias  
**From hyperkalemia

**Hyperthermia (may exceed 43C from increased cellular metabolism)  
**Almost always occurs after the MMR.  
The hypermetabolic increases body temperature at a very fast rate of 1°-2° C every five minutes and may exceed 43 C. Sometimes this later symptom is the deciding factor to start treating the MH.

**Cola-colored urine (myoglobinuria)  
**A result of the overall skeletal muscle cell breakdown and the release of the myoglobin from the interior of the muscle cell into central circulation.

**DIC** (will occur if not treated appropriately)Will result in bleeding from multiple sites

**Laboratory findings common with an MH Crises  
In venous or arterial blood gas:  
**Metabolic and Respiratory Acidosis  
Elevated Lactate levels by 10-15 fold  
Hyperkalemia: >6.0mEq/L  
HyperCKemia ( CK) sometimes a late finding-> 20,000 U/L  
Serum myoglobin: > 170mcg/L  
Urine Myoglobin  
Abnormal coagulation tests-may result if MH is left untreated  
Elevated aldolase

**Arterial blood gas:**  
pH: < 7.25  
PaCO2: 60-100mmHg  
BE: < - 8 mEq/L

**What initially happens within the skeletal muscle cells**  
Sarcoplasmic reticulum stores intracellular calcium. There is an uncontrolled calcium release from the muscles cell’s sarcoplasmic reticulum through the ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) causing:  
A rapid and sustained rise in the muscle cell’s intracellular (myoplasmic) calcium  
caused the actin/myosin to continually contract (muscle rigidity).  
This increases HEAT due to the extra work of the muscle cell.  
In the process of mitochondria producing more cellular energy, more oxygen is consumed with more carbon dioxide produced.  
Eventually the cell runs out of oxygen and metabolism becomes anaerobic and large amounts of lactic acid is produced.  
Eventually the cell runs out of energy and the cell breaks down and releases its contents into the central circulation that causes the downstream effects of MH.

The clinical manifestations of MH may vary  
**More on Masseter Muscle Rigidity (MMR) after Induction  
(Why it can be overlooked)  
**_Muscular rigidity, especially in the jaw, is often the first sign of MH._Brief rigidity (< 20-30 seconds) is a normal response to succinylcholine.  
Mild or transient MMR can occur after receiving Sevoflurane and Succinycholine without any occurrence of MH.Generalized rigidity with MMR may not be present with MH.  
  
All patients who develop succinylcholine - induced MMR will experience rhabdomyolysis over the ensuing 24 hours._  
  
Rigidity lasting longer than 1 minute is abnormal. 20-50% of these patients will develop MH within the next hour if they received succinylcholine and the patient’s jaw cannot be opened or the patient has peripheral muscle rigidity._When succinylcholine-induced MMR occurs, elective surgery should be postponed. If the procedure is emergent, the anesthetic may continue with nontrigger agents.  
  
These patients should remain in the hospital and be monitored for signs of rhabdomyolysis such as myoglobinuria and myoglobinemia.  
  
CK levels and electrolytes should be checked every 8 hours until returning to normal.  
  
Patients who experience milder increases in jaw tension should be observed for signs and symptoms of MH for at least 12 hours.

If there is evidence of myoglobinuria, dark cola-colored urine, increase in temperature, pulse rate, and abnormality of acid base balance, the patient should be admitted and observed overnight.

**Hyperthermia (may exceed 43C from increased cellular metabolism)  
**_Almost always occurs after the MMR, hypertension and tachycardia_The millions of skeletal muscle cells’ energetic amount to regain cellular calcium control causes an increased need for ATP (hypermetabolic state) and thus increases body temperature. The patient’s _temperature increases at a very fast rate of 1°-2° C every five minutes and may exceed 43 C. Sometimes this later symptom is the deciding factor to start treating the MH._

**Cola-colored urine (myoglobinuria)**There is an increased permeabity and a wide spread skeletal cellular wall destruction leading to rhabdomyolysis. This leads to myoglobinuria, which results in brown or bloody looking urine. Renal failure may follow.

**Muscle edema to whole body edema  
**This is from the generalized skeletal muscle damage and not an early indicator.

Muscle membrane integrity is compromised leading to hyperkalemia and rhabdomyolysis.

**Genetics  
**Susceptibility to MH is inherited by an autosomal-dominant mode. Siblings, parents and children of a MH-susceptible individual have a 50% chance of inheriting a gene defect for MH, and hence would also be MH susceptible.

Uncles, aunts, nephews and nieces would have a 25% chance of being positive, and in cousins this chance would be further reduced to 12.5%.

Over 80 genetic defects have been associated with MH.  
  
MH is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. It is associated with mutations in two genes: _RYR1_, which encodes the skeletal muscle isoform of the calcium-release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (ryanodine receptor type 1 \[RYR-1\]), and _CACNA1S_, which encodes the alpha subunit of the L-type calcium channel isoform of the sarcolemma (dihydropyridine receptor).

An aberrant termination of RYR-1 activity is found in MH-susceptible persons.

_RYR1_ is located on chromosome 19.  
Mutations in this gene occur in at least 50% of persons with MH and all families of central core disease.

Over 80 genetic defects have been associated with MH.  
  
More than 30 mutations and 1 deletion are associated with a positive CHCT, a clinical MH episode, or both. CHCT is the criterion standard for establishing the diagnosis of MH.

**Conditions associated with susceptibility to MH**  
King-Denborough syndrome  
Central core disease  
Minicore myopathy  
_Despite some older literature out there, Muscular Dystrophies are NOT one of these._

**King-Denborough syndrome (KDS)  
**KDS is a rare condition characterized by a triad of dysmorphic features, malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS), and myopathy. Characteristics include:  
Short stature  
Small jaw  
Pigeon chest  
Kyphoscoliosis  
Musculoskeletal abnormalities  
Mental retardation  
Some may also have central core disease

**Central core disease is characterized by:**  
Central core disease gets its name from disorganized areas called cores, which are found in the center of muscle fibers in many affected individuals.  
This condition causes skeletal muscle weakness that ranges from almost unnoticeable to very severe.This weakness affects the muscles near the center of the body (proximal muscles), particularly muscles in the upper legs and hips.  
  
**Minicore myopathy-also known as multiminicore disease**  
Another skeletal muscle weakness disease that may range from mild to life-threatning. Multiminicore disease gets its name from small, disorganized areas called minicores, which are found in muscle fibers of many affected individuals. These abnormal regions can only be seen under a microscope.

**Muscular dystrophy and MH**  
It was long thought that muscular dystrophy was associated with susceptibility to MH, but that association is being questioned. There have been numerous reports of pediatric patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy or Becker muscular dystrophy who experienced hyperkalemic cardiac arrest after induction with inhalation agents and succinylcholine but did not experience hypermetabolism. In addition, anesthesia-induced rhabdomyolysis (AIR) is seen in patients with muscular dystrophy with no signs of MH.

Although muscular dystrophy is not associated with MH, many anesthesia providers refrain from administering inhalational agents and succinylcholine to patients to avoid AIR and hyperkalemic cardiac arrest.
