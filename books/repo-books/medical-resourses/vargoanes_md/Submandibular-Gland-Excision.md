#### Submandibular (Sub-maxillary) Gland Excision

The submandibular gland is one of three salivary glands. It lies deep under the horizontal portion of the lower jaw and the submandibular ducts enter the mouth under the tongue.  
The most common reason for removal is from an infection causing the tubes that drain saliva become blocked. Blockages usually arise as a result of salivary gland stones.

A 1.5-inch long incision is created just beneath the lower jaw. The gland is then dissected away from the surrounding muscles, vessels, and nerves. The facial artery and Wharton’s duct will be ligated.

**Wharton’s Duct**: Also known as the submandibular or submaxillary duct. It is one of the salivary excretory ducts.  
**Anesthesia:** General/ETT, tape the ETT to the opposite surgical side.   
**Duration:** 45- 90 minutes.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
**Position:** Supine, bed may be rotated 90 degrees. Head will be rotated laterally with the surgical side up. Shoulder roll.  
**Paralysis:** Usually not needed. Sometimes the surgeon may want facial nerve monitoring.  
**EBL:** <50mLs.  
**MAP:** Avoid hypertension to decrease bleeding.  
  
**Possible Nerve Damage:** Facial and/or Lingual nerve.  
**Facial Nerve Damage:**

The facial nerve, which passes under the chin and in close proximity to the submandibular gland, makes the lower lip move. If it is damaged, it can lead to a weakness of the lower lip, resulting in a slightly crooked smile. Weakness of the lower lip may occasionally occur, particularly when the gland is badly inflamed. This weakness is usually temporary, and can last for 6-12 weeks.

**Lingual Nerve Damage**

Numbness of the tongue often occurs when the lingual nerve gets damaged. The nerve, which gives sensation and taste to one half of the tongue, runs close to the duct of the gland. Although rarely injured, the tongue may feel numb immediately after the operation if the lingual nerve was damaged during surgery. This usually goes away, and permanent numbness of the tongue is rare.

**Other possible complications:** 

Wound infection  
Hemorrhage
