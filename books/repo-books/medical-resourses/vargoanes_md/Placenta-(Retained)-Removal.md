### Placenta (Retained) – Removal

**Retained placenta:** When the placenta remains in the uterus for more than 1 hour.  
A retained placenta is often accompanied by heavy bleeding.

The third stage of labor is when the placenta and membranes are delivered.  
The length of the third stage itself is usually 5-15 minutes.  
The absolute time limit for delivery of the placenta, without evidence of significant bleeding is around 30-60 minutes.  
 

**Anesthetic:**   
Epidural, if the catheter is still functional and patient is hemodynamically stable.  
General/ETT for major maternal hemorrhage.  
**Position:** Lithotomy  
**Duration:** Usually 20-30 minutes  
**IV Access:** Consider an additional IV if there major hemorrhage.  
**Recommendations:**  
Low dose Nitroglycerine can be used as an alternative to Terbutaline Sulfate or general anesthesia with halogenated agents for uterine relaxation during the removal of the retained placenta.  
Nitroglycerine can be IV, sublingual or metered dose spray.  
Just watch your patient’s BP.  
  
**More Notes:**  
Following delivery of the baby, the retro-placental myometrium is initially relaxed. It is only when it contracts that the placenta shears away from the placental bed and is detached. This leads to its spontaneous expulsion. Retained placenta occurs when the retro-placental myometrium fails to contract  
 

**The three main causes of a retained placenta are:**  
When the uterus stops contracting, or doesn't contract enough for the placenta to separate from the wall of your uterus. This is called uterine atony.

  
When part or all of the placenta is stuck to the wall of your uterus and doesn't separate. This is called an adherent placenta. In rare cases this happens because the placenta has deeply embedded itself in the wall of the uterus.

  
**Trapped Placenta**  
When the placenta comes away from the uterus, but becomes trapped behind a semi-closed cervix.    
In about one out of every 100 to 200 deliveries, the placenta is "retained" in the uterus and doesn't deliver-even after 30 to 45 minutes. 

It is a significant cause of maternal mortality and morbidity throughout the developing world. It complicates 2% of all deliveries and has a case mortality rate of nearly 10% in rural areas.
