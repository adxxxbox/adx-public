### AKA, or Above the Knee Amputation

(trans-femoral)

**There are two types of amputations:**  
The closed or “flap” amputation  
The open or “Guillotine” amputation

Either way, they both require the same anesthetic plan.

**Concerns:** These patients usually have others issues:  
PVD (possible CAD), HTN, DM and ESRD.  
Extremity ischemia.  
Many patients have poor compliance and still smoke.

Some patients have previously had an initial BKA at a younger age.    
Many of these patients have scaly dry skin, along with non-healing and/or infected sores on their legs or feet.

**Anesthetic:**  
General/ETT. An LMA is more convenient, but it is rarely done because most of these patients have aspiration risks.  
A Regional SAB is rarely done but is a great anesthetic.    
Have a Neosynephrine drip ready because you are treating them like a CAD patient.  
**Duration:** 60-90 minutes  
**Position:** Supine with arms out  
**EBL:** 50-200mL; depends on the surgeon.  
Ortho surgeons tend to use a Tourniquet  
Vascular surgeon tend not to use a tourniquet with just as little EBL.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable. Some of these patients are difficult sticks.  
**If this is a dialysis patient:** 500cc NS on a microdrip IV line.  
 

**Possible Regionals**  
Femoral/Sciatic  
Spinal  
Popliteal/Saphenous  
 

**Amputation Facts**  
90% of patients with BKAs will successfully use a prosthesis post-op. AKAs have only a 25% success rate. 

With amputations for ischemic disease, the level of amputation is chosen based on the blood supply and therefore the best chance for a successful healing process.

Patients with diabetes have 10-fold increased risk for lower extremity amputation compared with those who do not have diabetes.
