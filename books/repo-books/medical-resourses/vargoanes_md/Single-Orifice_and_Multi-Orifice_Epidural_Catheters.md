### Single-Orifice and Multi-Orifice Epidural Catheters

(Literature varies)  
  
**The two most popular designs of epidural catheter tips:  
Open Tip** (single orifice)**Multioriface** \- bullet formed tip with several (usually 3) orifices near the tip-meaning  
catheters have three potential exit paths.  
  
**Disadvantage of Multioriface Catheters  
**There exists the possibility of placement of triple-orifice catheter holes (eyes) into two different body compartments: epiduro-vascular or epiduro-subdural or or epiduro-intrathecal.  
  
**A malpositioned Multioriface Catheter has a higher rate of “False Negative” Test Doses than a Single Orifice Epidural Catheter.  
  
**_It can be difficult to detect a malpositioned multiorifice epidural catheter. For this reason,the incidence for an intravascular insertion is 6–12% of patients.  
  
_**Multioriface Catheters have a higher rate of “False Negative” Test Doses for unintentional vascular insertions because they are less reliable for aspirating blood. This leads to a higher rate of local anesthetic toxicity  
  
**Studies show that the multiorifice catheters are less reliable for aspirating blood, thus having more False Negative test doses when inadvertently inserted intravascularly as when compared to an open tip single orifice catheter.  
  
**Two reasons:  
Zero for Aspiration** The distal tip (orifice) of the catheter may have been inserted within an engorged epidural vein and be up against a vessel wall-occluding aspiration. This would limit aspiration from the tip of the catheter. The lateral eyes being in the epidural space will have no aspiration.  
  
**Test Dose local anesthetic does NOT exit the distal port  
**_An obstructed orifice is not rare and a fluid will travel the flow of less resistance_  
  
The open tip of the multiported catheter may be within and temporarily positioned against an epidural vessel wall during the test dose administration. An occluded or partially occluded distal catheter port will result in less exiting resistance through the proximal (lateral) ports for a local anesthetic. This would lead to a “False Negative” test dose when the proximal ports are within the epidural space.  
Remember that a fluid will flow through the path of less least resistance. This may lead to a “False Negative” test dose  
  
**Remember about Epidural Catheter Migration?  
**Studies already show that a secured epidural catheter can move inward 1-2cm during the period of epidural therapy. This can be disastrous if the tip of the epidural catheter is already positioned within an epidural vein.  
  
**Advantage of Multioriface Catheters** Open Tip (single orifice) epidural catheters have a HIGHER incidence rate of inadequate epidural blocks. Studies show that the Multiorifice Catheters are replaced less than the Open Tip (single orifice) catheters from the results of inadequate epidural blocks.  
  
**Incidence of inadequate epidural blocks  
**Epidural catheters with multiple lateral eyes are reportedly associated with fewer unilateral blocks than are the ones with a single orifice catheter.  
Studies show that the Multiorifice Catheters are replaced less often than the Open Tip (single orifice) catheters as a result of inadequate epidural block.  
  
Literature concerning Single-Orifice and Multiorifice Epidural Catheters varies. There is more negative literature concerning the Multiorifice Epidural Catheters than is the case with single orifice catheters, yet many providers utilize them without complaints.
