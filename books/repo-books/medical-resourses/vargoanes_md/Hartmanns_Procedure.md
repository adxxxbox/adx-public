Hartmann’s Procedure    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Hartmann’s Procedure

A **sigmoid colectomy** with **end colostomy formation.**  
  
_The procedure is named after French surgeon Henri Albert Hartmann, who first described it in 1921 (different from the inventor of Hartmann’s solution despite the same name).  
_  
This procedure is typically performed as an **emergency,** most commonly due to **sigmoid perforation** (e.g., secondary to diverticulitis) or a sigmoid malignancy causing bowel obstruction.  
In Hartmann’s procedure, a **descending colon end colostomy** is formed, and the **residual rectal stump** is **closed.**  
  
**Note:** With colon resections, most surgeons attempt to perform an anastomosis to avoid a colostomy.  
However, the sigmoid is so distal that there is usually insufficient space (remaining distance) for an anastomosis with the rectum, thus having to create a colostomy.

While Hartmann’s procedure can be performed laparoscopically, some surgeons prefer a laparotomy to ensure adequate space to operate and to allow **maximum irrigation** of any intra-abdominal contamination.  
  
_**Indications:**_Where intraoperative conditions contraindicate the completion of an anastomosis resulting in a colostomy.Diverticulosis of the colon  
Peritonitis from diverticular disease  
Bowel obstruction  
Anastomotic complications  
Ischemic colitis  
Left-sided colonic volvulus  
Abdominal trauma  
  
**Pre-op:  
Assess for sepsis and hypovolemia:  
**\- In severe cases, hypovolemia, sepsis, and peritonitis (e.g., purulent or fecal) may result in hemodynamic instability (hypotension), causing organ dysfunction or failure.  
\- Aggressive hydration is warranted if not contraindicated.  
\- Vasopressors via sepsis protocols (low-dose vasopressin and norepinephrine) may be warranted.  
\- Abdominal sepsis is a severe complication and may be diagnosed during pre-, intra-, or postoperative periods.  
  
**Nonurgent (scheduled procedure):  
**These patients are usually euvolemic, not septic, and stable.  
These patients DO NOT require aggressive hydration, especially during laparoscopic procedures.  
Patients are allowed to drink up to 2 hours before the operation.  
**Labs:**  
H/H  
BMP  
  
**Lactate and/or ABG:** When assessment for metabolic acidosis is warranted._**  
Anesthesia: General/ETT  
**_Consider multimodal analgesia.  
TAP block as an adjuvant is becoming more popular for elective abdominal procedures.  
**When this is an ERAS procedure: (Use institutions ERAS protocol)**  
To comply with ERAS recommendations, consider the following: restrict the fluid to < 8 ml/kg/hr IBW; usually, 4-5 ml/kg/hr IBW is sufficient.  
Usually, limit total fluids to < 1,500 mLs.  
**IV access:** If the patient is septic, two 18-gauge IVs (especially if both arms will be tucked)  
**NGT:** May be required pre-induction for obstructed or nauseated patients.  
**Induction:** Usually RSI (when urgent)  
**Position:** Supine (arms tucked if laparoscopic)  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**EBL:** Rarely exceeds 150 ml.  
  
**Possible complications:**  
Aspiration  
Wound Infection  
Bleeding  
Paralytic ileus  
Abdominal sepsis  
Cardiovascular and pulmonary complications  
Postoperative urinary retention  
Abdominal compartment syndrome  
  
Twenty-five percent of the patients undergoing emergency colorectal cancer surgery have postoperative medical complications leading to significant mortality.  
Multi-organ dysfunction is the most common mode of death after emergency colorectal surgery.
