Fast Trach LMA (supraglottic airway device) SAD    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Fast Trach LMA (supraglottic airway device) SAD

\- FastrachTM is the most common LMA airway utilized as a conduit for intubation by anesthesia providers.  
\- It was specifically designed as a guide for blind trachea intubation without moving the head or neck and allows continuous ventilation between intubation attempts.  
\- It comes with a special ET tube with soft tips, which makes it possible to intubate blindly, especially in emergencies.  
  
It also comes with a stabilizing rod to anchor and extend the ET tube when removing the LMA.  
**\- Note:** Fiberoptic intubation is still recommended over a blind intubation with all SADs.

**  
Use K‐Y Jelly® as the lubricant.  
**A water‐soluble lubricant, such as K‐Y Jelly®, should be used.  
Do not use silicone‐based lubricants as they degrade LMA FastrachTM components.  
Lubricants containing Lidocaine are not recommended for use with the device.  
  
Lidocaine can delay the return of the patient’s protective reflexes expected prior to removal of the device, may provoke an allergic reaction, or may affect the surrounding structures, including the vocal cords.  
  
**LMA Fastrach Insertion:**  
Unlike the traditional first-generation LMA, the LMA Fastrach connection port does not extend far outside the patient’s mouth.  
  
Refer to “Fastrach LMA Intubation and Extubation” for details.
