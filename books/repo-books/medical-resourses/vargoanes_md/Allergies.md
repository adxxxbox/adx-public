**Allergy** (it is all about PABA)  
**Esters** local anesthetics are metabolized to PABA or PABA derivatives. PABA antagonizes the action of sulfonamides.  
  
**So what is PABA?  
**PABA is also structurally similar to **methylparaben.  
**PABA (Para-Amino-Benzoic Acid) is a natural chemical found in the vitamin folic acid and also in several foods including grains, eggs, milk, and meat.  
In medicine, it’s used to treat some skin conditions, as well as in some cases of arthritis, infertility in women, anemia, rheumatic fever, systemic lupus erythematosus, and even headaches.  
  
**_Unfortunately, PABA is known to produce skin sensitivity reactions.  
  
_**Most manufacturers have phased out the use of PABA because of its tendency to cause allergic reactions. (PABA), and does not result in cross-allergy to amides.**Amides:** Amides are NOT broken down to PABA and rarely cause an allergic reaction.  
  
Because of these possible hypersensitivity reactions, many manufacturers have reformulated some of their products to eliminate methylparaben.  
  
**Some of these products include** :  
Nesacaine-MPF  
Lidocaine-MPF  
Prilocaine-MPF  
Sensorcaine-MPF  
  
**_Methylparaben was at one point_** included as a **_preservative in dental local anesthetics._** Its main function was to inhibit the growth of bacteria and to help maintain the sterility of the anestheticMethylparaben is chemically very similar to PABA – the metabolic by-product of many ester-type local anesthetics.  
  
**Amide local anesthetics** do not undergo metabolism to PABA, and therefore hypersensitivity to amide local anesthetics is rare.  
  
**Amides include:  
**Lidocaine  
Bupivacaine  
Ropivacaine.  
  
With Amides, use cautiously in patients with known liver dysfunction.  
  
Patients who are allergic to ester local anesthetics should be treated with a preservative-free amide local anesthetic.  
  
**Esters include:**  
Tetracaine  
Chloroprocaine  
Procaine  
  
Degradation products are PABA.  
  
True allergic reaction to either subclass of local anesthetics is rare. When a patient reports that she is allergic to local anesthetics, she may be referring to a reaction from the epinephrine added to the local anesthetics. If a specific local anesthetic allergy is identified, choose a local anesthetic from the other class.
