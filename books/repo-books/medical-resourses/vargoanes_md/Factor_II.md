### Factor II (Prothrombin)

**Other names:** Stable factor and serum prothrombin conversion accelerator (SPCA)  
**Prothrombin** is converted into **thrombin** via the “prothrombinase complex.” The complex exists of: factor X, factor V, phospholipid and Ca.

Some literature does not go into detail and merely mentions factor Xa and cofactor factor Va in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.

When prothrombin is converted to thrombin, it is activated and now called **Factor IIa.**  
**Thrombin** then acts to transform fibrinogen into fibrin, which, in combination with platelets and forms a fibrin **clot.**  
  
**Pathway:** Extrinsic  
**Source:** Liver  
A vitamin K dependent clotting factor affected by warfarin.  
  
**Half-life:** 42-60 hours.  
**Associated genetic disorders:** prothrombin G20210A and thrombophila.  
  
**Factor IIa is “activated” thrombin.**  
  
As shown below, thrombin has many roles. For purposes of this topic, thrombin helps convert fibrinogen to fibrin.

Individuals with prothrombin deficiency have hemorrhagic diatheses.  
Patients may also suffer from dysprothrombinemia or hypoprothrombinemia.  
Female patients may suffer from menorrhagia  
_The gene for thrombin is located on the eleventh chromosome (11p11-q12)._  
  
**More Notes**  
A stable protein with molecular weight of 63,000.  
Has a 70% consumption during clotting.
