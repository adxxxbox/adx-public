**More Notes and Explanations**  
  
MAC of volatile gases decreases up to 28% during pregnancy.  
Epidural vein engorgement reduces the available CSF space, extending the spread of subarachnoid injections.

Mucosal capillary engorgement may be present, consider using a smaller ETT (6.5-7cm).  
Avoid nasal intubations.  
Mallampati scores increase one grade higher in 33% of women after labor.

Almost 50% of airway deaths in GA for Cesarean section were due to pulmonary aspiration.

**EKG Changes**  
The heart is physiologically dilated and displaced in both cephalad and lateral directions. A normal pregnancy ECG may have 15–20° left axis deviation and T waves may be inverted in lateral leads and lead III mimicking left ventricular hypertrophy and other structural disease.

**Weight Gain**  
Weight gain varies from person to person and can be anywhere from 5 pounds to 100 pounds (45 kg).

In America, the doctors recommend a weight gain range is 22 to 35 pounds.

**Hormonal Changes with Pregnancy**

**Progesterone and Estrogens**

Progesterone and estrogens rise continually throughout pregnancy, suppressing the hypothalamic axis and subsequently the menstrual cycle.

Estrogen is mainly produced by the placenta and is associated with fetal well–being.  
B-hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) is increased and also produced by the placenta.  
An increased progesterone production is first due to the corpus luteum and later by the placenta.  
The elevated progesterone functions to relax bronchiolar smooth muscle and contributes to an increase in minute ventilation to 50% greater than non-pregnant levels.

**Prolactin** levels increase due to maternal pituitary gland enlargement by 50%. This mediates a change in the structure of the mammary gland from ductal to lobular-alveolar.  
**Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)** is increased, which leads to increases of calcium uptake in the gut and reabsorption by the kidney.  
**Adrenal hormones -** cortisol and aldosterone also increase.

**Human placental lactogen (hPL)** is produced by the placenta, and stimulates lipolysis and fatty acid metabolism. It conserves blood glucose for use by the fetus. It can also decrease maternal tissue sensitivity to insulin, resulting in gestational diabetes.

**Cardiovascular  
**Blood volume slowly increases by 40-50%.  
This is mainly due to an increase in plasma volume through increased aldosterone.  
This causes an increase in heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output.  
Cardiac output increases by about 50%, mostly during the first trimester.  
The SVR (systemic vascular resistance) is slightly decreased, due to smooth muscle relaxation and overall vasodilation caused by elevated progesterone.  
Diastolic blood pressure decreases between 12–26 weeks, and increases again to pre-pregnancy levels by 36 weeks.

After pregnancy the change in stroke volume is not immediately reversed. Cardiac output rises from 4 to 7 liters in the 2nd trimester.

**Renal**  
Renal blood flow increases by 50% (identical to changes in cardiac output), thus artificially lowering BUN and creatinine.

The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) increases from 100 to 150 ml/min by the second trimester, causing an increased clearance of urea, creatinine, and drugs.

Serum urea and creatinine levels decrease by 40%

The increased GRF exceeds the capacity of reabsorption within the distal tubules, leading to increased urine levels of glucose and protein. This may give a false impression of compromised kidneys.

The upper ‘normal limit of urinary proteins is 300 mg/day. This is double that accepted value of a nonpregnant woman.

**Aldosterone Actions are Enhanced  
**Enhanced aldosterone leads to increased water absorption, causing an increase in the volume of distribution and increased elimination half-life of certain drugs.

Primary renal disease is uncommon with a healthy pregnancy. However, preeclampsia causes deterioration in renal function that warrants careful anesthetic approach with strict management of fluid balance, diabetic control, and adjustment of drug doses and regime.

**Inhalation Agents  
**Studies show that Isoflurane requirements are reduced by 28-30%. It is safe to assume that Sevoflurane and Desflurane may be similar.

**Risk with Spinals and Epidurals  
**Epidural vein engorgement reduces the available CSF space.  
This can exaggerate the spread of a spinal.  
Epidural veins become dilated with increased risk of intravascular injection.

These patients are more prone to “Wet Taps” with epidurals.

**Aortocaval Compression Syndrome|  
**At 20 weeks when the enlarged uterus approaches the level of the umbilicus, the uterus can cause compression of both the inferior vena cava and the descending aorta in the supine position. The combination of these, leads to a reduced venous return and decreased CO.

By 38–40 weeks gestational age, there is a 25–30% decrease in CO when turning from the lateral to the supine position. Unfortunately, the uterus cannot adjust or autoregulate blood flow, when it is compromised. The decreased uterine blood flow reduces placental perfusion and can lead to maternal hypotension and a subsequent fetal acidemia.

**IV starts are easier**

Peripheral vasodilatation (especially the arms) makes it easier to start an IV on these patients (unless they’re obese).

During uterine contractions as much as 500 ml of blood is expelled from the uterus into the maternal circulation.

**Hypercoagulation with Pregnancy**

The hypercoagulable state facilitates clotting at the time of placental separation and prevents bleeding during pregnancy.

There is a 10-fold risk of venous thrombosis and a 25-fold increase in the post-partum period.

All clotting factors except XI and XIII are increased.

Also there is a decrease in natural anticoagulants and fibrinolytic activity.

**Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are becoming popular in pregnancy**  
LMWHs are being used increasingly in the antenatal period. If so, you need to find out when the last dose was before performing a regional. A regional block should not be performed within 12 hours of a prophylactic dose of LMWH.

**Platelets**

Both the platelet production and destruction increases and peaks in the third trimester. The platelet count may be lower but still within normal limits due to hemodilution from an increase in plasma.

**Severe Preeclampsia and Platelets**

With severe preeclampsia, the platelet count can decrease rapidly, increasing the risk of an epidural hematoma.

**O2 Requirements and CO2 Production**

O2 requirements and the production of CO2 increase 60% during pregnancy, to meet the elevated metabolic demands of mother and fetus. The body safely adjusts for these changes.  
There is an increase in tidal volume and thus minute ventilation by up to 45% by the second trimester to meet the above demands

There is a minimal increase in respiratory rate.

The increase in progesterone is the main hormone responsible for the increase in tidal volume and thus minute ventilation. Progesterone decreases the CO2 response threshold of the respiratory center, which enables the mother to blow off the increased CO2 and handle the increased O2 consumption. As mentioned earlier, progesterone functions to relax bronchiolar smooth muscle

**FRC Reduction  
**As the uterus becomes larger, it pushes the diaphragm more cephalad decreasing the functional residual capacity (FRC) by 20% in the upright position and up to 30% in the supine position. This is one reason why preoxygentaion, prior to induction is required to prevent rapid desaturation with the SaO2.

**Liver and Liver Function Tests  
**LFTs are slightly elevated, which is normal.  
Serum proteins are decreased, increasing the potency of certain medications.  
Coagulation factors increase.

Serum albumin - lower

Transaminases (AST and ALT) – lower  
Bilirubin - lower

Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) - increased in the third trimester due to placental production of ALP.

ALP is produced in the bones, kidneys, and small intestine in addition to the liver and placenta. In the parturient, elevated levels could also be caused by HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets).  
**Other Possible Causes of Increased ALP**  
Intrahepatic cholestasis  
Malignancy  
Primary liver or bone disease

**Plasma Cholinesterase and Succinylcholine**  
Plasma Cholinesterase activity starts to decrease at the 10th week of pregnancy.  
A 33% maximal reduction can occur up to the third postpartum day.

This is from a reduced synthesis by the liver combined with hemodilution. Activity has to be reduced by 50% for an increased sensitivity to succinylcholine.

Some literature states that higher dose of succinylcholine should be administered, due to the increased volume of distribution and relative resistance.

At the same time, other literature states that the plasma cholinesterase activity may decrease up to 35%, which may prolong the duration of succinylcholine and a lower dose should be considered.  
Most anesthesia providers’ bolus the full 200 mg of succinylcholine.

**HELLP Syndrome and Succinylcholine**

More than 60% of HELLP Syndrome patients have a decreased level of  
pseudocholinesterase activity. The duration of succinylcholine may be prolonged.

**Aspiration Risks  
**As mentioned earlier, almost 50% of airway deaths in GA for Cesarean section were due to pulmonary aspiration. Due to aggressive aspiration prophylaxis we use today, this value is declining.

**Mendelson’s Syndrome:** Acid aspiration, leading to an inflammatory response of the lung parenchyma causing a chemical pneumonia. This is also declining.

Increased rate of difficult airway and increased risks of aspiration is why regional anesthesia is highly preferred for C-sections.  
The safest and most effective way of aspiration prophylaxis is utilizing regional anesthesia

**Aspiration Prophylaxis Starts at 16 Weeks Gestation**

At 16 weeks gestational age, Pepcid and Bicitra as premdeication should be considered.

Histamine H2-receptor antagonists (Pepcid) in combination with sodium citrate (Bicitra) increase the mean pH and decreases the percentage of patients with a gastric pH <2.5 required to cause a chemical pneumonitis. So this decreases the prevalence of Mendelson’s Syndrome.

**Thyroid Gland  
**The thyroid gland can increase in size by almost 20% during pregnancy, which can affect patients with preexisting goiters.

Increasing levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (Hcg) stimulates thyroid-stimulating receptors (TSH) in the anterior pituitary as the subunits of TSH and HCG are both identical. This leads to a transient hyperthyroidism.

However, most of the cases of true hyperthyroidism in pregnancy are usually only due to Graves' disease.  
**A parturient with thyrotoxicosis is very rare and requires:**  
Careful airway evaluation,  
ECG  
A-line  
Hydration corrections  
Correction of electrolyte and glucose abnormalities  
Avoid sympathetic stimulation.  
These patients are usually admitted to an ICU unit postpartum for monitoring.

**Fetal Insulin vs Maternal Insulin**

Fetal insulin levels are independent of maternal insulin production.  
However, fetal glucose levels are dependent on the maternal glucose levels and the load glucose available for placental transfer.

Poor maternal glucose control can result in macrosomia in the fetus, and neonatal hypoglycemia after delivery.
