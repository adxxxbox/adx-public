Crani-Fluid Balance     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Crani-Fluid Balance

Normal volumes are the goal: neither over- or underhydrated.

Normal saline is the preferred crystalloid.

LR is hypotonic and could cause brain edema.

Keep very careful account of I & O.

   
No one number can tell you if the patient is ahead or behind on fluids. Look at all the data and then decide. Use your clinical skills: Check jugular vein distension, skin turgor, ask the patient if he or she is thirsty all the time, look for diuretics on MAR med records, listen to breath and lung sounds.

Urine output can be replaced cc for cc with NS every hour.

**Colloids**  
Albumin is now the preferred colloid over Hespan due to the risk of bleeding. After 1-2 L of NSS, many of us switch to Albumin.   
   
Level I fluid warmers can cause severe brain edema if fluids are given too fast. Some prefer to limit their use to selected aneurysms.

Mannitol is usually started before skin incision. However, we give it at the surgeon’s request.
