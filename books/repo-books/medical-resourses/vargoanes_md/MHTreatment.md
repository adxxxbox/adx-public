Notify surgeon to halt the procedure ASAP while you discontinue the volatile agents and succinylcholine.Multiple simultaneous tasks are required immediately. The anesthesia provider just can not perform these tasks alone . An entire team needs to be involved. This is why you need to immediately call for anesthesia help and activate your institution’s protocol for treatment of malignant hyperthermia.  
  
**\-Call for help and the MH Cart  
**Among the necessary equipment, the MH cart should have a printed protocol for the recognition and treatment of a MH Crisis in the operating room from the MH Association of the US.  
  
**\-Turn off or triggering agents (volatile agents) and increase flow rate to 15 lpm.  
**_Keeping the highest fresh gas flow rate that is also above the patient’s minute volume effectively creates a non-rebreathing system, so exhaled agent is not reintroduced to the patient.  
_Some literature states to remove the inhalation agent vaporizers to prevent inadvertent use. It is much faster to run a long piece of surgical tape over the vaporizer dials later when extra help arrives.  
  
**\-Transition to TIVA  
**Administering 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine is usually the fastest option and will buy you time while someone else arrives and starts a propofol infusion.  
  
**\-Alert the surgeon and nurses in the room of the impending MH crises.**  
  
**Terminate the procedure**  
The surgeon will decide if the procedure can be terminated or continued. This may not be possible with an urgent (non elective) procedure and the OR team may need to work around the sterile surgical field.  
  
**Hyperventilate the patient  
**Hyperventilate with 100% oxygen with high gas flows of at least 15 liters per minute.  
Most providers manually hyperventilate at first then adjust ventilator settings.  
After you increase the respiratory rate and tidal volume, always make sure the I:E ratio is at least a 1:2 (avoiding an inversed I:E ratio and breath stacking. Use common sense by adjusting the ventilator setting to avoid dangerously high mean airway pressures that may cause a pneumothorax.  
  
**_When HELP arrives-assign the below tasks for simultaneous and efficient treatment and have someone call the MH hotline: 1-800-644-9737 for an expert consultant._**  
  
**The delivery of the MH Cart (**should have everything you need)  
  
Either change out the ventilator or add charcoal filters  
We used to traditionally have someone change out the ventilator. This is no longer necessary when Charcoal Filters are available and utilized.  
  
Mix the Dantrolene (this is the life saver-administer ASAP)**_(Dantrolene works by stopping the release of calcium form the sarcoplasm reticulum)_  
**_Because of the amount of syringes needed per 2.5mg/kg dose, at least 2 providers should be mixing and administering the Dantrolene_

The MH symptoms usually resolve several minutes after the first dose of Dantrolene.  
If the symptoms do not resolve, repeat the doses until the symptoms resolve.  
  
If possible, change out the:  
Patient breathing circuit  
Bag  
Carbon-dioxide absorbent  
Add Charcoal Filter (or change out the ventilator)  
  

**Dantrolene Dose for MH Crisis  
**2.5 mg/kg IV every 5 minutes until symptoms subside.  
May require a total dose up to 30 mg/kg  
Dantrolene vial comes in a lyophilized powder of 20 mg/bottle  
Use a 60 mL syringe and mix with 60 mLs of sterile WATER  
**Remember:** each 60 mL syringe only contains 20 mg of Dantrolene

**RYANODEX® (Concentrated Dantrolene in a single vial)  
**1 vial contains 250 mg of dantrolene sodium (1 vial per patient).  
It is easy to mix and given with one 5 mL syringe and administered with a single injection.  
Only contains 125 mg of Mannitol.

**Methods for cooling the patient if the patient is > 38.5 C  
**_This should be assigned to others while Dantrolene is being mixed and administered_Tell the circulator to turn down the room temperatureUncover the patient as much as possibleInsert OG Tube-gastric lavage with ice water  
Ice packs to neck, groin and axilla  
If the abdomen or thorax is open, the surgeon may elect to fill with sterile ice  
Request chilled IV saline  
Turn off fluid warmer (if you are using one)  
**Stop cooling if the temperature drops to 38-37.5 C** because the patient will continue to cool once after cooling measures are discontinued. Don’t overcool the patient.

**Large Bore IVs  
**Start administering the dantrolene quickly through what IV access you presently have while someone else is starting 1-2 16-18g IVs (antecubital) bilaterally when both arms are accessible.  
  
**Consider Arterial line insertion:** For stat labs and improved monitoring  
ABG  
CMP (electrolytes and BUN/Cr)-mint green vacutainer  
CK - mint green vacutainer  
PT/PTT/INR—light blue vacutainer  
Serum and urine myoglobin- red or gold vacutainer  
DIC panel  
  
**Consider starting a Central Line:** For increased access and to monitor CVP.  
**Note:** 4 doses of regular Dantrolene on just a 70 kg patient is 2 liters of volumes.  
  
**Insert Foley Catheter:** monitor urine output  
**  
Hyperkalemia (**may cause ventricular arrhythmias)**  
Ventricular Dysrhythmias  
****_(K > 5.9 or less with ECG changes) is present, treat with:_**  
  
  
CaCl 10mg/kg (max dose 2,000 mg for life threatening hyperkalemia)  
or  
Ca Gluconate 30 mg/kg (max dose 3,000 mg for life threatening hyperkalemia)  
  
Insulin - Regular (adults): 10 units IV + 1-2 amps D50w  
or  
Insulin Regular (adults) 0.1U/kg (D25 2 mL/kg over 30 minutes)

Check glucose levels hourly

  
**Metabolic Acidosis  
**Sodium bicarbonate 1-2 mEq/kg IV (maximum dose 50 mEq)

**Lasix Dose  
**Furosemide 0.5-1 mg/kg once (maximum dose 20 mg)  
Diurese to >1 ml/kg/hr urine output.

If CK or K+ rise, assume myoglobinuria then start at HCO3 drip at 1 mEq/kg/hr, to alkalinize urine

  
**Ventricular Dysrhythmias  
**Usually secondary to acidosis and hyperkalemiaAvoid calcium channel blockers because they adversely interact with the Dantrolene.

**After the MH episode has been controlled  
**Patient should be sedated  
Monitor core temperature continuously  
Maintain urine out with IV fluids and Diuretics  
  
**Admit to ICU for 24 hour monitoring**  
Continuous core temperature monitoring  
**  
Serial Labs**  
BMP and PT/PTT/INR for 24 hours  
CK levels: because creatinine kinase usually peaks many hours after the MH event. So CK levels should monitored until the peak of the CK is seen and until the CK levels start to decrease.  
Serum and urine myoglobin  
DIC panel  
  
Dantrolene maintenance dose:  
1 mg/kg Q6h x 24 hours and up to 48 hours after the MH event.  
  
**Recrudescent rate 25%**  
MH can reoccur up to 25% of the patients within the first 24 hours of the initial event. So Dantrolene is recommended to protect this reoccurrence.

**Kidney protection:** Myoglobin is toxic to the kidneys.  
Extra NS and NaHCO3 may be necessary to protect the kidneys from myoglobin toxicity.

**After Acute MH Crisis  
**Patients and family will require counseling for MH  
Family is recommended to join the **North American Malignant Hyperthermia Registry.**  
**AMRA Form** (Adverse Metabolic Reaction to Anesthesia)-should be filled out by anesthesia provider involved in the event. It can be filled out anonymously or with the patients consent with patient data. The data is entered onto the North American Malignant Hyperthermia Registry so the data can be used for research etc.  
**MH Testing -** Patients are referred to an MH diagnostic testing center.

Preparation  
  
Remember that after the agent has been delivered to the patient , the patient remains the greatest source of agent in the system. Keeping the highest fresh gas flow rate that is also above the patient’s minute volume effectively creates a non-rebreathing system, so exhaled agent is not reintroduced to the patient.  
  
1\. If possible, change patient breathing circuit.  
  
2\. If possible, change carbon-dioxide absorbent.  
  
Remove all vaporizers from the anesthesia system to prevent their inadvertent use.  
3\. Attach a new patient breathing circuit to the anesthesia breathing system and connect a new breathing bag to the patient Y-piece.  
  
4\. With either oxygen or air, flush the system using mechanical ventilation (700 ml tidal volume, I:E ratio of 1:2, RR of 12, PEEP Off, and fresh gas flow rate of 15 lpm) for the minimum required time specified for the machine to be used. (see table 1) Please note the time needed to prepare an anesthesia delivery system must be based on the slowest gas available on the system. Desflurane has been found to be the slowest gas followed in order by isoflurane and sevoflurane in a recent study of GE Healthcare anesthesia Carestations. (manuscripts submitted for publication)  
  
5\. With the bag-vent switch set to the vent position, remove the patient breathing circuit. Allow the bellows to completely deflate. Replace with a new patient breathing circuit and new carbon dioxide absorbent and canister. Perform the pre-use check out.  
  
6\. Before connecting the breathing circuit to the patient at the beginning of the anesthesia case, activate the O2 flush for 10 seconds Whenever possible, set a total fresh gas flow rate of 15lpm. Keeping the highest fresh gas flow rate that is also above the patient’s minute volume functionally creates a non-rebreathing system and minimizes rebound of residual gas at low fresh gas flows rates.

**Anesthesia system preparation for patients with known susceptibility to Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) Guideline**  
The current understanding of the maximum safe level of exposure to a volatile anesthetic gas for a MH-susceptible patient is ≤ 5 ppm.
