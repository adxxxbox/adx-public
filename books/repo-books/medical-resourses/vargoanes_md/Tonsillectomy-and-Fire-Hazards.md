Tonsillectomy and Fire Hazards   

### Tonsillectomy and Fire Hazards

**Two Causes of an airway fire with a tonsillectomy**

1.  Surgeon burns a hole into the ETT where it encounters oxygen resulting in the fire.
2.  A gas leak around the ETT into the oropharynx and oxygen-enriched atmospheres (OEAs) that support combustion is ignited.

**How to lower fire risk during tonsillectomy**  
Lower the FIO2 to less than 30% without nitrous oxide.

Cuffed ETT are always preferred to prevent gases from leaking around the ETT into the oropharynx.  
  
The surgeon can position a metal tip suction in the oropharynx to evacuate any gases that leak around the endotracheal tube.

There are now surgical applications utilized by surgeons with much less fire risk.

Despite being a fire hazard, the electrocautery method remains the most popular application for tonsillectomies amongst ENT surgeons.

There are several varieties of methods and instrumentation utilized by surgeons for tonsillectomies. New technology is always being introduced today. Either way, always ask the surgeon of the need to lower the patient’s FIO2 because of a fire risk. Safety always comes first.

The “Bovie” (Electrocautery) is a “hot method” and creates a spark. Decrease the FIO2 to 35% immediately after the airway is secured and if the patient can tolerate. Electrocautery produces temperatures between 400o C to 600oC, which both cuts and stops bleeding.

**Coblation - (low fire risk)**  
Many anesthesia providers DO NOT lower the FIO2 with coblation. It is low fire risk because it bathes the field with sterile H2O or NS, thus there is little risk of spark. Many anesthesia providers DO NOT bother lowering the FIO2 with coblation.

**Harmonic scalpel (low fire risk)  
**Many anesthesia providers DO NOT lower the FIO2 with a harmonic scalpal. The Harmonic scalpel uses ultrasonic technology to cut and coagulate tissues at lower temperatures than those associated with electrocautery and lasers.

**Additional Notes**  
Airway fire can occur during tonsillectomy because:

-   Electrocautery can be an ignition source
-   Tonsillar tissue or an ET tube can be the fuel
-   Oxygen and nitrous oxide can be the oxidizer.
-   An oxygen leak around the ET tube during tonsillectomy and petroleum-based lubricants also are fire risks.
