### ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde CholangioPancreatography)

The easiest and less invasive way to get directly into the bile duct is through an ERCP. It is commonly used to diagnose and treat various conditions of the liver, gallbladder, bile ducts and pancreas like bile duct stones or stenosis.  
A long endoscope is used and directed from the mouth to the duodenum. From that point, the GI Doc will identify the papilla of Vater (outlet of the common bile duct) and pass a catheter through it.

The GI doc will inject a contrast and take some pictures via x-ray and look for an obstruction. An open channel in the endoscope also allows other instruments to be passed through it in order to perform biopsies, remove stones, do a sphincterotomy and insert stents.  
**_With the pre-op assessment, check the patient’s cervical ROM from left to right, especially right lateral rotation. The patient’s head will be turned 90 degrees towards their right shoulder when in the prone position. Severe neck damage can be associated with patients of limited ROM._**

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT. Ask the GI doc which side of the mouth to tape the ETT.  
Many GI docs prefer us to tape the ETT on the left side of the patient’s mouth.  
Sometimes a deep MAC case, but that’s extremely rare. Make sure you insert the bite block before the patient goes prone.  
**Position:** Prone with the patient’s head to their right and positioning wedge or pillows to elevate the right side. Arms to the side.  
**Duration:** 30 minutes to 2 hours. Depends how fast the doc can find and get into the bile duct.

**IV Access:** 20 G is acceptable

**Glucagon:** Have available. Remember any opioid can cause a spasm of the Sphincter of Oddi. Morphine causes the most spasms.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Don’t need it. Many of these patients are sick and jaundiced.  
**Neo Drip:** Should be available and plugged into the IV distal port.  
  
**Possible Complications**  
Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) is the most frequent complication, occurring in about 3 to 5 percent of people undergoing ERCP. Many surgeons give an Indomethacin suppository in PACU.  
Infection of the bile ducts (cholangitis) is rare.   
Intestinal Perforation  
Aspiration

**More Notes:**  
Ampulla of Vater is formed by the union of the pancreatic duct and the common bile duct. The ampulla is simply the orifice located at the major duodenal papilla (where the bile is secreted). The sphincter of Oddi is a circular band of muscle that surrounds it.

An ERCP is done using Fluoroscopy, so you need a lead apron. It’s a combined endoscopic and radiologic procedure. The ERCP remains the most common means of treating choledocholithiasis.
