Norcuron duration 2X longer in kids less than 1 year compared to adults because of immature liver

Liver function at birth –functional maturity incomplete

Neonates- conjugation reactions impaired

Longer half life of drugs

Neonates-plasma albumin and other protein levels are lower

So protein bound drugs are increased in circulation (not bound)

Minimal glycogen stores-prone for hypoglycemia (avoid prolonged fasting)

Unable to handle large protein stores-prone to academia
