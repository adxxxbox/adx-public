### Urinary Retention

  
_Daniel D. Moos, CRNA_

Neuraxial blockade effectively blocks sympathetic and parasympathetic control of the bladder at the lumbar and sacral levels.  
  
Urinary retention can occur due to the loss of autonomic bladder control. Detrusor function of the bladder is blocked by local anesthetics. Normal function does not return until sensory function returns to S3.  
  
**Risk factors for prolonged blockade of the detrusor muscle include:  
**The use of long acting local anesthetics.  
Age > 50 years.  
Volume of fluids administered.  
Surgical procedure.  
  
Prolonged blockade of the detrusor muscle may lead to bladder overdistention and urinary retention. This should be taken into consideration if no urinary catheter will be placed.  
  
Neuraxial blockade has little effect on the blood flow to the kidneys.  
  
Autoregulation maintains renal blood flow.  
  
Neuraxial blockade does block sympathetic & parasympathetic control of the bladder at the lumbar and sacral levels.  
  
Result: loss of autonomic bladder control.  
  
When placing neuraxial blockade take this in consideration.  
  
Always insert a foley catheter or straight cath the patient. Monitor the bladder for signs of over distention.  
  
Urinary retention is the result of local anesthetic blockade of S2-S4, which decreases bladder tone and inhibits normal voiding reflexes.  
  
In addition, neuraxial opioids may contribute to urinary retention.  
Urinary retention is more common in elderly males with a history of prostate hypertrophy.  
A urinary catheter should be used for moderate to lengthy procedures.  
Careful assessment in the postoperative period is important to detect urinary retention.  
Prolonged urinary retention may also be a sign of serious neurological injury.
