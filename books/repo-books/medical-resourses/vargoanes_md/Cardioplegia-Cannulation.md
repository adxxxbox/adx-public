### Cardioplegia Cannulation

**Cardioplegia Cannula** (pencil thin with a sharp point)  
  
**Antegrade Cardioplegia Cannulation:** the cannula is placed through the purse string on the anterior aspect of the ascending aorta.  
  
**Retrograde Cardioplegia Cannulation:** directly into the coronary sinus via the right atrial appendage.  
  
Once these are in place, bypass may be initiated. Cardioplegia will not be delivered to arrest the heart until the aorta is cross-clamped.
