# Vancomycin

Glycopeptide  
The most commonly used Glycopeptide  
**Doses:**  
15mg/kg: round to the nearest 250mg  
Standard dose:1 gram  
Give over 60 minutes (no faster than 10mg/min)  
**Peds:**  
\>1 month and children:40-60mg/kg/day IV in  
divided doses Q6-8h  
Max: 2 grams/day  
**Caution:**  
Rapid infusion < 30 minutes can cause a profound hypotension and even cardiac arrest from a histamine release (from cutaneous mast cells) we know as "Red Man Syndrome."This is characterized by Intense truncal and facial erythema.  
It can sustain plasma concentrations up to 12 hours  
**MOA**  
Prevent synthesis of the bacteria cell wall.  
**Indications**  
Severe Staph  
Strept or enterococcal endocarditis in patients who are allergic to cephalosporins.  
Drug of choice for MRSA  
**Side Effects**  
Hypotension (venodilation) from a histamine release  
**Other Notes**  
They are very large in structure and cannot pass through the outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria. So they are restricted to gram-positive organisms.  
Very potent against MRSA  
Serum drug levels are often monitored to limit toxicity.  
Peak levels should be below 40mg/L to reduce the risk of ototoxicity (hearing loss to high frequency sounds).  
Trough levels: should be > 5mg/L to maintain antibacterial activity.
