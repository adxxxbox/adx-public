### Hearing Test (BAER)

  
_By Justin Flesher, CRNA, Charlotte, NC  
  
_The hearing test known as the brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER), or brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP), detects electrical activity in the cochlea and auditory pathways in the brain.  
This is a simple hearing test usually performed on kids and sometimes pets.  
  
Electrodes are placed on the patient's scalp and on each earlobe.  
A brief click or tone will be transmitted through small sound probes (function the same as earphones) positioned in the patient's ear during the test.  
The electrodes pick up the brain's responses to these sounds and record them.  
  
**Indications:** Helps diagnose nervous system problems and hearing loss (especially in newborns and children). Common for infants who are experiencing speech delays and the parents become concerned they might have hearing issues.  
**Short summary of the surgical procedure** : This non-painful procedure is performed by an audiologist. Anesthesia is requested for patients who may not be able to remain motionless, such as very young infants and special needs children.  
MAC sedation is standard.  
  
**Short summary describing the anesthesia:** Very simple exam with no real stimulation.  
**  
These cases can be done two ways:  
**LMA or room air general (propofol infusion) like a pediatric Endo case.  
**  
Pre-op and Preparation:  
**Appropriate sized LMAs and oral airways.  
  
Comorbidities or syndromes are common.  
The child will mostly likely require oral midazolam. Narcotics are not necessary.  
**Anesthetic:** Mask induction, IV, and then LMA placement.  
Also a Propofol infusion with nasal cannula is popular.**Airway issues:** Usually none unless associated with a syndrome**Regional:** Not needed  
**Nitrous:** Avoid**Muscle Relaxation:** Not needed**Position** : Supine  
**Duration:** Up to 1 hour  
**EBL:** None  
**IV Access:** 22-24 gauge is acceptable**A-line:** No**Age Range:** Newborn to adolescent**Foley Catheter:** No**  
  
Hydration:  
**Recall the 4:2:1 ratio.  
LR OR NS**  
(Below is just a common reference):**  
Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc/kg)  
**EBV(reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg**Emergence:** I prefer to remove the LMA deep and take to PACU with an oral airway.  
I administer zofran at the end.**Possible Complications:** None**Quick Basic Drug References  
Propofol:** 2.5-3.5mg/kg IV  
**SCh** (<1 year: 3mg/kg) (>1 year: 0.1mg/kg)  
**Neostigmine:** 0.05-0.07mg/kg  
**Robinul:** 0.01mg/kg  
**Fentanyl:** 1-2mcg/kg  
**Morphine:** 0.7-1.4mg/kg**Ofirmev:** (>2 years: 15mg/kg)  
**Not FDA approved for < 2 years, but many still administer at 15mg/kg  
Toradol:** (>2 years: 0.5mg/kg)  
**Precedex** (Emergence) **:** Slow push 0.5mcg/kg  
**Zofran:** 100mcg/kg (max 4mg)  
**Decadron:** 0.2-0.5mg/kg  
**Ancef:** 25mg/kg  
**Ampicillin:** 25-100mg/kg (max per day 100-400mg/kg)  
**Gentamycin:** 2.5mg/kg  
**Ceftriaxone (rocephin):** 50-75mg/kg  
**Clindamycin (cleocin):** 15-25mg/kg  
**Invanz** (ertapenem): (3 month -12 years): 15mg/kg  
**Vancomycin:** 10mg/kg
