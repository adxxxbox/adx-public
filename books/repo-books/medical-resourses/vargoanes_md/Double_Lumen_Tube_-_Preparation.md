## Double Lumen Tube - Preparation

_Daniel Perez, CRNA, Kaiser, Orange County California_

**Prior to insertion of any DLT, perform a detailed airway examination:**  
Review films and images of the neck and thorax  
Review pulmonary function test (if available)  
**Note:** Patients with severe restrictive lung disease and a very poor diffused lung carbon monoxide (DLCO) generally do not tolerate One Lung Ventilation (OLV). See summary.

**  
Summary of predicted postoperative complications:**  
Average risk:  

-   FEV1 >2L or 80% (stated by patient)
-   DLCO >40%
-   VO2 max > 15ml/kg/min
-   Ability to climb 3 flights of stairs

Elevated risk:  

-   FEV1 <2L or < 40%
-   DLCO <40%
-   VO2 max < 10ml/kg/min
-   Inability to climb 1 flights of stairs
-   Oxygen desaturation >4% during exercise

**Equipment that should be present with DLT intubation**  
Different sized laryngoscope blades  
Difficult airway cart with Fiberoptic scope -used to confirm proper positioning  
**Note:** Keep the fiberoptic scope in the room during surgery because tube placement can change during positioning, lung manipulation and so forth.

Consider having an indirect video laryngoscope, tube exchanger, or bougie if available.

**Difficult Airway (suspected or unsuspected)**  
It may be better to place a single lumen tube (regular ETT) and isolate the lung with a bronchial blocker.  
However, when a DLT is necessary, a single lumen tube can be placed and a tube exchanger can then be used to switch to a DLT.

**Robert-Shaw DLT**  
Most commonly used DLT  
Available in sizes 35, 37, 39, and 41F.

**Choose the largest DLT that will fit**  
Some studies recommend choosing the largest tube that will fit in order to decrease the chance of migration and obstruction, which can result in hypoxemia, lung isolation failure, increased airway resistance, difficulty of passing a fiberoptic scope, or tracheal obstruction.

However, others propose inserting a smaller than conventional size to decrease trauma with insertion.

**Common DLT Sizes per Gender**  
Most male adults take a size 37F or 39F  
Most female adults take a size 35F or 37F

**Patient Height**                              **Tube Size**       **Depth of Insertion**

53.5-64.5 inches (4’5” – 5’4” ft)           37F                     27 cm  
64.5-70.5 inches (5’4” – 5’9” ft)           39F                     29 cm  
70.5-76.4 inches (5’9” – 6’4” ft)           41F                     31 cm

**Left-sided DLTs are used for most cases that require lung isolation and OLV**  
If a left pneumonectomy is planned, the left DLT can be withdrawn back to the trachea before the surgeon staples the bronchus.  
Right-sided double lumen tube placement is more challenging because of the early branching of the right upper lobe.

**Left DLT vs Right:**  
When retrieving a DLT for your procedure, always choose a left DLT unless contraindicated.  
Left-sided DLTs are used more frequently as they are significantly easier to place without obstructing the upper lobe bronchus.  
A right DLT includes an orifice along the bronchial tube to align with and ventilate the RUL.
