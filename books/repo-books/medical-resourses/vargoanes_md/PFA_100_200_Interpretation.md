| --- | --- |
| COL/EPI | ≤ 180 seconds |
| COL/ADP | ≤ 110 seconds |
| INNOVANCE PFA P2Y | ≤ 106 seconds |

_Literature varies with normal values_

**Normal Col/Epi closure time (<180 seconds)  
**Excludes the presence of a significant platelet function defect.  
A COL/ADP test will not be run.  
  
**Prolonged COL/EPI (> 180 seconds) and Prolonged COL/ADP (> 110 seconds)  
**Anemia (hematocrit < 28%)  
Thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100 x 109/L)  
A significant platelet function defect other than aspirin  
  
**If anemia and thrombocytopenia have been excluded (from above)  
Further evaluation is needed to exclude:** von Willebrand disease and inherited/acquired platelet dysfunctions such as renal failure storage pool disease, release defect, Bernard-Soulier disease, and Glanzmann thromboasthenia should be considered.  
  
**Normal COL/ADP (≤ 110 seconds) and prolonged COL/EPI (> 180 seconds)  
**Platelet dysfunction most likely from ASA  
(Long-term aspirin therapy may modestly prolong the Col/ADP)  
  
**Normal INNOVANCE PFA P2Y in a patient treated with P2Y12 receptor blocking agent  
**Low treatment response is likely  
  
**How PFA-100/200 Assay specimen requirements  
**2 4.5 mL light blue-top citrate tubes.  
DO NOT refrigerate or pass through pneumatic tube system  
Hand deliver tubes  
  
**Result Time  
**An organized hospital laboratory: < 60 minutes
