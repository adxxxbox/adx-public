### Clevidipine (Cleviprex)

For continuous infusion.  
**Class:** Calcium-channel-blockers: dihydropyridine.  
**Solution concentration:** 0.5mg/mL  
  
**Character:** Similar in appearance to propofol, milky white injectable emulsion.  
Contains 0.2 grams of lipids per mL.  
Because of lipid load restrictions, no more than 1,000 mL or an average of 21 mg/hour of Cleviprex infusion is recommended per 24-hour period.  
  
**Mechanism of action:** Blockade of the dihydropyridine L-type calcium channels, found primarily on the arterial rather than venous system. Researchers noted no change in central venous pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, or cardiac index with increasing doses.  
**Decreases SVR**  
  
**Half-life:** 1 minute  
  
**Indications:** Reduction of BP when oral therapy is not feasible or desirable.  
**Dosing:** (Clevidipine concentration is 0.5 mg/mL)**Initial:** Start at 1-2 mg/hr (2-4 ml/hr). Dose may be doubled every 90 seconds as blood pressure approaches goal. As BP approaches the desired value, dose increases should be less than double and time between dose adjustments should be 5-10 minutes. Rapid large increases may result in reflex tachycardia.  
  
**Maintenance:** 4-6 mg/hr for most patients not to exceed 21 mg/hr (1000 ml within 24 hour period).  
  
**Most popular maintenance dose:** 16mg/hour (32ml/hour).  
  
**Dosing for severe hypertension**  
Up to 32mg/hour (Limited short term experience)

**Clevidipine and pheochromocytoma: documented doses**  
Infusion at 4 mg/hr initiated immediately after induction with hypertension, later titrated to effect.  
**Acute hypertension:** 1 mg (2ml) boluses as needed. BP decreases within 90 seconds.  
Clevidipine dose‐related tachycardia was managed by intermittent boluses of Esmolol.  
Attaallah, A. F.; Lindstrom, E; 2012.  
  
**Renal impairment:** Dose adjustment not necessary.  
**Hepatic impairment:** Dose adjustment not necessary.  
**Elimination:** Rapid  
  
**Metabolism:** By the blood and tissue esterases independent of liver and kidney function.  
Has little to no risk of cytochrome P450-associated drug toxicity.  
Metabolized to inactive metabolites with a mean blood clearance rate of 0.121. l/min per kg.  
  
**Protein bound:** Up to 99.7%.  
  
**Heart rate increase:**  
Clevidipine does result in a modest increase in heart rate from baseline, as has been shown with other IV calcium channel blockers. Heart rate increases within the first 30 minutes of administration, but this appears to return to baseline.  
  
**Pregnancy Category:**  
**C:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.  
Animal studies show risk and human studies not available or neither animal nor human studies done.  
  
**Lactation:** Not known if excreted into breast milk, do not nurse.  
  
**Possible complications  
**Hypotension and reflex tachycardia from rapid dose increases; decrease rapidity of increase in dose.  
  
Rebound hypertension when the drug is discontinued without transitioning to another antihypertension agent. It is therefore advised that patients be observed for 8 hours after the infusion is discontinued.

**More Notes**  
Clevidipine is a new third-generation IV dihydropyridine CCB that was approved by the FDA in 2008 for treatment of severe hypertension. It reduces BP without affecting cardiac filling pressures or causing reflex tachycardia.  
  
**Advantages**  
Fast onset and offset (ultra-short half-life of <1 minute).  
Ease of titration.  
Small volume of distribution.  
Fast elimination independent on hepatic and renal clearance.  
  
It is an arterial selective vasodilator that reduces peripheral vascular resistance directly without causing venous capacitance dilation.  
BP reductions occur within 6 to 10 minutes. BP and heart rate return to baseline within 10 to 15 minutes after discontinuation of the drug.  
  
**Acute hypertension:** 1mg bolus may decrease BP within 90 seconds.
