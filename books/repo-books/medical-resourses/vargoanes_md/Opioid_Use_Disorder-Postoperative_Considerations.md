### Opioid Use Disorder-Postoperative Considerations

**Opioid Rotation** (Utilizing the calculations presented in the preoperative section)

-   Opioids are typically classified by three main chemical structures:
-   **Phenanthrene:**  morphine, codeine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, oxymorphone
-   **Phenylpiperdine:**  meperidine, fentanyl, alfentanil, remifentanil, sufentanil
-   **Diphenylheptane:**  propoxyphene, methadone
-   Rotation of opioids between these chemical classes balances pain relief with opioid dose reduction since there is a high extent of cross-tolerance within the same class
-   Allows for a 50% opioid reduction in opioid equivalents to prevent incomplete opioid cross-tolerance, followed by an additional 20-30% reduction target at discharge

**Micro-dosing IV buprenorphine to attempt to wean opioid dependence** **postoperatively:**

-   Low-dose approach slowly initiated buprenorphine over four days while tapering methadone or full agonist opioids without precipitating withdrawal

**Opiate Withdrawal Scales:**

-   Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS)
-   Rates feelings of restlessness, anxiousness, nauseousness, and other physical symptoms on a scale of 0-4
-   Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS)
-   Scores clinical signs of withdrawal, such as pulse rate, sweating, pupil size, tremor, etc., on a scale of 0-4
-   Modalities to treat opioid withdrawal symptoms
-   Anxiety/restlessness: alpha-2 adrenergic agonists
-   Insomnia: trazodone, melatonin, hydroxyzine
-   Musculoskeletal pain: acetaminophen, ibuprofen
-   GI distress: oral hydration, electrolyte replacement, Hycosamine, ondansetron, loperamide

**Lofexidine** **(Lusemyra):**  
**Dose:** Three 0.18 mg tablets  
Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists remain important agents for the treatment of opioid withdrawal with comparable efficacy to tapered schedules using opioid agonist and partial agonist medications.
