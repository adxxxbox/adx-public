### Hidradentitis-Excision

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory cutaneous disorder that involves the infundibular terminal follicles in areas rich of apocrine glands. It can be associated with a fistulating sinus, scarring and abscess formation. It can occur in one or multiple areas of the body. HS usually develops in the armpits, groin, and anal area. It causes long-term skin inflammation and can be painful.

The surgeon simply excises the area of skin and the layer of tissue that the glands are within. Most of the time there is enough skin to close. Sometimes a graft may be needed to close.

**Anesthetic:** General/LMA, sometimes ETT  
**Duration**: 45-90 minutes  
**Position:** Depends on surgical site  
**Axillary Area:** Supine with arms out. Bed may be elevated and tilted for the surgeon. Make sure the EKG leads are out of the way. Sometimes large breasts need to be taped medially. If it is a bilateral, consider placing the BP cuff on a forearm or leg.

**Perineal/Gluteal or rectal:** Lithotomy

**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable  
**EBL:** 20-40mLs  
**Possible Complications:**  
Infection  
Reoccurrence  
Flap failure

**More Notes**  
Symptoms of HS  
Blackheads and red tender bumps get bigger, break open, and leak pus.  
Tunnels that form under the skin between abscesses  
Scarring  
No one knows what causes HS. It is more common in women, African Americans, and people who have had a lot of acne. It usually starts after the teenage years. Treatments include antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medicines, and sometimes surgery. Losing weight and wearing loose clothing can also help.
