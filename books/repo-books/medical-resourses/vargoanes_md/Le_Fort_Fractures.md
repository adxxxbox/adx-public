### Le Fort Fractures

**Le Fort I:** (below the nose) A horizontal fracture above the teeth and palate, separating

the palate and maxilla.

**Le Fort II**: (across the nose and descending down) This type of fracture crosses the nasal

bones, lacrimal bones and medial and inferior orbital rims. The maxilla separates from

the face. This fracture extends posteriorly to the base of the skull.

**Le Fort III:** (Across the nose but the fracture does not descend down)

A Supra-zygomatic fracture, extending up along the superior and lateral orbital wall(s).

This type of fracture is associated with the highest rate of CSF leakage. **_Attempting to intubate nasally could penetrate brain tissue._**

For any and all nasal, zygomatic or orbital fractures: Attempting nasal intubation can

violate the cranial vault.
