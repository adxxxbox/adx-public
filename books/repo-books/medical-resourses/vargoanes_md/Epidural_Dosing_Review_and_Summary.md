### Epidural Dosing Review and Summary

**_Dr. Alyson Eastep, CRNA Summerton, SC_**  
  
**_Note:_** _There are hundreds of different epidural admixtures intended for the same goal.  
**Goal:** Adequate analgesia while preserving pushing power (motor function) for vaginal delivery._  
  
**Always remember:** epidurals are volume blocks_The major determinant for an epidural level is the volume administered.  
The major determinant for depth of an epidural block is the drug dose (concentration)._  
  
The blood concentration of a local anesthetic is proportional to the total dose of local anesthetic.  
Keep in mind the total doses of all local anesthetics administered  
Higher blood concentrations are produced by large volumes of dilute local anesthetic compared to the same dose in a smaller volume. (e.g. 400 mg of lidocaine in 40 ml will result in higher blood concentrations than 400 mg of lidocaine in 20 ml.)  
  
**The higher the concentration, the more motor blockade (more dense)  
Example:** _Increasing the concentration of the local anesthetic, while keeping the volume constant, increases the extent of the block. Concentration will result in a denser motor block. This is to be avoided during labor._  
  
**After the epidural is inserted:  
**Proper placement is confirmed with a “Test Dose.”  
  
**Test Dose:  
**Typically a test dose consists of 3ml of 1.5% Lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  
1:200,000 epinephrine contains 5mcg/mL**  
  
Some epidural kits have a premixed Test Dose ampule 5ml mixture of:**  
1.5 % preservative-free Lidocaine mixed with 1:200,000 epinephrine (5 mcg/ml) in a vial.  
Draw up 3cc test dose (from that 5cc ampule) in a 10cc syringe using a filter straw. Administering 3cc from that ampule is the most common test dose (45mg Lidocaine with  
1: 200,000 epinephrine) administered in the US.  
  
**After a negative test dose, administer the therapeutic dose  
**_There are hundreds of different combinations of local anesthetics and opioids for epidural therapeutic doses.  
  
_After a negative test dose, some providers administer a bolus dose in 5 mL increments (x2) at least 3 minutes apart. Many anesthesia providers also consider these “test doses” because you are assessing the effect of each 5cc bolus on the patient.  
**  
In what position are parturients usually placed for these doses?**  
Inject the first 5ml while the patient is sitting. Then secure the catheter and position the patient supine. Once supine, assess how their contractions are feeling and assess whether the abdomen is numb. That should NOT be the case after only a 5 ml bolus. If the parturient can still feel contractions and pain, administer the second 5 ml while the patient is still supine.  
  
**When is the catheter secured with tape - after the first 5 ml dose or after the initial test dose?**  
If the test dose is negative, place sterile moisture vapor permeable (Tegaderm) dressing over the site. Next, attach the bolus syringe and give the first 5 ml dose. Then tape catheter to the patient’s back. Apply tape across the Tegaderm horizontally several times, then tape vertically up the back and have the catheter dangling over the shoulder for easy access. I then position the patient supine with left uterine displacement. By this time it has been several minutes since the first bolus and the remainder of the 2 nd bolus (5cc) is given while the patient is supine  
  
**Onset of Action  
**The onset of epidural block with all local anesthetics can usually be detected within 5 minutes in the dermatomes immediately surrounding the injection site.  
  
**The time to peak effect differs between local anesthetics:**  
Shorter-acting local anesthetics: Max spread in 15-20 minutes  
Longer-acting local anesthetics: Require 20-25 minutes.  
Increasing the dose of local anesthetic speeds the onset of both motor and sensory block.  
  
**What is being assessed for dermatomal levels? Pain?**  
Assess the patient’s pain with contractions. A formal check of dermatomal level with pin prick or the cold and wetness test of alcohol is not necessary, but ensure they are STILL FEELING some contractions and pain. The patient should still be able to wiggle her toes.  
**Remember:**  
The sensory level achieved by a block is assessed with a pinprick.The level of sympathectomy is assessed by measuring skin temperature.  
**  
What sensory or pain loss is initially sought?**  
First, the parturient will report that her legs feel warm and tingly as though they are falling asleep – that is normal. She will still feel her contraction pain until I finish giving the 2 nd 5cc bolus. About 15 minutes after the last of the bolus dose is administered, charting has usually been completed and she should be completely comfortable from a total of 10 ml administered.  
  
Sensory level of cold sensation is usually tested by touching an alcohol swab to an unaffected are of the body so the patient can compare that to testing on blocked dermatomes. The level at which they no longer feel cold and wet is the sensory level achieved: T10 (umbilical) level is optimal; a level up to T8 is acceptable.Return and visit the patient to make sure they are comfortable and that maternal vital signs are stable and fetal well-being maintained.  
  
Some literature states to administer the local anesthetic only **3 to 5 ml** at a time. The signs and symptoms of intravascular injection should be closely monitored despite a prior negative test dose.  
Most anesthesia providers currently administer 5 ml at a time.  
**  
Vital Sign Assessments  
**Maternal heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and FHR should be measured at 5 minute intervals for the first 15 min then half hourly.  
Assess and record the sensory level of the block hourly  
Remain available for review of the partituent and to manage any complications for at least 20 minutes after the initial dose.  
  
**Bupivacaine and Ropivacaine are the two most popular local anesthetics for an OB epidural**  
Both have slower onset and prolonged duration.  
However, ropivacaine is more popular than bupivacaine because it is less cardiodepressant and arrhythmogenic, conferring a greater margin of safety in the event of unintentional intravenous injection. Parenteral lipids should always be readily available in the event of intravascular injection as this is the only successful treatment of local anesthetic systemic toxicity.  
  
**Safety Points regarding Ropivacaine**  
Ropivacaine is a less toxic drug than bupivacaine.  
A 20 mg dose in a laboring patient is less than 0.33 mg/kg.  
This is a very safe and effective dose of local anesthetic.  
If 20 mg of ropivacaine was administered accidentally intravenously, it would be safer than bupivacaine, and, depending on the rate of injection, may NOT cause any symptoms. If a dose were accidentally given intrathecally, it is still an acceptable dose for spinal ropivacaine.  
(Anesth Analg 2003;96:1473).  
  
For a vaginal delivery, the parturient is usually completely comfortable from two 5 ml boluses (10 ml) of 0.2% ropivacaine followed by a PCEA rate of 10 ml per hour to cover to a T10 level.  
For C-section a higher level up to T4-6 is required. For this reason, an increased volume (20 ml) is usually the maximum.  
If the parturient already has a good sensory level from the labor epidural and you give 10ml of lidocaine in 5 ml increments that will usually reach a T4-6 level.  
  
**Other Notes  
**Tetracaine and procaine are not used because of their long latency times.  
  
**The most common 8-10 ml doses of local anesthetics are:**  
8-10 ml of 0.125% PF Bupivacaine and 1-2 cc of narcotic (fentanyl is common)  
8-10 ml of 0.2% Ropivacaine and 1-2 cc of a narcotic (fentanyl is common)  
As labor pain spreads to the perineum and delivery approaches, epidural volumes should be increased to cover the perineum. This is the reason top offs are given and why the patient has a bolus button on her PCEA pump.  
  
**PCEA Settings (many acceptable settings exist)  
**After administering 5cc x 2 or 1 10cc of a mixtures of local anesthetic and an additive of choice, connect the patient to a PCEA (patient-controlled epidural analgesia).  
Some providers add small dose of narcotics in their mixture – usually fentanyl. Some avoid narcotics after the initial bolus to avoid potential side effects.  
There are many possible settings and cocktail mixtures for the PCEA.  
  
**Epidural Bag Mixtures for PCEA  
**There are many different PCEA bag mixtures between institutions and are tailored per the anesthesia department requests. They are mixed by the pharmacy debt. It is almost always a mixture with a LA and diluted narcotic.  
  
**Below are 2 examples:**  
0.2 % ropivacaine with fentanyl 2 mcg/ml  
0.125% bupivicaine with fentanyl 2 mcg/ml  
  
**Below is an example of a PCEA setting:  
**20ml epidural mix dose can be repeated at hourly intervals**  
0.2 % Ropivacaine  
**Basal infusion rate: 10 ml  
Bolus dose: 5 ml  
Lockout interval: 15 minutes  
Maximum hourly dose: 25 ml  
  
**Top Off:  
**_There are also a variety of Top Off doses among anesthesia providers  
_The term “Top Off” refers to the patient experiencing more pain and requiring additional analgesia. This is usually in the later phase of active labor and close to full cervical dilation.  
**  
Care must be exercised when administering a “Top Off”  
**_The patient to should still feel pressure and be able to push for delivery._The increase in pain is usually from the afferent nerves innervating the cervix, perineum and vagina via the pudendal nerve at the S2-S4 dermatomes.  
The progress of dilatation should be assessed.If the parturient is fully dilated and ready to deliver, a 5 cc bolus of the same local anesthetic is common.If the parturient is not ready to deliver, 8-10 ml of the same local anesthetic is common.  
  
**Why is etidocaine not used in OB?**  
Using etidocaine it is nearly impossible to produce adequate analgesia without significant motor blockade. The mother will not be able to push. Etidocaine is great for orthopedics, however.
