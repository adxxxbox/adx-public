### Spinal Surgeries for Deformities

(360° Fusion Anterior or lateral and Posterior)  
For scoliosis and other deformities

2 separate long procedures  
  
**Why this procedure is challenging**  
Large intraoperative blood loss  
Careful fluid resuscitation  
Maintaining adequate anesthesia via TIVA  
Long surgical times  
Postoperative pain control  
  
For Thoracic, sometimes a double lumen tube and the lung collapsed on the upper side.  
For thoracic spine surgery, a decrease cord perfusion can result in significant cord injury, and maintaining BP as well as the surgeon avoiding physical pressure on the cord may result in much better outcomes.

Deformity surgeries are more challenging than the conventional spinal fusion. Congenital deformities are often associated with neurologic abnormalities, such as tethered cord or diastematomyelia. Even small changes in spinal alignment may stress the cord and cause neurologic deficits. This is why electrophysiologic monitoring is necessary.

The 360 Surgery is done in 2 stages (2 Surgeries)

First Surgery is the **Anterior or Lateral Approach**

Second Surgery is **Posterior Approach** (same day or a few weeks after the first surgery)

**First Part**

**Anterior or Lateral Approach**  
If it’s an anterior approach, a general surgeon is needed to expose and access the spinal region for the neurosurgeon.  
Lateral approach **–**general surgeon not needed.

For L5-S1, the hip obstructs the surgeon in the lateral position, so the anterior approach is needed.  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
**Neuromonitoring:** Usually, check with the monitor tech. You may be requested half MAC or TIVA. Ketamine is a popular adjunct.  
**Position:** Lateral or supine  
**Cell Saver:** Sometimes  
**IV Access:** 2 18g  
**A-line:**  Yes  
**Neo drip:** Yes  
**Type and Cross:** Yes  
**BIS Monitor:** If half MAC or TIVA  
**EBL:**  50-250mLs. Not as much as the Posterior approach  
**Warming Blanket:** Lower body  
**Posterior Approach** (Same set up as first part)

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT (sometmes TIVA)  
Ketamine is a popular adjunct.  
**Position:** Prone  
**Cell Saver:** Sometimes  
**IV Access:** 2 18g  
**A-line:**  Yes  
**Central line and Cordis**: Sometimes  
**Type and Cross**: Yes and have PRBCs and FFP on standby  
**BIS Monitor:** Yes

**Warming blanket:** Upper and lower. These patients are prone to hypothermia.  
**Fluid warmer:** Yes  
**EBL:** 500mLs -2 liters   
The surgeon may request Amicar or Tranaxemic Acid to help reduce blood loss.  
**Amicar:** 5 gram bolus followed by 1 gram an hour.  
(5grams/100mL bag at 20cc/hr), doses vary per literature.  
**Tranaxamic Acid:** 10mg/kg followed by 1mg/kg/hr. 1 gram is a common dose.

**Possible Complications**  
Excessive blood loss  
If L5-S1 level, in Males-retrograde ejaculation (superior hypogastic plexus) Ileus  
Neurological Myelopathy  
Lymphocele (chyloretroperitoneum)  
Incisional hernia (this may require corrective surgery)  
DVD  
Slipped bone graft  
Instrument failure

**More Notes**

**PFTs**

Lonner et al.showed there is a significant decrease in the patient’s vital capacity and Peak Flows as compared to a basic posterior procedure at 3-5 weeks post-operatively.

Acute lung injuries are common-up to 15% after spinal deformity correction surgeries.

360° Fusion Anterior or lateral and Posterior is much easier for us if it is just your basic ALIF/PLIF. Following the ALIF, the patient immediately gently rolled prone for the PLIF. To correct spinal deformities, the two procedures are much longer in duration, tend to lose more blood and the first and second part is usually scheduled a few days apart.
