### Bowel Obstruction Notes and Facts

Most of these cases are urgent.  
  
**Possible symptoms of Obstruction:**  
Malnourished, dehydrated, septic shock, decreased LOC and increased abdominal pain.

Hypo-albuminemia from the lack of absorption can exacerbate loss of fluid from the vascular space.

**Pre-op Goals:** Restore vascular and interstitial volumes, correct electrolytes and acid base imbalances. Colloids are popular for hydration.

Some of these patients have been throwing up and will arrive to the Holding area without an NG Tube. You may want to consider inserting one sometime prior to induction with the patient sitting up. It is an inconvenience to the patient, but it may save the patient from aspiration during induction. If you do not insert an NG Tube, you better be prepared for a very fast RSI. I’ve seen the oropharynx fill with gastric contents within a second or two with induction.   

**Intra-op:**  
RSI with Sellick’s maneuver  
OGT to decompress the stomach  
There is still a debate on using nitrous; most of us do not.  
Neosynephrine Drip  
Don’t hesitate to give Albumin if the patient’s levels are low.

If this is an open procedure, the patient is prone to heat loss. Consider a fluid warmer and warming blanket.  
  
**Post Op**  
Awake Extubation  
Epidural: Not as common anymore.  
 

**Other Facts**  
45-60% are from abdominal adhesion  
90% of the cases involve the small bowel.  

**2 main types of intestinal obstructions:**  
**Dynamic and Adynamic:**  
**Dynamic:** Peristalsis working against a mechanical obstruction.  
**Adynamic**: No peristalsis; the patient has a paralytic ileus or some other nonpropulsive activity or process going on.

**Classifications of Obstructions**  
Volvulus with torsion of intestine.  
Incarceration in a confined space (vascular compromise and bowel infarction likely).  
Intrinsic or Extrinsic obstruction of the lumen.  
Intussusception of bowel.  

In small bowel obstruction, unrelieved increased intra-abdominal pressure will lead to diaphragmatic impingement, limited chest wall expansion, atelectasis and pneumonia.

If the obstruction is in the upper small bowel, metabolic alkalosis may occur.  
A lower GI tract obstruction leads to metabolic acidosis.

**Possible Complications**  
**Tissue Death:** Lack of blood causes the intestinal wall to die. Tissue death can result in a perforation in the intestinal wall, which can lead to infection.  
**Infection:** Peritonitis  
Aspiration during induction of anesthesia.
