### Epidural Dosing of Ropivacaine (Naropin)

**_Dr. Alyson Eastep, CRNA Summerton, SC_  
  
**More common than bupivacaine due to the lack of cardiotoxicity  
Ropivacaine differs as it has mild vasoconstrictive properties.  
Mixing epinephrine with Ropivacaine has little effect with duration.  
A newer amide long lasting local anesthetic  
A homologue of bupivacaine and mepivacaine  
25-40 % less potent than bupivacaine  
Often combined with Fentanyl or Sufenta  
Ropivacaine is unique among local anesthetics since it exhibits a vasoconstrictive effect at clinically relevant doses  
  
Used in concentrations of 0.1-0.3% for analgesia  
Used in concentrations of 0.5-1% for surgical anesthetic  
Not as potent and slightly less duration than Bupivacaine.  
Key differences include: in doses for analgesia there is excellent sensory blockade with low motor blockade and it is less cardiotoxic than bupivacaine.

_Duration varies with literature.  
With epidurals, epinephrine is usually not added to a local anesthetic to increase duration, preferring to re-dose. Some Literature states that epinephrine has no effect on Ropivacaine and other long lasting local anesthetics._  
  
**Common Labor Epidural Infusion:**  
Ropivacaine 0.2% with 1-2 ml of a narcotic (fentanyl is common). infused at 8-12 ml/hr. Another common concentration is 0.15% + 2 mcg/ml of Fentanyl.  
  
**For a Vaginal Delivery**  
Ropivacaine concentrations used to initiate epidural analgesia range from 0.08-0.2%.  
Ropivacaine at 0.2% (2mg/mL) seems to be very popular.  
The partituent is usually completely comfortable from 2 5 ml boluses (10 ml) of 0.2% ropivacaine (10 mg), followed by a PCEA rate of 10 ml per hour to cover to a T10 level.  
  
**For C-section** :  
Lidocaine is more commonly administered than ropivacaine.  
A higher level up to T4-6 is required for C-section. Hence, an increased volume (20 ml) is usually the maximum.  
If the parturient already has a good sensory level from the labor epidural, 10 ml of 2% **lidocaine** in 5 ml increments will usually reach a T4-6 level.  
Bupivacaine and Ropivacaine are the two most popular local anesthetics for an OB epidural.  
Ropivacaine is more popular than bupivacaine because it is less cardiodepressant and arrhythmogenic, resulting in a greater margin of safety in the event of unintentional intravenous injection.  
  
**Patient – Controlled Epidural Analgesia (PCEA)  
**Ropivacaine of 0.08-0.2%  
Continuous infusions are typically 8-12 mL/h  
Demand Bolus: 4-10 mL  
Lockout interval: 10-30 minutes  
  
The local anesthetics are most often combined with opioids.  
  
**Safety Points on Ropivacaine**  
Ropivacaine is a less toxic drug than bupivacaine.  
A 20 mg dose in a laboring patient is less than 0.33 mg/kg.  
This is a very safe and effective dose of local anesthetic.  
If 20 mg of ropivacaine were accidentally administered intravenously, it would be less likely than bupivacaine, and, depending on the rate of delivery, not to cause any symptoms. If a dose were accidentally given intrathecally, it is still an acceptable dose for spinal ropivacaine.
