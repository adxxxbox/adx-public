### Breast Lumpectomy

Lumpectomy is the removal of the breast tumor (the "lump").  
Technically, a lumpectomy is a partial mastectomy because part of the breast tissue is removed. Occasionally referred to as a ‘sub-total’ mastectomy.  
**Duration**: 15-45 minutes  
**Position**: Supine with arms out  
**EB**: 5-10mLs  
**IV Access**: 20G  
**Anesthetic**: Mac or General  
You need to ask the surgeon if the lump is superficial. It may only require a MAC. If the lump is deep and invasive, we usually do a General with a LMA.

Make sure your EKG leads are somewhere on the patient’s back or under the shoulder, as long as they are not near the sterile field.  
BP cuff should be opposite the surgical side, only because the surgeon may feel it’s too close to the lateral breast or his exposed sterile field.
