### Idarucizumab (Praxbind)

A monoclonal antibody that directly neutralizes the effects of Dabigatran.  
  
FDA trials currently underway for apixaband, rivaroxaban and edoxaban  
Not available at many institutions.  
  
Recommended with a major bleeding event, or in need of an urgent invasive procedure (within the next 8 hours).  
  
**Onset:** Immediate  
**Duration:** Provides full reversal up to at least 24 hours in most patients.  
**Dosage:** 5 Gm IV once as a bolus over 5 minutes per vial.  
(Available as 2.5 Gm in 50ml – dose is 2 vials)  
If very high Dabigatran levels are present (e.g. over 800-1000ng/ml), may need additional drug for full reversal.  
  
There may be a rebound of anticoagulant effect after “reversal”  
  
Unclear, but could occur if high concentrations of dabigatran are present (e.g. overdose)  
  
It is a monoclonal antibody fragment that binds with high affinity dabigatran.
