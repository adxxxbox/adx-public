### Tandem to Ovoid Brachytherapy

(Internal implantation radiotherapy)

**There are two types of brachytherapy:**  
Permanent Low Dose seed implants (LDR)  
Temporary High Dose seed implants (HDR)

**HDR-** High Dose Rate (potent seeds)-administered in Radiation Oncology and removed before the patient is discharged.  
**LDR-** Low Dose Rate (seeds)-can be administered in the OR and the patient is discharged with them.

This procedure is NOT the popular BrachyTherapy for Prostate CA. This is for treating cancers of the vagina, cervix, or endometrium.

Brachytherapy is a radiotherapy that is given ‘close to’ or ‘within’ a tumor site. “Tandem and Ovoids” is named after the applicators that are used to deliver the radiation to the top third of the vagina, cervix and uterus. Tandem applicator: Is a small metal tube which is placed inside the uterus to provide treatment to that area if the patient has not had a hysterectomy.

Ovoid applicators: A similar metal tube with a circular shape for treatment of the cervix. The applicator(s) contains no radioactivity. Radiation therapy is given through the tandem and ovoid applicators by placing radioactive seeds inside the hollow portions of the applicator. The placement of tradioactive seeds do not cause discomfort. Most patients will have three to five brachytherapy treatments. The first brachytherapy (if HDR) is more extensive than the following (LDR) treatments.

The following treatments (after the first) are usually just LDR Brachytherapy and can be completed in the operating room with deep sedation.

Some institutions may have a large brachytherapy suite and the anesthesia is performed there on site.

**Anesthetic:**  
You need to find out if this procedure is the first treatment and what the surgeon wants. This may vary accordingly with doctor’s preferences.

**Note:** If your patient is not getting a spinal or general, you should have the patient asleep before she is placed in the lithotomy position and/or pelvic exam.

**Anesthesia for a non-general or spinal:**  
Common Cocktail: 2mg of Versed, 100mcg of Fentanyl and a Propofol infusion followed by 30mg of Toradol. The Toradol is for postoperative cramps.

**First Treatment:** Usually general with an LMA. Complete relaxation is usually not requested like for a Prostate Brachytherapy.

**Other Treatments:** Not as extensive as the first. Only a room ultrasound is used and the patient goes to the recovery room after the treatment. LMA or deep MAC.  
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes  
**Position:** Lithotomy  
**IV Access:** 22-20G  
**Hydration:** Many of these patients were required to get a bowel prep. So they may be dehydrated. Consider rehydrating.  
**Foley Catheter:** Yes, it is used to fill the bladder with a saline solution. A full bladder enables the use of ultrasound during the procedure. Ultrasound is used to ensure safe and accurate placement of the applicators.  
**Bowel Prep:** usually  
**EBL:** Minimal

**Possible Complications:**  
Spotting or bleeding from the vagina.  
Vaginal cramping after the procedure.  
Peroneal nerve injury secondary to lithotomy position. This rarely occurs.

**More Notes:**  
A Foley catheter is first placed into the bladder. The applicators are then placed in position; one inside the cervix (known as a tandem), and two at the top of the vagina (known as ovoids); as close to the cancer tumor as possible.  
A plastic spatula is inserted under the ovoids to push the rectum away and some gauze packing is placed inside the vagina to push the bladder away.

During treatment, either the HDR or the LDR, the radioactive source will pass through both the tandem and the ovoid. HDR is much more extensive and uses a radiation machine that is not permitted in the poorly insulated operating rooms. They are located in radiation oncology. HDR- After the insertion for the 1st procedure, a stitch is placed between the applicators and the skin of the thighs to prevent the applicators moving while the patient is taken downstairs to Radiation Oncology. A CT Scan is done to analyze where the tumor is located and analyze the areas for treatment. A treatment plan is made to conform the dose to the tumor itself.

The applicators are then attached to the radiation machine, called the Microselectron. Brachytherapy (HDR) starts when the radiation machine sends the radioactive source into the applicators. After the first treatment is complete, the patient is disconnected from the radiation machine. The applicators and the gauze pack will be removed. For all the following brachytherapy treatments, the applicators and Foley catheter are usually removed in the operating room while the patient is still asleep. Ultrasound scanning is used to confirm placement of the applicators.
