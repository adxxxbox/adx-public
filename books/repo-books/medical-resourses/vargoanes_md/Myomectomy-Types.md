### Myomectomies - Types

**Laparoscopic Myomectomy**: The surgeon removes the fibroids and repairs the defect left behind where the fibroid was located. Proper repair of the defect in uterine wall is of extreme importance in the prevention of complications. A small incision is made, usually in the navel, and a laparoscope is inserted through which the myomectomy is performed. This type of myomectomy offers the fastest recovery time.

**Laparoscopic Myomectomy with Colpotomy:** This is a laparoscopic procedure that also involves an incision in the vagina to remove large pieces of fibroids. This procedure does not close the defect left by the fibroid and must be performed in conjunction with another procedure.

**Laparoscopic Mini-laparoscopic Myomectomy**: The Laparoscopic Assisted Myomectomy (LAM) is a laparoscopic procedure which also includes a small traditional abdominal incision to remove the fibroids. This type of procedure can be used for any size of fibroid. Because the incision is only 4-5 cm, the recovery is quicker than from a conventional open myomectomy.
