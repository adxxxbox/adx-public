Inhalation induction   

### Inhalation induction

  
_Edited by Mary McDonough Smith, CRNA_

After deeming a patient an appropriate candidate for an inhalation induction,  
bring patient into the room and transfer/place on the OR table. Depending on the temperament, premedication (or lack thereof), and developmental level of the child; place standard monitors.

Optimize your time by placing monitors on the OR table where they would naturally be placed on the patient.

If the infant is screaming, place the pulse ox only until they are more cooperative/relax after initiating mask induction. Other monitors can be placed in a successive progression based upon patient tolerance & overall safety (i.e. EKG,NIBP, etc.) (unless contraindicated due to co-morbidities i.e. congenial cardiac disease).

**Note:** For a good view for intubation or even appropriate position for ventilation- I like either a sheet or a couple of surgical towels rolled up and put under the superior scapulae (i.e. commonly referred to as “shoulder roll” within the pediatric anesthesia community).

To start the induction, usually one of three things are done:  
  

1) Child is inconsolable- 70% N20/30% 02 with Sevoflurane 8% immediately with mask (circuit can also be primed to speed process). Fastest/most rapid inhalation induction; ensure proper mask fit. Goal is to, as rapidly as possible, have child inhale the highest concentration of inhalation agent(s).  
  

2) Child is cooperative: 70%N20/30%02 for a period of time to desensitize the mucous membrane before adding sevoflurane 2-3% at a time, every 3-5 breaths until 8%.  
  
3) When N20 is contraindicated (In presence any anticipated obstruction (severe OSA), pulmonary disease, when 100% 02 is needed, when a very deep anesthetic depth is not optimal): 02 and Sevoflurane only.  
  
**Note:** When inducing a neonate/infant <5kg, we usually induce with max 4-6% sevoflurane and 02 only (100% 02 due to increased 02 consumption and less sevoflurane to optimize hemodynamics).

_\*\*ALWAYS be aware of neonate/infant/child heart rate (HR) during an inhalation induction. As this population is dependent upon their HR for CO (due to a fixed stroke volume (SV)); bradycardia will greatly decrease CO and if left unchecked can results in cardiovascular collapse. If the HR begins to decrease precipitously, decrease the inhaled concentration of the inhalation agents as appropriate. Positive pressure (to a reasonable degree) will aid greatly in maintaining a patent airway and preventing in obstruction._

After your patient is in stage 3 anesthetic depth, peripheral IV is established.  
**Note:** We usually keep IV supplies in a basin nearby or on the anesthesia cart until the child is asleep. We do not want the child to see it. Then we place at the foot of the bed foot of bed just prior to inserting one. Ensure that the child is at an adequate anesthetic depth prior to IV insertion. This stimuli can precipitate laryngospasm, etc. if that patient is “light”. Remember, priority is airway, airway, airway.

  
N20 is turned off when patient is in stage three and anesthetic depth is adequate to avoid diffusion hypoxia on intubation. Once IV is placed, meds can be given to prepare for placement of ETT/LMA.

Propofol can be bolused at 1-3 mg/kg directed by the sympathetic tone of the patient as indicated by BP & HR. Muscle relaxation can be given if needed for the procedure (and not using LMA), often Vecuronium 0.1mg/kg (or Rocuronium).

Narcotic of choice (fentanyl 1-2 mcg/kg).  
  
Continue to mask until onset of NMBD or propofol if NDMD not given, usually continued with sevoflurane. Place oral airway if needed at any time during the inhalation induction. Make note, if the patient isn’t deep enough, the oral airway may cause reactivity.  
  
Sometimes, adjective drugs are not necessary and placement of the LMA/ETT can occur when the patient is at a deep anesthetic depth with only volatile agents. Place the LMA/ETT, confirm placement with ETC02, chest rise, and auscultation. Insert air in the cuffed ETT’s’ cuff by listening for an air leak while incrementally increasing the pressure within the circuit to 20 cm H20, and add air to the cuff until the leak is acceptable.
