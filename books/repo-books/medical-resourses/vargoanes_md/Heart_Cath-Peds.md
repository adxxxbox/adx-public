### Heart Cath-Peds

  
By Katie Hatcher Hickerson CRNA, Loma Linda University Children's Hospital  
  
**Brief Overview:**  
During pediatric cardiac catheterization, catheters are inserted into the left and right sides of the heart through arterial and venous vascular access sites. Access to the heart can be retrograde (through the left side of the heart) and is almost always achieved through the femoral artery. Antegrade access (venous access to the right side of the heart) is usually achieved through the femoral vein but may be through the IJ or occasionally transhepatically. Using these catheters, various measurements can be taken in the heart, angiography can be performed and various interventions for congenital and acquired heart defects and disease may be treated.  
  
**Indications**  
Diagnostic heart caths are performed for a variety of reasons, some of the most common reasons being:  
1) To assess complex heart lesions,  
2) To assist in decision making on pharmacologic or surgical treatment in patients with pulmonary HTN,  
3) Endomyocardial biopsy for heart transplant rejection, diagnosis of myocarditis or genetic testing for cardiomyopathies, and  
4) To assess diagnostic measurements prior to an interventional cardiac cath.  
  
**Information cardiologists often derive from a diagnostic cath are:**  
1) Cardiac output and index,  
2) Vascular resistances,  
3) Various shunts,  
4) Valve areas,  
5) Pressure gradients and  
6) Visualization of cardiac and vascular structures via angiography with contrast injections.  
  
**Pre-op and preparation  
**1) **Labs:** Routine pre-op labs are not needed for a diagnostic heart cath. If an intervention isbeing performed in addition, then a T&S +/- T&C should be considered.  
Pre-op labs should be drawn according to patient condition and disease process.2) **Cardiac Workup:** These kids will always have an echo and EKG and sometimes a  
cardiac CT, cardiac MRI, CXR, ultrasound examination of vascular access or other  
pertinent tests as ordered by the pediatric cardiologist.  
3 **) Sedation:** Pre-procedure versed is often a great idea for these kids as many of them have had multiple hospitalizations/caths/surgeries and they can be very anxious.  
4) **Anesthetic:** Usually general anesthesia but some teenagers may tolerate MAC with propofol infusion +/- precedex infusion +/- versed and fentanyl  
  
**Airway issues:** LMA okay for right and left heart cath +/- biopsy. The pt will need an ETT if intervention is planned. If the kid is post-Glenn but pre-Fontan, the cardiologist will need to access thru the RIJ so discuss LMA vs ETT with cardiologist. If an intervention is planned, put in an ETT.  
  
**Induction:** Standard inhalation or IV induction unless child needs cardiac induction secondary to cardiac instability. No nitrous for induction with severe pulmonary HTN.  
  
**Nitrous:** No nitrous use during case because N2O causes an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance due to constriction of the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle which may lead to an increase in right atrial pressure.  
  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Not indicated  
  
**Position:**  
1) Pt supine  
2) BUE positioned up and beside pt’s head as they need to be out of the way for lateral views with fluoro. Arms should be positioned close to pt’s ears and padded well to decrease the chance of brachial plexus injury.  
3) If NIBP cuff is on an upper extremity, the cuff will usually read about 10 - 15mmHg lower than the arterial line pressure. Therefore base your treatment of the BP off of the arterial line reading once it's available.  
4) Foam padding under heels. Kids often complain of heel pain after cardiac caths.  
  
**Duration:** 1.5 - 2 hrs; if doing a pulmonary HTN study as well add 30-45 minutes to the total time  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV access:**  
1) PIVx1isfine  
2) You don’t need to start an a-line. The cardiologist will start an arterial line that you can  
reference (arterial line will allow for pressure readings in the left side of the heart. The arterial line pressure will not always be available for your reference when the cardiologist is getting LA and LV etc pressures.)  
3) The cardiologist will also have a venous line for right sided heart pressures that you can use if needed for IV access if the kid is a very difficult stick.  
4) Lots of these kids are very difficult PIV sticks because they have had multiple surgeries and hospitalizations.  
  
**Hydration:** depends upon the kid’s cardiac condition.  
  
**Emergence:** Once the procedure is finished, the arterial and venous lines will be removed and pressure will be held on the groin insertion sites for 10 -20 minutes. You should wake up the patient after hemostasis is achieved and pressure dressings are in place. A deep LMA/ETT removal is preferred. You don’t want the kid coughing and bucking because it will increase the chance of bleeding at the groin sites. Also, consider treating with antiemetics prior to emergence for 2 reasons; 1) the patient will need to lie flat for 4 - 6 hours after the procedure and 2) because vomiting will also increase the risk of groin site bleeding. Obviously be sure that you can effectively mask ventilate all kids, but especially Fontan kids, if you are going to do a deep extubation.  
  
**How to treat a drop in BP:  
**1) Discuss treatment of BP with cardiologist prior to administering a pressor. It is desirable  
to have the patient’s hemodynamic parameters as close to baseline as possible and giving ephedrine, phenylephrine and epi will change these parameters and therefore affect the pressures that the cardiologist is trying to assess. If you need to treat the patient’s hypotension, of course do so, but communicate with the cardiologist so they can factor the pressors into their calculations of the patient’s baseline hemodynamic parameters.  
2) Remember that if you have the NIBP cuff on the arm, the BP readings are likely to be falsely low. Reference the arterial line prior to treating.  
3) If the patient has coarctation of the aorta, monitor NIBP on right arm. Except in the rare case that the coarctation is proximal to the innominate artery, right arm BP will be more indicative of blood flow to the brain.  
  
**Possible Complications:  
**1) Pulmonary HTN - patients with severe and suprasystemic pulmonary HTN are at risk of RV failure and hemodynamic collapse so avoid hypoxemia, hypercarbia, hypothermia and acidosis!  
2) Brachial Plexus injury secondary to positioning.  
3) Post-operative bleeding at groin vascular access sites.  
4) Radiation exposure - for the patient and anesthesia (wear lead and use a shield and lead glasses, stand as far from fluoro as possible.)  
5) Contrast dye reaction
