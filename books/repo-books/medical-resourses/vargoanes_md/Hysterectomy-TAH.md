Total Abdominal Hysterectomy (TAH) OPEN     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Total Abdominal Hysterectomy (TAH) OPEN:

A TAH can be performed via robot laparoscopy or a hand assisted LAVH.

But when you see the word **Open, t**his means a large open incisional abdominal hysterectomy: the way they did these cases 20+ years ago before laparoscopy came along. The open TAH procedure is not very common anymore. It has been replaced with more minimally invasive methods such as robot laparoscopy or a hand assisted LAVH. However, open hysterectomies are still performed for various reasons: cancer, suspected scar tissue or heavy adhesions.

**Open Total Abdominal Hysterectomy (TAH):** Is a large abdominal incision to remove the uterus and cervix. The surgeon detaches the uterus from the ovaries, fallopian tubes and upper vagina as well as from the blood vessels and connective tissues that support it. The patient usually keeps her ovaries. _Note:_ It is a good practice to ask the patient if she is keeping her ovaries/tubes. At our facility, if the patient is having a TAH with a BSO, or Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy, there is a separate permit for the sterilization part of the procedure. Even 60-70 year old females have to sign both permits.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT.  
**Epidural:** Sometimes for post op pain; not as common any more.  
**Spinal:** Rare because the duration of the procedure may sometimes outlast the spinal block. The surgeon also may place the patient in steep Trendelenburg for most of the procedure and no one wants a spinal block moving north while patient is in T-burg.  
**Duration:** 1.5-4 hours.  
**Induction:** Have Ephedrine and Neosynephrine available since this patient may be hypovolemic from the bowel prep that many Gynecologists order.  
**IV Access:** At least 18g.  
**A-line:** usually not needed.  
**Fluid warmer:** Yes, these patients are more prone to hypothermia; however, many anesthesia providers just use a Bair hugger or a forced air warmer.  
**EBL:** 200-500 mLs.  
**Type & Screened:** Yes; a good idea. Also a current CBC is necessary; many hysterectomies are done because of some kind of menorrhagia or dysmenorrhea, both of which many lower the hemoglobin.  
**OGT: U**sually placed post induction an empty stomach is good while in Trendelenburg.  
**Hydration**: Try to pre-hydrate the patient adequately in the pre-op unit. Many of these patients are hypovolemic before the case from a bowel prep.    
**Foley:** Yes.  
**Bair Hugger:** Yes, upper body.  
**Neosynephrine Drip**: Have available.

**Possible Complications:**  
Bleeding  
Wound Infection.  
Bowel or bladder injury.  
  
**Hydration**:  
To replace the post Bowel Prep fluid deficit, we usually administer 1 liter of crystalloids. Some literature states to replace a bowel prep with 500 mLs - 2 liters.

Current literature says to hydrate third space fluid losses in an open abdomen case with  
12-15cc/kg in the 1st hour; then 6-10cc/kg/hr thereafter.
