### Closed Reduction – Hip

  
These procedures are done ASAP to prevent avascular necrosis. If the patient has a prosthetic hip, avascular necrosis is not an issue. The patient is taken to surgery and temporarily put to sleep for the surgeon to simply pop the femur back into the socket. This procedure usually only takes a few seconds or minutes. A C-arm is utilized for verification.

A hip dislocation is very painful. Patients are unable to move the leg. If the patient has nerve damage, there may be little sensation in the foot or ankle area.

These closed reductions used to be done in the pre-op area. The hospitals/surgeons can bill more if the reduction is performed in the operating room.

**Anesthesia:** General/LMA or Propofol with NC or a mask. Sometimes the surgeon will demand relaxation. I have seen an LMA and low dose Anectine given just prior to manipulation.

**Another method:** Patient remains on their hospital bed: some Lidocaine, Propofol and some Anectine may be given. Insert an oral airway and utilize mask ventilation. A regular x-ray can verify the reduction. Extremely obese patients can make this procedure more difficult to perform. I have seen a couple of surgeons actually stand up in the patient’s stretcher or bed to get the reduction force necessary to place these hips back in position.

**Duration:** 10 seconds-5 minutes  
**IV Access:** 22-20G  
**Positioning:** Supine  
**EBL:** None  
 

**Possible Complications:**  
Avascular necrosis.  
Neurological injury, even after a successful closed reduction.

Sciatic neuropraxia, often from damage to the Peroneal branch, occurs in up to 5% of pediatric dislocations and in approximately 10-15% of adult traumatic hip dislocations.  
The sciatic nerve can be lacerated, stretched, compressed, or encased in heterotopic ossification.  
 

**More Notes**

A hip dislocation can have long-term consequences, particularly if there are associated fractures. As the thighbone is pushed out of its socket, it can disrupt blood vessels and nerves. When blood supply to the bone is lost, the bone can die, resulting in avascular necrosis or osteonecrosis. The protective cartilage covering the bone may also be damaged, which increases the risk of developing arthritis in the joint.
