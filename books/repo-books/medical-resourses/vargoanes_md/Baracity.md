**Baracity and Local Anesthetics**

**_Edited by Daniel D. Moos CRNA_**

**Influences the affect the spread of a local anesthetic (LA) in the subarachnoid space:  
**Density  
Dose  
Concentration  
Temperature  
Volume.  
  
**Density -** weight of 1 ml of solution in grams at a standard temperature.  
**Specific Gravity -** density of a solution in a ratio, compared to the density of water.  
**Baracity -** the ratio comparing the density of one solution to another.  
**Density/baracity -** the density or baracity of the local anesthetic exerts one of the greatest effects on subsequent height of the block.  
  
Local anesthetic movement within CSF is dependent on its density (baracity) in relation to that of the CSF. In other words, the specific gravity of the local anesthetic vs the specific gravity of the CSF.  
  
**CSF at 37 degrees C has a specific gravity of 1.003-1.008.  
**_An LA solution can be hyperbaric, hypobaric, or isobaric.  
_**Isobaric LA** means the LA has a specific gravity equal the CSF.  
When initially administered in the CSF, there will be equal distribution.  
  
**Hyperbaric LA** means that the solution is heavier (greater specific gravity) than the CSF.  
Dextrose is added to the local anesthetic solution to make it hyperbaric.  
When initially administered in the CSF, the LA will move caudal (down) when patient is SITTING UP. This only occurs for about the first several minutes.  
Meaning, after the spinal takes effect (remember-spinals have a quick onset), changing the patient’s position will have little effect since most of the LA has already penetrated the spinal nerve roots.  
  
**Note-spinal for C-section:** after injecting a hyperbaric LA, you need to lay the patient down ASAP. The longer the patient remains sitting up, the more of the hyperbaric solution will settle lower will settle in the perineal area-S2-S4. Remember that we want the spinal to extend up to T4 (nipple level).  
  
**Note:** When a solution injected above L3 and the patient is placed in a supine position, the solution will spread cephalad until it reaches the T4 curvature where it levels. This naturally limits its spread.  
  
**Supine and Hyperbaric LAs** In general, hyperbaric solutions will also be limited in movement when the patient is placed supine. It should not transverse the apex of the thoracic kyphosis unless the dose or volume is large enough to transverse this area. Immediately after injection the hyperbaric local anesthetic will move toward the T4-T8 area. The apex, following the normal curvature of the spine, is T4. See below:

As you monitor the progress of your block you can influence the spread by placing your patient in Trendelenburg or reverse Trendelenburg position. There is a limited amount of time this can be done.  
  
**Hypobaric LA** means that the solution is lighter (lesser specific gravity) than the CSF.  
Hypobaric solutions are created by adding sterile water to the solution.  
When initially administered in the CSF, the LA will move caudal cephalad when patient is SITTING UP.  
  
Local anesthetic agents mixed in a 1:1 ratio with CSF create an isobaric solution. Alternatively, sterile distilled water may be used to achieve a baracity < 0.9990, thus becoming hypobaric.

**Baracity and the spread of local anesthetics with patient positions  
Head down position  
**Hyperbaric solution will spread cephalad  
Hypobaric solution will spread caudad.  
  
**Head up position**  
Hyperbaric solution will spread caudad.  
Hypobaric solution will spread cephalad.  
  
**Lateral position**  
Hyperbaric solution will spread towards the dependent area  
Hypobaric solution will spread to the non-dependent area.  
  
**Isobaric**  
Isobaric solution will stay within the general area of injection.  
  
**Spinal and C-section  
**After injecting a hyperbaric solution, the patient is placed supine.  
The local anesthetic will move toward the T4-T8 area.  
The apex, following the normal curvature of the spine, is T4.
