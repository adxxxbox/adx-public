Giapreza (Angiotensin II)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Giapreza (Angiotensin II)

**Giapreza** is a non-catecholamine vasoconstrictor to increase BP in adults with septic or other distributive shocks.  
  
\- It is usually considered when septic shock is refractory to norepinephrine and vasopressin.  
\- FDA approved in 2017  
\- A clear, aqueous solution.  
  
**Review of Angiotensin II:**  
Angiotensinogen originates in the liver, is cleaved to angiotensin I by renin in the kidney, and is further cleaved to angiotensin II by ACE, primarily in the lungs.  
Angiotensin II has many effects throughout the body, including modulation of sympathetic activity and electrolyte and free water homeostasis.  
It is also a potent direct vasoconstrictor and potentiates the release of both aldosterone and ADH.  
  
**Warning and precautions:**There is a potential for venous and arterial thrombotic and thromboembolic events in patients who receive Giapreza.  
Use concurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis.  
  
**Dosing:  
\- Continuous infusion dose:** 20 nanograms (ng)/kg/min  
\- It can be titrated every 5 minutes by increments of up to 15 ng/kg/min  
\- Do not exceed 80 ng/kg/min during the first 3 hours.**\- Maintenance doses:** should NOT exceed 40 ng/kg/min.  
\- Doses as low as 1.25 ng/kg/min may be used.  
\- Once the underlying shock has sufficiently improved, down-titrate every 5 to 15 minutes by increments of up to 15 ng/kg/min based on blood pressure.  
  
The usual target mean arterial pressure for critically ill patients is 65 – 75 mmHg.  
  
**Preparation:  
**Giapreza must be diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride prior to use.  
Dilute the contents of one vial of Giapreza in 0.9% saline to achieve a final concentration of 5,000 ng/mL or 10,000 ng/mL.  
  
**For calculating continuous infusions, nanograms must be converted onto micrograms (mcg).**  
10,000 ng/mL bag = 10 mcg/mL or .01 mg/mL  
5,000 ng/mL bag = 5 mcg/mL or .005 mg/mL  
  
**Nanogram = mg = mcg:  
**1 million nanograms = 1 mg  
100,000 nanograms = 0.1mg = 100 mcg  
10,000 nanograms = .01 mg = 10 mcg  
1,000 nanograms = 0.001 mg = 1mcg  
100 nanograms = 0.001 mg = 0.1 mcg  
20 nanograms = 0.0001 mg = 0.02 mcg  
  
**Mcg/kg/min** \= desired dose x 60 x weight/bag concentration

**  
Adverse reactions:**  
The most common adverse reactions reported in greater than 10% in Giapreza treated patients were thromboembolic events.  
**  
Special populations:  
Elderly:  
**There are limited efficacy and safety data on Giapreza in patients > 75 years.  
No special dose adjustment is required in patients over 75 years.  
As for other age groups, it is essential to closely monitor blood pressure response and adjust the dose accordingly.  
**  
Renal or hepatic impairment:  
**No special dose adjustment is required in patients with renal insufficiency or those with hepatic impairment.  
As for other patient populations, it is essential to monitor blood pressure response and adjust doses accordingly.  
**  
Pediatric population:  
**The safety and efficacy of Giapreza in children under 18 years old have yet to be established.  
No data are available.  
  
**Contraindications:** None  
**  
Adverse reactions to Giapreza:  
**Thromboembolic events (up to 12%)  
Deep vein thrombosis (4%)  
Thrombocytopenia  
Tachycardia  
Fungal infection  
Delirium  
Acidosis  
Hyperglycemia  
Peripheral ischemia  
  
**Drug interactions:**  
**Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors:** Concomitant use of ACE inhibitors may increase the response to Giapreza.  
  
**Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARB):  
**Concomitant use of angiotensin II blockers (ARBs) may decrease the response to Giapreza.  
  
**Pregnancy:**  
The published data on angiotensin II use in pregnant women is insufficient to determine a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. |  
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with GIAPREZA.  
**Lactation:** It is not known whether GIAPREZA is present in human milk  
  
**Mechanism of action:**  
Angiotensin II raises blood pressure by vasoconstriction and increases aldosterone release. Direct action of angiotensin II on the vessel wall is mediated by binding to the G-protein-coupled angiotensin II receptor type 1 on vascular smooth muscle cells, which stimulates Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of myosin and causes smooth muscle contraction.  
  
**Metabolism and excretion:  
**No specific studies were conducted that examined the metabolism and excretion of GIAPREZA.  
  
**Plasma half-life:** Less than one minute.  
It is metabolized by aminopeptidase A and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 to angiotensin-(2-8) \[angiotensin III\] and angiotensin-(1-7), respectively, in plasma, erythrocytes, and many of the major organs (i.e., intestine, kidney, liver, and lung).  
  
Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) mediated activity of angiotensin III is approximately 40% of angiotensin II; however, aldosterone synthesis activity is similar to angiotensin II. Angiotensin-(1-7) exerts the opposite effects of angiotensin II on AT1 receptors and causes vasodilation  
  
**Renal impairment:** The clearance of angiotensin II is not dependent on renal function.  
  
**Hepatic Impairment:** The clearance of angiotensin II is not dependent on hepatic function.
