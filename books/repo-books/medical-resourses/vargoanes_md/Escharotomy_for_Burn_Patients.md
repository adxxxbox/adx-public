### Eschar and Escharotomy for Burn Patients

(From French, eschare meaning scar or scab)

After a severe burn, the patient’s skin becomes leathery and thicker in appearance and consistent with dead tissue (eschar) that can be brown, tan, and / or black in color. Eschar may also be filled with fluid.  
  
The eschar itself serves as a medium for bacterial growth within the wound bed and will contribute a source of local and systemic infection. The inelasticity of the eschar matrix may result in a burn-induced compartment syndrome. This is caused by the accumulation of extracellular and extravascular fluid within the confined anatomic spaces of the burn injury. The excessive fluid causes the intracompartmental pressures to increase, resulting in collapse of the contained vascular and lymphatic structures resulting in loss of tissue perfusion and viability.  
  
The capillary closure pressure of 30 mmHg, also measured as the compartment pressure, is accepted as the threshold requiring intervention to prevent tissue death.  
  
  
Escharotomy  
An escharotomy is an incision made completely through the depth of the burn “eschar.”  
The goal is to release constricting tissue, restore perfusion, and allow nerves, muscles, and organs to function as normal. Usually several incisions are required to release the constricting tissue. This procedure is usually done while the patient is sedated and sometimes under general anesthesia. Escharotomies usually occur within the first 24-72 hours of the injury.  
  
If there is a circumferential burn (partial or full), the tissues next to the burn eschar are at risk of edema and permanent functional impairment. If untreated, sometimes the part of the body next to the burn eschar has to be amputated and nerve and muscle death may occur.  
  
Careful attention and consideration must be given to the patient’s increased risk for hypothermia and infection as more wounds are created. Collaboration should be made with the burn team to ensure there is no delay in appropriate post-operative wound care.  
  
Induction and maintenance of anesthesia may require higher doses of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs due to up-regulation of acetylcholine receptors post injury; decreased sensitivity to nondepolarizing drugs. Succinylcholine is usually avoided due to hyperkalemic risk factors.  
  
Some literature tells us that escharotomy requires just a little analgesia or anesthesia because most full thickness burns have little sensation.  
However in practice, we find that scald burns that have significant partial thickness-burn components are very painful with escharotomy from nerves still intact. Postoperative pain control may require increased needs as these patient are often maintained on high dose narcotics while in burn units or critical care areas.
