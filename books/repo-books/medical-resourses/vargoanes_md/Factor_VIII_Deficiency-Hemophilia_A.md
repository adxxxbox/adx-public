### Factor VIII Deficiency-Hemophilia A

Hemophilia A The most common type of hemophilia: 80% (B and C are less common).  
Hemophilia B involves factor IX.  
Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive hereditary hemorrhagic disease, causing deficiency of functional plasma clotting factor VIII.  
Hemorrhagic complications may occur if perioperative hemostatic preparation is inadequate or is poorly planned.  
Hemophilia A can also arise from spontaneous mutation.  
**Incidence of hemophilia A:** About 1 in 5,000 males.  
1 in 10,000 births.  
  
**Possible Manifestations of Hemophilia A (prolonged bleeding and re-bleeds)  
**Hemophiliacs do not bleed more intensely than normal but can bleed for much longer period. When a blood vessel is injured, missing coagulation factors prevent fibrin formation which is necessary to maintain the blood clot.  
In severe hemophiliacs, even minor injuries could result in blood loss lasting for days, weeks or not ever healing completely.  
Prolonged bleeding with circumcision, dental work and surgery.  
Muscle hematomas.  
Generalized joint pain - hemophilic arthopathy: recurrent bleeding into joints which may result in orthopedic procedures. throughout life.  
Intracranial hemorrhage.  
  
**Classification of Hemophilia A**  
Classification is according to baseline level of clotting factor VIII activity.  
Factor VIII activity levels are reported in units with 1 U/ml corresponding to 100% of factor found in 1 ml of normal plasma.  
Levels of normal plasma activity: 0.5 U/ml - 1.5 U/ml (50-150%).  
  
**Hemophilia A classification by factor VIII activity**

| Classification | Factor VIII Activity % | Cause of hemorrhage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mild | \> 5-40 | Major trauma or surgery |
| Moderate | 1-5 | Mild-to-moderate trauma |
| Severe | < 1 | Spontaneous, hemarthrosis |

**A documented Hematologists Perioperative Plan with Hemophilia A  
**Maintain close to 100% factor VIII concentration on the day of surgery and first 2 postoperative days;  
75% on day 3, 4, and 5; and then 50% for next 5 days.  
  
**Possible Pre-op Labs** (should be previously ordered by consulting hematologist)  
CBC.  
aPTT/PT/INR.  
BMP.  
Platelet count and function.  
FVIII, IX and von Willebrand factor assays.  
Fibrinogen activity (Clauss assay).  
Factor VIII inhibitors.  
  
**New onset of hemophilia should also have:**  
Hepatitis C virus (HCV).  
ALT, AST, HCV antibody.  
HCV genotype.  
HIV antibody.  
HCV and HIV viral loads are only required if patients have tested positive for the respective antibody.  
  
**Anesthesia Peri-operative precautions and meticulous care for:  
**IV starts.  
Intramuscular injections.  
Tracheal intubations.  
Oropharyngeal suction.  
Central line insertions should be done under ultrasound guidance.  
Maintenance of BP to avoid access bleeding.  
  
**Does the hemophiliac patient have circulating inhibitors? (hematology decision))**  
Pre-operatively, there should already be a diagnosis for the presence of factor VIII inhibitors.  
This is assessed by the patient’s hematologist with a lab test: “mixing study.”  
The presence of factor VIII inhibitors will determine if the patient will be treated with factor VIII concentrate or an inhibitor bypass drug PCC or recombinant factor VIIa (NovoSeven).  
  
**Factor VIII Inhibitors  
**Up to 30% of patients with severe hemophilia A who have previously received factor VIII concentrate or recombinant factor VIIa will develop inhibitor molecules (antibodies) against factor VIII (hemophilia A inhibitor patients). This makes it difficult to treat the patient with factor VIII.  
  
**Hemophilia A inhibitor patients – Low and High Responders  
Low responders:** Have low titers of inhibitors and respond to factor VIII concentrate.  
Larger initial and maintenance doses of factor VIII concentrate will be required and frequent factor VIII assays need to be monitored.  
  
**Factor VIII replacement equation:** Required units = body weight (kg) × desired factor VIII rise (%) × 0.5. Factor VIII should be infused slowly at a rate not more than 2 ml/minute.  
  
**High responders:** Have high titers with a poor response to factor VIII concentrate.  
  
**High responders will require an inhibitor bypassing drug:**  
Activated prothrombin complex concentrates or  
Recombinant factor VIIa (NovoSeven) - successful in 80% of patients with inhibitors.  
  
**New medication for Hemophilia A  
Hemlibra (emicizumab) for Hemophilia A with or without inhibitors**  
**Hemlibra** is a recombinant, humanized, bispecific immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody that substitutes for part of the cofactor function of activated factor VIII (FVIIIa) by bridging activated factor IX(FIXa) and factor X(FX).  
**Indications:** Routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adults and children of all ages, newborn and older, with hemophilia A with and without factor VIII inhibitors.  
**Doses:** Loading dose of 3 mg/kg weekly for 4 doses, followed by one of three subsequent long-term dose regimens: either 1.5 mg/kg weekly or 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, or 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks.  
_There is significant reduction in annualized bleeding rates at all doses for all age groups, with or without inhibitors._    
  
**NovoSeven doses:** 90-120 mcg/kg pre-op, then Q2 hours for the first 28 hours.  
**FEIBA (factor VIII inhibitor bypassing agent):** 75-100 units/kg, then 70 units/kg every 6-8 hours for 3 days are FDA approved for hemophilia A inhibitor patients.  
  
A severe hemophilia-like syndrome can occur in genetically normal people because if the appearance of an acquired autoantibody to either factor VIII or IX.  
  
**Surgery with hemophilia A  
**Factor VIII level must be brought close to a normal 100% prior to the procedure.  
Factor VIII assays can determine activity level.  
  
**Mild hemophilia A (Factor VIII activity level > 5-40%) with NO factor VIII inhibitors  
**Intranasal or IV of DDAVP (Desmopressin) may be sufficient.  
  
**DDAVP Dose:** 0.3 mcg/kg 30 minutes prior to surgery.  
  
**DDAVP -** Acts by releasing VWF which in turn forms a complex with factor VIII, thereby preventing its breakdown. It is commonly used for the treatment of mild form of hemophilia A and VWD.  
  
DDAVP also produces a two- to five-fold increase in factor VIII levels which may be sufficient for minor surgery in mild hemophilia.  
These patients should have had a previous trial demonstrating an adequate response to DDAVP.  
Tranexamic acid is optional.  
  
**Moderate to Severe Hemophilia with NO factor VIII inhibitors  
**Factor VIII concentrate-pre-op and up to 2 weeks post-op.  
Factor VIII should be infused slowly at a rate not more than 2 ml/minute.  
Half-life of factor VIII is 12 hours. Repeated infusions are required every 8-12 hours in order to keep factor VIII levels > 50%.  
In children the half-life is shorter and requires more frequent transfusions.  
Peak and trough levels of factor VIII must be monitored.  
  
FFP and cryoprecipitate may also correct FVIII levels.  
  
**FFP:** 1 ml of FFP will provide one unit of factor VIII activity.**Cryoprecipitate:** Contains FVIII, von Willebrand factor and fibrinogen. Can be used when FVIII concentrates are NOT available.  
30-40 ml of cryoprecipitate provides 80 U of factor VIII.  
  
**Antifibrinolytics:** aminocaproic acid (Amicar) or tranexamic acid as adjunctive therapy for bleeding from the mucous membranes or dental procedures.  
  
**Recommended Factor VIII levels**

**Regional Anesthesia and hemophilia A  
**Regional or neuraxial anesthesia are best avoided as there is a high risk of hemorrhagic complications, such as epidural hematoma.  
Local anesthetic infiltration with lidocaine is very commonly used for minor procedures such as dental extractions after adequate factor replacement therapy.
