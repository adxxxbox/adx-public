### Bartholin’s Cyst or Abscess  
Excision of, aka Marsupialization

The Bartholin glands are a pair of pea-sized, vulvovaginal, mucous-secreting vestibular glands that are located in the labia minora in the 4 and 8-o'clock positions, beneath the bulbospongiosus muscle.  
These glands secrete fluid that helps lubricate the vagina. Sometimes the openings of these glands become obstructed, causing fluid to back up into the gland. At times, the fluid within the cyst may become infected, resulting in pus surrounded by inflamed tissue (abscess).  
This cyst can become infected, forming an abscess. A number of bacteria may cause the infection, including common bacteria such as E. coli, as well as bacteria that cause sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia.

A Bartholin's cyst or abscess is common. Treatment of a Bartholin's cyst depends on the size of the cyst, the pain and whether the cyst is infected.

If a cyst or abscess keeps coming back, a surgical procedure known as marsupialization may be used. In marsupialization, the cyst is opened with an incision and the fluid is drained out. The edges of the skin are then stitched in a way that prevents further fluid build-up by allowing it to drain out. This creates a pouch similar to a kangaroo’s pouch, hence the name marsupialization.

**Anesthetic:** Usually General/LMA or room air general. LMA is more popular.  
**Duration:** 10-30 minutes  
**Position:** Lithotomy with the arms out, slight Trendelenburg.  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
**EBL:** Minimal

**Possible Complications:**  
Bleeding  
Nerve damage to the vulvar region  
Hematoma  
There is also a higher risk of complications when the whole cyst is removed.

**More Notes**  
**Different techniques exist for the treatment of Bartholin cysts and abscesses. These include:**  
Silver nitrate gland ablation.  
Cyst or abscess fenestration, ablation, or excision using carbon dioxide (CO2) laser. Marsupialization.  
Needle aspiration with or without alcohol sclerotherapy.  
Fistulization using a Word catheter, Foley catheter, or Jacobi ring. Gland excision.  
Incision and drainage followed by primary suture closure.

No recurrence after marsupialization has been reported in available studies. Recurrence after other treatments has varied and was most common after aspiration alone (approximately 38%). Healing generally occurred in 2 weeks or less.

**Word Catheter:** A small latex catheter with an inflatable balloon to hold it in place. It is used to drain a Bartholin’s ductal abscess.
