Colonoscopy for Peds   

### Colonoscopy for Peds

  
_Edited by Michael Couillard, CRNA, Charlotte, NC._  
  
A colonoscopy with pediatrics is pretty much the same as an adult except the peds cases are usually much shorter in duration and there are usually no cardiac issues to worry about like CAD or HTN.  
A Colonoscopy is an endoscopic medical procedure and is one of many methods to screen for colon cancer, IBS, Crohn’s disease and other intestines disorders. The colonoscope is a thin, flexible tube that ranges from 4-6 feet long.

A well-lubricated colonoscope is inserted into the anus and then is advanced slowly, into the rectum, through the colon and usually as far up as the cecum or terminal ileum.

At this point the colonoscope is slowly withdrawn. There is very little stimulation when the flexible tube is slowly exiting and you could reduce your Propofol infusion.

Air is usually pumped through the colonoscope to help clear the path or open the colon.

The physician views the procedure in real time video on the monitor. Instruments to remove polyps or take samples of tissues, biopsies and foreign body removal can be achieved through the scope.

**The Bowel Prep:  
**Remember these patients are probably dehydrated from their prep.  
Even if the IV is started in the Holding area, they are still not well hydrated.  
As soon as you get your patient into the room, you should place the NC with ETCO2 sampling on the patient to build up their FRC while you are connecting the other monitors. Some GI labs are very efficient, allowing little time between the patient entering the room and the start of the procedure.  
**Cardiac:** Watch for a vagal effect when air is insufflated into the patient’s colon.  
Arrhythmias from dehydration and a decreased SVR from Propofol are not rare.  

**Propofol syringes: United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter 797** regulations prohibit us to pre-draw up several propofol syringes for a few cases to save time. You may prelabel syringes to save time drawing up Propofol immediately prior to each case.

Lilley et al. showed that adding lidocaine to propofol emulsion increased the lipid droplet size and caused an oil droplet to form in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The addition of 10 mg of lidocaine to 90 mg of propofol also caused a time-dependent reduction of propofol concentration in the emulsion as propofol separated out to form an oily layer **(15)**. Despite these changes, Lilley et al. **(11)** suggested that the changes in droplet size with freshly prepared mixtures using up to 20 mg of lidocaine to 200 mg of propofol were unlikely to have clinically significant effects. **1**

  
  
**Airway Equipment  
**Age appropriate ETTs, airways, masks and blades  
LMAs  
Oral and nasal airways  
Baby safe mask device or Ambu bag  
Suction equipment with long enough tubing  
  
**Drugs:** The standard anesthesia drugs and pediatric emergency drugs.  
Anectine and atropine  
Propofol syringes with propofol tubing  
**Narcotics:** Not needed. MRI is painless.**IV Equipment:** A container of 22g IV catheters and essentials (ETOH swabs, tegaderm, tape, 4x4 gauze and a roll of elastic coband to wrap the IV to make it more secure. Have it available for the IV starter while you are mask inducing. Find out if contrast is needed and if a certain extremity is preferred.  
Primed IV tubing (usually 500cc bag with micro tubing) for each case

**Pre-op:** Most of these kids are given PO versed 10 minutes prior to rolling into the GI room.

**Anesthetic:** General TIVA or Total IV Anesthesia with a Propofol infusion.

We usually do not utilize a propofol pump because the cases are much shorter in duration than adults.  
**Induction:** Mask induction with Sevoflurane while MDA/CRNA starts a peripheral IV.  
After IV is established, remove mask and apply Salter ETCO2 NC. Start TIVA with propofol until the end of the case. Patient might require a jaw thrust/chin lift until all the Sevo has left their system. No ETT is necessary except in rare cases.  
Ketamine is not usually administered like adults. There are many different cocktails, but just propofol alone is very common with kids.  
We mix 5-10 ccs of 1% Lidocaine plain into our 30cc syringes and then draw up the 20ccs of Propofol into the same syringe. That helps minimize the painful sting of propofol being injected.  
**Stretcher:** Just like adults, the patient remains on the stretcher for this procedure.  
**Position:** Left lateral with their knees drawn up towards the abdomen. Pillow tucked beneath their head for cervical neutrality.  
It is good to start infusing the Propofol before the GI doc starts inserting a lubricated gloved finger into the anus to check for any abnormal masses or blockages. This is usually not desirable for an awake patient.  
**Bedside Meds:** Robinul, Atropine, Ephedrine and Anectine.

**Duration:** 15-60 minutes.

**IV Access:** 22G is acceptable.

**Emergence:** Stop propofol infusion when the GI doc is almost done.You can leave the patient on their side, remove monitors when you are comfortable and transport the patient to the recovery room.**  
Possible Complications:  
**Colonic perforation.  
Post-polypectomy bleeding.  
Postpolypectomy Electrocoagulation Syndrome.  
Infection  
Gas Explosion.  
cardiac arrhythmias.  
MI

**More Notes:**The doctor may have someone press on the abdomen or reposition the patient in order to advance the scope through the colon. This is more stimulating to the patient.

**Related Notes:  
Colonoscopic Tattooing**  
When a lesion requires “marking” for a later surgical removal or endoscopic follow-up, a permanent dye is injected to mark or ‘tattoo’ the colon adjacent to the lesion.

There is clear evidence that removing adenomas (polyps) during a colonoscopy reduces risk for colorectal cancer significantly.

A screening colonoscopy is recommended for anyone 50 years of age and older, and for anyone with parents, siblings or children with a history of colorectal cancer or polyps.
