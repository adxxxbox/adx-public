Blebs and Bullae – Excision     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### **EKOS Discontinuation**

This procedure is easier than the initiation because the catheter is being pulled after an angiogram to verify that the blood clot is gone.  
The patient’s SaO2 is usually WNL.  
The patient’s symptoms look much better from the initial insertion.

**Equipment:**  
Pressure tubing needed to connect to their line inserted by the doctor.  
A NC and ETCO2 sampling device.

**Pre–op Appearance:**  
The patient may be oozing from their IV sites from being hypocoagulated.  
Epistaxis is common.  
Do not start any new IVs unless absolutely necessary.

**Anesthetic:** MAC with ETCO2

**Position:** Supine and arms tucked. Bed rotated 90 degrees.  
Make sure your IV flows well when the IV arm is tucked.  
The surgeon may request Trendelenburg or Reverse Trendelenburg.

For a pulmonary angiogram, the doctor may utilize the right IJ to access the pulmonary vasculature. The patient’s head will need to be turned to their left; the patient’s neck is prepped and covered.

**Sedation level:** Do not over-sedate; the doctor will want the patient to take deep breaths with the contrast medium injection, like during an aortogram.

**C-arm:** Yes. You will need a lead apron.

**A-line:** Usually not. Don’t insert when hypocoagulated.

**EBL:** Minimal

**Foley Catheter:** Yes

**Duration:** 1 hour

The doctor will perform one angiogram, aspirate the remaining PE and pull the catheter.

The heparin drip and TPA should have been stopped prior to you receiving the patient.
