### Colon/Small Bowel Surgeries

**Methods:  
Laparoscopic**

**Hand Assisted Laparoscopic or HALs:** It’s laparoscopic, and near the procedure’s end, the surgeon makes one of the incisions a little bigger and pulls out the resected colon. The surgeon inserts a hand into the abdomen while pneumoperitoneum is maintained with laparoscopy.

**Open:** Big incision, open belly case. You need to hydrate and watch your fluids.

**Small Bowel Resection:** Part of the small bowel is resected and anastomosed.

Colectomies are classified according to the portion of the colon to be removed as well as the type of procedure used.

**Right Hemicolectomy:** When the right side of the colon or Ascending colon is removed.

**Left Hemicolectomy:** When the colon on left side or Descending colon is removed.

**Transverse Colectomy:** When the transverse colon is removed.

**Anterior Resection of the Sigmoid Colon**: The part of the colon next to the rectum, the sigmoid colon, is removed. This is done in steep Trendelenburg. The anastomosis for this procedure is more difficult for the surgeon because the resection site is deep in the pelvis. After removal of the diseased portion of the colon, the intestine is reconnected or anastomosed. The anastomosis may be either hand-sewn or stapled.

**Colectomy**: Usually done for colon CA. The part of the large bowel with cancer is removed, along with surrounding lymph nodes. The remaining bowel is then joined together via anastomosis.

**Abdominal Peritoneal Sigmoid Colon Resection**  
This operation is more involved than a Low Anterior Resection. Part or all of the sigmoid colon and the entire rectum and anus is removed. A colostomy is then performed.

**Pelvic Exenteration, also known as a Pelvic Evisceration….**When the rectal cancer is growing into nearby organs, a pelvic exenteration may be the only solution. This is an extensive operation.  Surgeon removes the rectum, bladder, prostate (in men), or uterus (in women) if the cancer has spread to these organs.
