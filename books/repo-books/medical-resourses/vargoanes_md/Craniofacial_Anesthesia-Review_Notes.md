### Craniofacial Anesthetic Considerations and Review Notes

**Assess the Airway Preoperatively**

Patients with maxillofacial imbalances may have eating difficulties, distorted speech,

Tempomandibular Joint dysfunction and breathing problems.

These procedures are performed by Maxillofacial Surgeons.

You need to ask the surgeon if he prefers a nasal or oral intubation. If an oral intubation

is planned, does the surgeon prefer an Oral Rae?

Have a Nasal, Oral and Oral Rae ET tubes available at sizes of 6.0, 6.5 and 7.0.

**Carefully assess the airway**

Will the patient possibly be difficult to mask ventilate?

Will you need the Glide scope or fiberoptic intubation?

**Usual Oral intubations (Avoid Nasal Intubation):**

Surgery in the frontal sinus or naso-orbital-ethmoidal area.

**Airway:**

Usually, these patients are young and healthy. However, he/she may have airway

problems. Consider an armored ETT. The surgery, the patient’s position and the patient’s

anatomy all may be factors causing airway problems.

Bleeding can be a major problem and can be reduced by avoiding hypertension.

Just like all other nasal intubations, use a Neosynephrine nasal spray (vasoconstrictor) to

reduce bleeding. Have the glide scope in the room in case it is a difficult intubation.

Find out if the jaw will be wired shut at the end of the case.

**Pre-op:** A dose of Decadron 0.1mg/kg will help to prevent postoperative swelling.

**Le Fort III fractures** (or cranial base dysfunction): Attempting to intubate nasally could

penetrate brain tissue.

Nasal, zygomatic or orbital fractures: Attempting nasal intubation can violate the cranial

vault.

**BP Maintenance:**

Keep the MAP around 60-70mmHg or within 20% of baseline because the face and skull

tissue are very vascular.

**Indications:**

Many of these surgeries are for patients with malocclusion (the misalignment of teeth and

jaw) due to cleft palate, midface hypoplasia (underdeveloped upper jaw, cheekbones,

nose, and eye sockets), and other upper jaw issues.

**Osteotomy:** The sawing or cutting of a bone.

**Prognathism:** One or both jaws project forward beyond facial alignment.

**Orthognathic surgery** is surgery to correct conditions of the jaw and face related to

facial structure.

**Le Fort Osteotomy**

Upper jaw surgery that involves sectioning and repositioning the maxilla or upper jaw to

correct its abnormal position.

**There are three types of Le Fort osteotomy:**

**Le Fort I Osteotomy:** Use an armored ETT. Surgery is for an Advancement or treatment

for upper jaw malocclusion and cleft palate.

**Le Fort II Osteotomy**: Treatment of upper jaw fractures.

**Le Fort III Osteotomy:** Treatment of mid-face problems and deficiencies.
