**Please Review NEC Notes**

**Pre-op**  
The neonate will be critically ill and possibly unstable, suffering from sepsis, hypovolemia with 3rd spacing, and a distended abdomen.. The goal should be to pre optimize wherever possible before surgical intervention.**  
  
What to Expect**  
**Gestation:** Almost always < 36 weeks  
**Weight:** 1-3kg (underweight)  
**Respiratory:**  
Awake or RSI if not already intubated  
  
May be intubated with vent settings per neonatologist  
  
High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) may be employed  
  
May have chest tube in place

**Access:**  
Peripheral IV and/or central venous catheter (CVC) already in place  
  
CVC may be unobtainable due to distended abdomen, peripheral shutdown  
  
Uterine arterial (UA) line often present

**Pressors:** May already be on  
Dopamine 3-5mcg/kg/min  
Epinephrine 0.05-0.2 mcg/kg/min

**Pre-op and Other Assessments**  
**Labs:  
ABGs-** may have metabolic acidosis. HCO3 replacement dose is  
0.2 x weight (kg) x base deficit.  
**Blood:**  
CBC/BMP/PT/PTT and ionized Ca – prepare iSTAT if available  
Ensure blood is available, with syringe pump to deliver to patient  
Citrate is poorly cleared by the neonatal liver, and it can accumulate after transfusion. It will bind serum calcium, with serious consequences for the neonatal hear.  
Keep hematocrit >35% by administering PRBCs and FFP in 110 ml/kg increments

**Urine Output:** Evaluate the amount of urine output to gauge intravascular volume (2 ml/ kg/h)  
Intraventricular hemorrhage: if present, can be worsened by wide swings in blood pressure. Keep patient within 20-30 mm/hg of baseline.  
  

**For Procedure in the NICU**  
TIVA is used as there is usually no anesthesia machine.

**Bring anesthesia cart with a few pre-drawn up meds:**  
**Muscle relaxant-** in a 1cc syringe-usually Rocuronium (0.25-0.5mg/kg)  
**Narcotic-** in a 1cc syringe-usually Fentanyl (20-30mcg/kg is common for TIVA)  
(See narcotic note below)  
We mostly use Fentanyl for TIVA, Use the meds you are comfortable with.  
**Emergency Drugs:** atropine, epinephrine

**Do not start case without blood immediately available** .

**IV Fluids:** Continue their dextrose containing IV fluids to prevent hypoglycemia, and piggyback anesthesia medications

High infusion rates of 20 ml/kg/h together with boluses of 5% albumin may be required as replacement fluid to maintain adequate circulating volume. A good urine output (2 ml kg/h) may reflect an adequate perfusion pressure and hence correlate with an increased survival from an episode of severe NEC.

**Albumin:** Treat hypotension with volume before pressors.  
  
**Blood bolus if needed:** 10mL/kg  
Blood loss needs to be replaced with blood, fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), and albumin. Coagulopathy as indicated by constant oozing at the surgical field requires platelets and FFP transfusion.  
  
**Extension tubing:** Connect to a 10cc syringe with a 3 way stopcock for drug boluses, as access to IV ports will be limited.  
**Back up airway equipment:** 2.5,3.0 and 3.5mm ETT, Miller blade  

**Temperature:** Patients are usually poikilothermic. Therefore body temperature monitoring and active warming measures, including a warm theatre, a forced-air blanket, and warmed IV fluids, are essential.

**Emergence/Extubation:** Keep neonate intubated postop in NICU

**Possible Complications  
**Hemorrhage - Intraoperative liver hemorrhage is a known lethal complication of NEC surgery and is especially seen in infants with lower preoperative mean arterial pressure and in those requiring larger fluid resuscitation before operation.  
Retinopathy of prematurity  
Metabolic Acidosis  
Sepsis  
Pulmonary Edema  
3rd spacing  
Hypovolemia

**HFOV**

HFOV may be utilzed when there is a failure of conventional ventilation due to severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE), or pulmonary hypoplasia; or to reduce barotrauma when conventional ventilator settings are high. HFOV uses a constant distending pressure (mean airway pressure \[MAP\]) with pressure variations oscillating around the MAP at very high rates (up to 900 cycles per minute). This creates small tidal volumes, often less than the dead space.

**Narcotic Note:**  
Preterm babies show an increased neuroendocrine response. Induction with a high dose of opioid (e.g. fentanyl 10 mcg/ kg body weight or an equivalent dose of remifentanil or sufentanil) helps blunt the systemic stress response that creates the postoperative catabolism and substrate mobilization. The surgical stress response lasts longer in preterm infants than in full-term babies and adults.

The neonate’s long-term exposure to narcotics and benzodiazepines for sedation can develop a higher tolerance therefore requiring higher doses.  
  
NICU sedation plus narcotic and paralytic is typically sufficient for surgery however, and inhalation agents can be avoided.
