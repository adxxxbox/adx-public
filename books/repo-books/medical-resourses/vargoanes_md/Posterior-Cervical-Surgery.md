#### Posterior Cervical Surgery (Prone or Sitting)-Discectomy, Decompression and/or Fusion

A surgical incision is made through the back of the neck posteriorly. With the posterior approach, the lateral exposure is not limited by the vertebral arteries. However, the positioning is twice as difficult.  
  
**Indications:** Cranial cervical decompression, severe stenosis, myelopathy and tumor.  
**Pre-op:** Asses the patient’s cervical ROM for a possible glide scope intubation.  Assess for existing paresthesias or deficits.  
**Duration:** 1-4 hours.   
**Positions (possibly 2):**  
1\. Prone with arms tucked; the head is sometimes flexed with the chin towards chest.  
2.  Sitting up with both arms flexed in.  
**Mayfield Pins are used for both cases.**  
**A-Line:** usually in the sitting up position.

**EBL:** Minimal; it just depends on the surgeon.   
**IV Access:** 2 IVs (20G is acceptable) if prone. A 2nd IV is common just in case there is an issue with the primary IV. This is one position you don’t want to have to start an IV while the arms are tucked. The sitting position also limits your IV access. Avoid starting an AC IV since the patient’s arms will be flexed inward over their abdomen.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT.  
I noticed that many experienced orthopedic CRNAs prefer an armored ETT (wire enforced). Flexion of the head will sometimes kink a non-reinforced ETT. Double tape the ETT.  

**Intubation: Use** the Glide Scope if there is a decreased cervical ROM. Keep the head neutral.

**Vent Settings:** Avoid PEEP and Nitrous Oxide.  
**Neosynephrine Drip:** Yes. Make sure it runs well immediately after the arms are positioned. For the prone position, everybody still worries about IOP.

  
**Mayfield pins and Propofol:** It is common for us to administer 50-100mg of Propofol or some Esmolol just prior to the surgeon screwing in the Mayfield pins because it is very stimulating to the patient. The BP can skyrocket in response to the initial stimulation.

**For the Prone Position for Posterior Cervical Surgery:**

A Jackson Operating Table is usually used because the table permits C-arm access.

2 IV’s and a reinforced ETT is common. Arms will be tucked.  
**BP Cuff Location:** Consider the nearest leg. Many times the BP cuff will give erroneous BP readings from the surgeon or scrub assistant leaning against it. Make sure your ventilator tubing is not pulling on the ETT. To maintain tubing slack, you can tape or rest the ventilator tubing on the section of the Mayfield frame that is right under the face.

**Log rolling the patient:** The surgeon will be at the head of the bed to maintain cervical neutrality by holding the Mayfield frame and pins when log rolling the patient from the stretcher. Make sure you have enough IV tubing slack. When log rolling the patient, you just worry about disconnecting and reconnecting the breathing circuit. Don’t forget to recheck for bilateral breath sounds. Immediately after the arms tucked, check the patency to your IV and Neosynephrine tubing. Don’t wait until it is too late.

Securing the pulse ox probe with tape is also a good idea. Once the arms are tucked and secured, it is difficult to get upper extremity access. 

**Sitting Up Position for Posterior Cervical Surgery:**

**Bed Rotation:** Yes, it is usually turned 180 degrees.

After the patient is placed in the sitting position, the surgeon will soon want to rotate the bed 180 degrees. Make sure the patient’s BP has not significantly dropped and don’t be afraid to start your Neosynephrine drip. Make sure you have enough slack for your IV and ventilator tubing prior to the bed rotation.  You could stretch out your ventilator circuit and move your ventilator closer.

You will now be at the foot of the bed. Position all your tubes neatly and secure your Doppler probe on the patient’s chest before the patient is draped.

**BP:** Avoid Hypotension.  
**NOTE:** The BP at the head level could be around 25% below the cuff pressure on your BP monitor cuff, since it is on the patient’s bicep. Arterial pressure is reduced 0.77mmHg for every 1 cm gradient above the heart. The vertical distance between the heart and head can be 22-90cm depending on the procedure. So there can be a relative difference in perfusion pressure between the brain and at the level of the heart.   
  
**Pre-Cordial Doppler:** YES.  
The precordial Doppler remains an essential first-line monitor in patients at risk for Venous Air Embolism. Accurate position is crucial to receive signals from the RIGHT heart structures. Most of us position the probe on the left parasternal border and adjust the probe by the clarity of the LV heart tones coming from the Doppler. Tape it on the patient’s chest. (See Doppler notes at the bottom)  
**VAE precordial murmur:** Mill wheel. 

**Emergence:** Consider a nasal or oral airway if you are extubating the patient deep. Avoid hyperextending the head post extubation. The patient may already have a C-collar, so most of us prefer an awake extubation. I have also seen many CRNAs safely perform deep extubations for these cases.

**Old Literature vs Latest Trends**

**TLC/CVP for RA access- in case of a VAE:** I have NEVER seen a TLC/CVP inserted for one of these cases.

**A-line:** Is not as common anymore, especially if the patient is young and healthy.  
 

**Possible Complications:**

1% chance of death from injury to the spinal cord.

5% chance of spinal fluid leakage, infection, bleeding, and hardware related problems.  
**Concerning Myelopathy:**  
Of all the patients with myelopathy, 40% get better, 40% stay the same, and 20% continue to deteriorate.

**More Notes on the Doppler Probe Placement:** 

Some literature recommends the Doppler probe placement between the third and sixth intercostal spaces along the RIGHT parasternal border. Some believe that a probe positioned on the left sternal border might fail to pick up the path of air bubbles traversing the right side of the heart.   
However, receiving clear Doppler heart tones can be difficult when using the right sternal approach. 

Despite the above theory, a study showed the left parasternal probe is at least as sensitive to clinical venous air embolism events as right parasternal placement.

A far left laterally positioning probe was tested and resulted in some false positive VAEs.
