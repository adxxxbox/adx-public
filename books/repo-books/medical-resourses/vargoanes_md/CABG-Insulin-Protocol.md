### Standard Insulin Protocol for CABG

Insulin Protocol: check level pre-op and Q 1 hour during surgery. Goal= keep below 150  
<110 no action  
110-150 3 units/hr, no bolus  
150-200 6 units/hr, 5 unit bolus  
200-250 10 units/hr, 10 unit bolus  
\>250 15 units/hr, 20 unit bolus

Use of continuous intravenous insulin to achieve and maintain an early postoperative blood glucose concentration less than or equal to 180 mg/dL (for atleast 3 days) while avoiding hypoglycemia is indicated to reduce the incidence of adverse events, including deep sternal wound infection, after CABG.  
  
Studies show keeping blood glucose level <140mg/dL has uncertain effectiveness.  
  
Measuring preoperative hemoglobin A1c concentrations may be helpful in assessing the adequacy of preoperative glycemic control and identifying patients at risk for postoperative hyperglycemia.
