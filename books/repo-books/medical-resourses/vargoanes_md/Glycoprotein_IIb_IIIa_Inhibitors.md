### Glycoprotein IIb IIIa Inhibitors

**Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Inhibitors**  
  
GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors are a class of platelet inhibitors which function by binding to and blocking GPIIb/IIIa receptors (fibrinogen receptors) on the surface of platelets.  
  
By preventing the GPIIb/IIIa molecule from interacting with fibrinogen, platelet aggregation is inhibited.  
  
These drugs DO NOT inhibit platelet activation, but do inhibit platelet aggregation.  
  
**GP IIb/IIIa Inhibitors:**  
Abciximab (Reopro)  
Eptifibatide (Integrilin)  
Tirofiban (Aggrastat)
