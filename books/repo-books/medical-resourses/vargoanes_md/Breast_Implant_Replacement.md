### Breast Implant Replacement

Breast implant replacement is an easier procedure than the original insertion.  
A pocket under or over the muscle will have already been created to hold the implants, so only minimal (if any) adjustments to the pocket will be needed when replacing. Patients usually report that they experience less pain after removal or replacement surgery. Scarring should also not be an issue as the plastic surgeon can make an incision in the same place as the previous incision.  
  
**How long do implants last?**  
Some will last a lifetime, while others have complications within seven years.  
The majority of implants last 10-20 years without complications.  
Recent FDA reports indicate that about 20% of women will have their **breast implants** repaired or **replaced** within 10 years of the original surgery.  
  
Because of radiation and thinner breast skin after mastectomy, implants for breast reconstruction tend more often to require exchange every 10 years.  
  
**Indications for breast implant replacements**  
Deflation (leak) of a saline implant.  
Rupture of a silicone gel implant.  
Capsule contracture.  
Asymmetry/breast deformity.  
Desire to change implant size.  
  
**Capsule contracture:** Induration and perhaps pain in the breast. The implant is not changing. Rather, the scar tissue envelope that forms around the implant thickens and contracts, causing the implant to feel firmer. Treatment involves re-exploring the breast, removing the scar tissue causing the problem and placing a fresh implant of the same type and size.  
  
**Anesthetic:** General/LMA is the most common; endotracheal intubation is rarely used.  
Intubation is frequently elected if the procedure involves placing the operating table in the sitting position so that the surgical team may evaluate symmetry.  
If the plan is to insert the implant deep to the pectoral muscle, muscle relaxation may infrequently be required.**Regional:** Not indicated.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** If the plan is to insert the implant deep to the pectoral muscle, muscle relaxation may infrequently be required.  
  
**Position:** Supine with arms abducted < 90%. Arms will be completely wrapped for stability. Because the head of the OR table will be elevated to the sitting position at various stages of the procedure, adequate slack must be provided in IV lines and arms must be safely secured.  
  
**Duration:** 60-90 minutes.  
**EBL:** < 40 ml.  
**IV Access:** 20g is acceptable.**A-line:** Not indicated.**Age Range:** Adults.**Hydration:** Normovolemic.**Emergence:** Deep LMA extubation is common; patients are usually healthy.  
  
**Risks and possible complications**  
Bleeding or hematoma.  
Iatrogenic injury or damage - new injury or damage to the tissue or implant as a result of implant surgery.  
Infection, including toxic shock syndrome.  
Necrosis - dead skin or tissue around the breast.  
Seroma - the collection of fluid around the breast implant.  
Lymphedema or lymphadenopathy.  
Inflammation or irritation.  
Redness or bruising.  
Capsular contracture - hardening of the breast area around the implant.  
Calcification in breast tissue.  
Chest wall deformity - chest wall or underlying rib cage appears deformed.  
Delayed wound healing.  
Extrusion - skin breaks down and the implant appears through the skin.  
Nipple or breast changes, including change in or loss of nipple sensation.  
Deflation of the breast implant-filler material leaks from the breast implant, often due to a valve leak or a tear or cut in the implant shell.  
Rupture of the breast implant - a tear or hole in the implant’s outer shell.  
Implant displacement or malposition - the implant is not in the correct position in the breast.  
Nipple or breast changes, including change in or loss of nipple sensation.  
Asymmetry - breasts are uneven in appearance in terms of size, shape, or breast level.  
Breast feeding difficulties.  
Breast pain.  
Breast - “ptosis”.  
Implant palpability or visibility- implant can be felt through the skin.  
Implant removal - with or without implant replacement.  
Implant visibility - implant can be seen through the skin.  
Implant wrinkling or rippling.  
Re-operation - additional surgeries.  
Scarring.  
Skin rash.  
Thinning and shrinking of the skin, also called “breast tissue atrophy”.  
Unsatisfactory appearance due to implant style or size.
