Aggrenox (aspirin/dipyridamole) reversal    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Aggrenox (aspirin/dipyridamole) Reversal

_Currently, there is a lack of specific antidotes for the growing number of new (novel) anticoagulants that are slowly replacing warfarin and heparin. For this reason, there is NO universal standard of care for the treatment of the anticoagulated bleeding patient when there is no specific antidote._

**Consult cardiology for ALL patients with coronary stents.**

**Quick Notes:  
**Dipyridamole is an antiplatelet agent that is no longer prescribed as a stand-alone drug, but now combined with aspirin to create Aggrenox.  
Discontinue drug 2 days prior to procedure-unless being treated for stents or CVD.  
  
Do NOT discontinue in patients treated for coronary or cerebrovascular disease – cardiology consult recommended for these patients.  
  
**Specific Antidote:** None  
  
**Bleeding or high risk surgery within 6 hours:** Consider platelet transfusion.  
  
**Dialysis:** Not likely to benefit.  
**Monitor:** Platelet factor assay (evaluate platelet function).  
  
Consider platelet transfusion (1 unit) for critical neurosurgery/eye surgery ONLY; usually not necessary.  
  
Recommend hematology consult.
