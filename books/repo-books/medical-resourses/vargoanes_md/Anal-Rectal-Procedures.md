### Anal Rectal Procedures

For anorectal procedures, limit IV fluids to less than 500cc unless told otherwise.  
Always ask the surgeon about limiting IV fluids. Difficulty urinating after anorectal surgery may occur due to spasm of the urinary sphincter resulting from pain due to the surgery. A full bladder can also contribute to rectal pain via pressure. This would NOT be good with an overhydrated patient. Many surgeons want you to limit hydration. Some patients actually need get catheterized in able to void. I have seen some protocols for these patients to have only a 500cc IV bag with micro drip tubing.  

**Possible Causes:** Hemorrhoids, Anal Fistula, Pilonidal Cysts, Condyloma, Rectal Prolapse, Rectal Abscess or foreign body.

The most important issue is to find out ahead of time what position the surgeon wants the patient to be in.  
Lithotomy or prone jack-knife? There is a difference in preparation

**If it’s lithotomy:**  
General/LMA or ETT and sometimes a MAC. With an Increased BMI, you may want to intubate. With patient’s legs up and pushing back on a big belly in a slight Trendelenburg – this becomes an aspiration risk. MAC cases are becoming more rare for these procedures.

**If it’s Prone Jack-Knife:**  
Most of the time we intubate. You will need a prone view device or large foamed pad to protect the face and the eyes. If it’s a general, you will be intubating the patient on their stretcher and log rolling the patient over on the operating room table to a prone position. Always recheck breath sounds after turning patient prone.

Some surgeons will request a MAC case and are actually pretty good at their local injections. Just be very careful what drug you administer prior to local injection. Prone / Jack-Knife is a position in which loss of an airway is difficult to get back. Have nasal and oral airways available. Consider 10-50mg of Ketamine if the local injection is not being tolerated. Some of my more experienced colleagues with give up to 0.5mg/kg. Consider a small dose of Robinul like 0.2 mg with higher doses of the Ketamine. Always give Versed if you plan on using Ketamine.

**Sphincterotomy:** Jack-Knife Involves treating mucosal fissures from the anal canal/sphincter.

**Anal Fistulotomy:** Usually Lithotomy  
Usually caused by a perirectal abscess, this is an abnormal connection from the rectum to the skin that bypasses the rectum. Surgery for anorectal fistulas also vary depending on the location, severity, and chronicity of the fistula tract.

**Excision of Pilonidal Cysts:** Jack-Knife position, prone.

**Rectal Prolapse or Rectal Abscess:** Lithotomy or Jack-Knife

**Foreign Body:** Usually lithotomy.  
Most of the time the surgeon with demand relaxation so you will have to intubate. Be careful dosing because these cases tend to be short.
