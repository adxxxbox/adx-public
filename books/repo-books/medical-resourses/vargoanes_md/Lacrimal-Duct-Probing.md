Lacrimal Duct Probing     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Lacrimal Duct Probing

Opening and enlargement of the nasolacrimal duct to correct epiphora, or excessive tearing out of the eye and not into the lacrimal duct. This procedure is done to open the valves between the nasolacrimal (tear) duct and the nose. The surgeon first dilates the puncta (the two little holes in the eyelid) with a tiny metal dilating tool. Then a thin, flexible probe is gently moved through the duct until it reaches the inner nose. Irrigation, or flushing sterile liquid through the duct, is done to make sure the duct is open and the blockage has been removed. Many of these cases are children.
