## Blood Transfusion and Review Notes

Failure by anesthesia and surgeons to recognize and appropriately treat hemorrhage in a timely manner may result in significant morbidity and mortality.

**Hemorrhage is expected in certain cases:**  
Major peripheral vascular procedures  
Cardiac surgery  
Liver surgery  
Radical cancer resections.

**Hemorrhage may be anticipated in**:  
Trauma cases  
Emergency general surgery procedures  
Major orthopedics  
Obstetrics

**Dilutional Coagulopathy (hypofibrinogenemia) and FFP  
**Microvascular bleeding during massive transfusions tend to occur due to the decrease in concentration of coagulation factors, decreased fibrinogen and an elevated PTT.  
This occurs if volume replacement is with red cells, crystalloid and plasma expanders, and insufficient infusion of FFP and platelets.

**Hypofibrinogenemia  
**Hypofibrinogenemia hemodilution from volume replacement and consumption by clot formation or as a result of disseminated intravascular coagulation.

**_Dilutional coagulopathy should be prevented by early infusion of FFP._**  
Dilutional thrombocytopenia and microvascular bleeding is common after 1.5-2.0 blood volumes have been replaced.

**Fibrinogen (Also known as Factor 1)**  
Fibrinogen is a critical protein for clot formation, providing a matrix and mesh network essential for clot strength. Maintaining fibrinogen levels is an important therapeutic target in bleeding patients, particularly in perioperative settings  
Early studies demonstrated that fibrinogen repletion corrected clot strength, based on viscoelastic blood testing using thromboelastography/thromboelastometry (TEG).

Following substantial blood loss and hemorrhage, hypofibrinogenemia occurs because of hemodilution, from volume replacement and consumption by clot formation or as a result of disseminated intravascular coagulation.

**You need to replace lost fibrinogen**  
We can replenish Fibrinogen with the administered cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrates.  
Fibrinogen is a critical protein for clot formation, providing a matrix and mesh network essential for clot strength. Maintaining fibrinogen levels is an important therapeutic target in bleeding patients, particularly in perioperative settings.  
Early studies demonstrated that fibrinogen repletion corrects clot strength, based on TEG studies.

**Fibrinogen level:** The normal range is 150 - 400 mg/dL or (1.5-4.0g/L)  
Fibrinogen levels are increased with pregnancy.

**Repletion of Fibrinogen**  
The most effective way to achieve fibrinogen replacement rapidly is by giving fibrinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate.  
(Cryoprecipitate or Fibrinogen concentrates are preferred over FFP for replacing fibrinogen)

**Cryoprecipitate has Fibrinogen**  
Early transfusing of Cryoprecipitate was associated with improved survival rate.  
Fibrinogen levels are decreased in injured patients on admission and are associated with poor outcomes.

**FFP for Fibrinogen Replacement  
**Transfusing FFP for fibrinogen repletion requires large volumes that may be helpful for patients with trauma-induced coagulopathy who are bleeding and require volume replacement  
A dose of 12.2 mL/kg increases plasma fibrinogen levels only 0.4 g/L, whereas 33.5 mL/kg increases levels by 1.0 g/L

**Fibrinogen or PT/PTT Levels Before Surgery**  
A fibrinogen (factor 1) < 1 g/l or a PT and PTT of > 1.5 times normal represents established hemostatic FAILURE and is predictive of microvascular bleeding.  
This is why the PTT should be maintained below 1.5 times normal as the minimum target.

**Early infusion FFP:** 15 ml/kg should be used to prevent this occurring if one anticipates a massive hemorrhage.

Established coagulopathy will require more than 15 ml/kg of FFP to correct.

**Ratio oft transfusing blood**  
1:1:1 ratio for the transfusion of PRBCs : FFP: Platelet administration should be attempted for the most severely traumatized patients.

**Minimal Platelet Levels**  
A minimum target platelet count of 75k is appropriate in this clinical situation.

**Type O Blood is the universal donor blood  
**In terms of time of availability, blood group O is the quickest, followed by group specific, then cross-matched blood.

Group-specific blood (Type O) can be issued without performing an antibody screen because it has no major antigens and can be given safely. O negative blood should only be used if blood is needed immediately.  
Only 8% of the population is O negative blood

O Negative for females is standard  
O Negative or Positive for males are standard

**Continue transfusing Type O blood with large transfusions**  
If 50-75% of the patient's blood volume has been replaced with Type O blood (approximately 10 units of PRBCS in an average sized patient), you should continue to administer Type O blood unless directed otherwise by your blood bank. At this point, there is a concern that the patient may have received enough anti-A or anti-B antibodies to precipitate a hemolysis Type A, B, or AB units are subsequently given.

Switching to a type-specific blood transfusion as soon as possible would spare the low supply of O-type blood and reduce the risk of a hemolytic transfusion reaction.

**TEG (Thromboelastography) vs PT, PTT and INR  
**TEG is becoming more standard  
TEGs correlate better with relevant clinical outcomes and provide faster results (within 10 minutes) at a comparable cost

**Anticoagulants and Hemorrhage**  
**Warfarin  
**If a patient is hemorrhaging while on warfarin, the warfarin should be immediately reversed with a prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and intravenous vitamin K (5–10 mg). The dose is dependent on the INR.  
**Heparin  
**Unfractionated heparin can be reversed with protamine (1mg protamine reverses 100u heparin).  
An excess protamine induces a coagulopathy.  
Common reversal dose of protamine for reversal is 25 or 50mg IV.

Low molecular weight heparin can be partially reversed with protamine.

**Direct Thrombin and Factor Xa Inhibitors  
**Fondaparinux  
Dabigatran  
Rivaroxaban

**Aspirin and P2Y12 antagonists  
**Patients taking aspirin have a low risk of increased bleeding as it can be reversed by a platelet transfusion.

**P2Y12 antagonists -** only partially reversed by platelets  
Clopidogrel (Plavix)  
Prasugrel  
Ticagrelor  
Cangrelor  
Elinogrel  
  
In massive bleeding, patients will have minimal circulating antibodies, so will usually accept group specific blood without reaction. If the patient survives, antibodies may develop at a later stage.

All blood components should be administered using a blood component administration set, which incorporates a 170-200 lm filter.

Although a special platelet giving set is ideally used for platelet transfusion, it is unnecessary in massive hemorrhage. The important issue is to administer platelets via a clean 170-200 lm giving set.

**Tranexamic Acid  
**Tranexamic acid inhibits plasminogen activation, and at high concentration inhibits plasmin.  
This drug is becoming popular for trauma protocols and hemorrhaging.  
A loading dose of 1 gram over 10 min followed by 1 gram over 8 hours is well documented for hemorrhaging patients in trauma protocols  
There are few adverse events or side effects associated with tranexamic acid use in the setting of massive hemorrhage.

**Cell Salvage**  
The use of intraoperative cell salvage can be very effective at both reducing demand on allogeneic supplies and providing a readily available red cell supply in massive hemorrhage.

In terms of time of availability, blood group O is the quickest, followed by group specific, then cross- matched blood.

Actively warm the patient and all transfused fluids.

Alert theatre team about the need for cell salvage autotransfusion.

Important to restore organ perfusion, but it is not necessary to achieve a normal blood pressure at this stage

**Further management**  
**Components** Component replacement should occur only in the presence of active bleeding or if interventional procedures are to be undertaken.

Platelet concentrates (1 pack/10kg) are given if platelet count falls below 50.  
Each platelet concentrate also provides around 50ml of fresh plasma.  
Fresh frozen plasma (12ml/kg) is administered if PT or PTT are running higher than 1.5 times control levels.  
Cryoprecipitate (1-1.5 packs/10kg) is given for Fibrinogen levels < 0.8g/l.

Combinations of stored whole blood, packed cells, colloids & crystalloids are given to maintain blood volume or pressure at adequate levels and hemoglobin at around 7g/dl or hematocrit at 25. Conserve limited supplies of fresh blood, plasma or platelets until the bleeding is controlled.

The blood bank will continue making packages every 35 minutes until patient is moved to ICU, patient expires, or surgeon calls off massive transfusion. All "packages" will be delivered within 35 minutes of the last delivered "package".  
All "packages" will contain six units RBCs with four units FFP. All even number "packages" will also contain a platelet product. All odd number "packages" starting with the third package, will contain a "ten-pack" CRYO pool.

**Transfusion Guidelines**  
**Plasma Transfusion (FFP)  
**Consider transfusion when rapid blood loss exceeding 100ml/min continues after transfusion of crystalloids, colloids and 4u RBCs.

Transfuse after loss of one circulation blood volume when PT, PTT, and fibrinogen  
cannot be obtained in time.

Transfuse 10-15 ml/kg of FFP rapidly (this corresponds to 1000ml of plasma, or units of FFP).

Established coagulopathy will require more than 15 ml/kg of FFP to correct. The most effective way to achieve fibrinogen replacement rapidly is by giving fibrinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen is unavailable.

It takes 35-45 minutes to thaw and transport 4u FFP.

**Cryoprecipitate Transfusion  
**Fibrinogen deficiency develops early when plasma-poor RBCs used for replacement. Fibrinogen <50mg/dL strongly associated with microvascular bleeding.  
If fibrinogen <80-100mg/dl, cryoprecipitate indicated even if bleeding no longer profuse.  
Aim for fibrinogen >100mg/dL.  
Transfuse 1 pack/10kg body weight.

**Platelet Transfusion Notes  
****Platelets Transfusions and fluid warmers (Literature varies)  
**The AABB (formerly known as the American Association of Blood Banks) recommends against infusing platelet transfusions through a blood warmer.  
However, Konig, Yazer and Waters documented that platelet functionality is not decreased after warming with a fluid warmer.  
I have seen many anesthesia providers transfuse platelets with or without a fluid warmer.

When transfusing platelets, some literature states NOT to use a filter that was previously used for transfusing PRBCs because it may cause the platelets to stick to the red cells and therefore reduce the effective transfused platelet dose. Despite the literature, it is very common to transfuse all blood products through the same tubing/filter system.

On the achievement of surgical hemostasis, do not let platelets fall below 50,000 mm3 in acutely bleeding patients.

Target of 100,000 mm3 recommended for patients with multiple high-energy trauma or CNS injury.  
  
Platelet count of 50,000 mm3 can be anticipated when approximately 2 blood volumes have been replaced with plasma-poor RBCs.

Platelets are quickly lost through wounds until surgical hemostasis obtained.

Platelets requiring pooling and transport require up to 45 minutes.

Short-term coagulation goals: Hct >20-24%

Platelets >50,000 mm (>100,000 for CNS injury or multiple high energy trauma) Fibrinogen >100mg/dL  
PTT<45 sec  
PT<18 sec

**Long-term coagulation goals:**  
Hct > 24%  
Platelets >100,000mm  
Fibrinogen>150mg/dL  
APTT<40 sec  
PT<17 sec

**Definition of Massive Blood Transfusion  
**Replacement of one entire blood volume within 24 hours.  
Replacement of 50% of the total blood volume within 3 hours.  
Transfusion of >10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) in 24 hours  
Transfusion of >20 units of PRBCs in 24 hours  
Transfusion of >4 units of PRBCs in 1 hours when on-going need is foreseeable

**Hemorrhage and Lawsuits  
**Malpractice claims associated with hemorrhage had a greater severity of injury than other claims, with over three fourths resulting in death. The anesthesia care was more often assessed as less than appropriate and a payment made more often to the plaintiff in hemorrhage claims compared with other claims.  
Payments were greater for hemorrhage claims (median $607,750) than for other obstetric and surgical claims ($276,000).
