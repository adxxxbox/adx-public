Splenectomy (open and laparoscopic)   

### Splenectomy (open and laparoscopic)

  
_Edited by Brian Del Grosso, MS, CRNA_

**General Review:**  
The surgical removal of the spleen. These can be done laparoscopically or open. If the spleen is not enlarged, laparoscopic is preferred.  
**  
For open procedure**  
A midline abdominal or left subcostal incision is made, the spleen is mobilized by dividing the lateral peritoneal attachments while the spleen is retracted medially. The short gastric vessels are clamped and ligated, the splenic artery and vein are exposed, then clamped and ligated (note: if the operator doesn’t have a good hold of the splenic hilum here, there can be a large amount of bleeding. This is also the area where the pancreas can get injured). The spleen is then removed. Accessory spleens (incidence of 15-30%) should be looked for if the splenectomy is being done for a hematolgic disorder. They are found along the cephalad and cuadad edges of the pancreas behind the stomach, and in the area of the gastrohepatic ligament, greater omentum, and the splenic hilum. The larger the spleen, the more accessible circulating blood volume will be removed with the splenectomy if the artery and vein are transected simultaneously.

**Indications for Splenectomy**  
Hereditary spherocytosis  
Traumatic splenic rupture (incidence of 45%)  
Hereditary elliptocytosis,  
Sickle cell anemia (common in african Americans, usually need splenectomy for sequestration)  
Splenic vein thrombosis  
Echinococcal cyst  
Splenic abscess  
Certain eukemias  
Certain lymphomas  
Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP): ITP is an autoimmune disorder with destruction of platelets within spleen. Platelet transfusion therapy doesn’t work until spleen is removed. These patients are usually on chronic steroid treatment.

**Preoperative Considerations**

**Labs:  
**A CBC with diff  
CMP and reticulocyte count for patients with splenic pathology.  
All patients should be type and crossed (this is a type of case that there is potential for massive blood loss).  
  
**For ITP patients**  
Transfusing platelets for thrombocytopenia preoperatively does NOT work. Their spleen will just consume the platelets. However, platelets can be transfused after the splenic vein is ligated. Patients with severe anemia may require blood transfusion with the exception of patients with congenital hemolytic icterus to avoid hemolytic crisis.

**Preoperative Medications  
**Many ITP patients are on long-term steroids.

Steroids should be continued perioperatively to avoid adrenal insufficiency.  
Solu-Cortef: 1-2mg/kg to prevent adrenal insufficiency.

**Anesthetic:** General/ETT

**Induction:** Most patients will come with an IV, however, if not, inhalation induction is used. Use caution with pressure on mask, cricoid, as well as performing your laryngoscopy to avoid bleeding.  
**Muscle Relaxation:** Most surgeons will prefer paralysis during dissection and removal of the spleen to avoid any unnecessary trauma to vital organs.

**Nitrous Oxide:** Avoid to prevent bowel distention.  
**Position-Open** : Supine with reverse Trendelenburg and a slight tilt to the light.  
**Position-Laparoscopic:** Sometimes supine, but usually lateral.

**Duration:** 1-2hrs  
**IV Access:** 2 large bore IVs (appropriate for age/weight for Peds) incase of a hemorrhage.  
**A-line:** Consider it  
**Central line:** Only if the patient has limited access, you are concerned about blood loss, or the possibility of hemodynamic instability. Discuss with surgeon prior.  
**Age range** : Usually > 5 years  
**Hydration:** Follow standard 4:2:1 rule.  
**(below is just a common reference)**

Albumin dose for mild hypotension: 10cc/kg is recommended (<10kg wt)  
Albumin-more effective with its oncotic pull than crystalloids (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 5-10cc/kg (<10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus dose for mild hypotension: 20cc/kg (>10kg wt)  
Crystalloid Bolus (emergency) for severe hypotension (20-50cc)

**Replacement of Insensible Fluid Loss (reference)**  
Minimally invasive (inguinal, laparoscopic) 0-2 cc/kg/hr  
Mildly invasive (ureteral reimplantation) 2-4 cc/kg/hr  
Moderately invasive (simple bowel cases) 4-8 cc/kg/hr  
Significantly invasive (NEC) >10 cc/kg/hr  
**3rd Spacing:** 10mL/kg/h is standard for 3rd space fluid loss  
with an open belly case.

**EBV (reference)  
Premature:** 90-100cc/kg**Newborn:** 80-90cc/kg**3mo-1 year:** 70-80cc/kg**1-4 years:** 70cc/kg  
**Adult:** 55-60cc/kg

**EBL:** Minimal-100cc (has potential to be much greater) Discuss with surgeon prior the need for cell saver, do EBV calculations prior to case, make sure blood products are readily available.  
**Emergence:** Most patients are extubated and transferred to a progressive care unit or ICU for overnight then to floor bed.

**Intraoperative Considerations:**

Always consider the possibility of changing from laparoscopic to open. Bleeding is the main reason for changing from laparoscopic approach to open approach. Other considerations would be splenomegaly in which the spleen was too large to remove safely complete laparoscopy. The rate of conversion to open is as high as 5% and increases as the degree of splenomegaly increases.

**Post operative Considerations:**  
**Possible Complications:**  
Hemorrhage  
Pancreatitis  
Subphrenic abscess  
Wound infection  
Perforation of a hollow viscus  
Pleural effusion  
Pneumonia  
Pneumothorax in the instance of diaphragmatic injury  
Thrombocytosis leading to DVT  
Portal vein thrombosis  
Bleeding  
Wound infection (less risk in children vs adults)

Complication rate for the laparoscopic approach are 15% versus for an open approach are at 26%.  
Pulmonary, wound, and infectious complications were all less for the laparoscopic approach, however, the rate of bleeding complications was higher in the laparoscopic approach.  
  
Patients are at risk for “Overwhelming Post-Splenectomy Infection” (OPSI) secondary to no longer having protection against encapsulated bacterial infection - _Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenza,_ and _Neisseria meningitidis_.

The absence of IgM antibody to these organisms can lead into the development of overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI). The younger the patient undergoing splenectomy the higher the risk of developing OPSI, with OPSI being most common in children less than 5 years of age. The risk of these infections can be decreased by postponing splenectomy, until the patient is 5 years of age or older, and making sure the patient receives appropriate vaccination against encapsulated organisms, at least ten days before the procedure. These vaccinations include polysaccharide pneumococcal (PCV-7 and PPV23), conjugate _Haemophilus influenza_ type b, and polysaccharide meningococcal. PPV23 should be given starting at age 2 and PCV-7 should be given based on a normal vaccination schedule.  
  
In addition to immunization, children post-splenectomy are started on prophylactic antibiotics to avoid OPSI. Penicillin 125 mg twice a day until age 3 and then Penicillin 250 mg twice a day for two years minimum is an appropriate regimen.
