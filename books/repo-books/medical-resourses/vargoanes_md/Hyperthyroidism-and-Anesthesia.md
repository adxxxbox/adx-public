Hyperthyroidism and Anesthesia     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Hyperthyroidism and Anesthesia

The goal is for the patient to be clinically euthyroid and to be already on Anti-thyroid drugs.  
Antithyroid meds take 2-6 weeks to take affect.

Make sure the patient gets his or her anti-thyroid and beta-blocker meds in the a.m. Beta blockers like propranolol are used to control sympathetic nervous system hormonal release but also to decrease the conversion of T4 to T3.

Lugol’s Iodine (5% KI) for 1-2 weeks pre-op or Na Iodide 500 mg IV q12h.  
Radioactive iodine kills thyroid cell function.

**Procedure Tips**

Give Versed and be generous!

Hyperthyroid Meds may slow the time of induction.  
Increases in MAC may be required.  
Increase your inhalation agent because of the increased CO.  
The rate of drug metabolism may be increased.  
MAC increases 5% for every 1 degree above 37 degrees.  
Hyperthyroidism-induced hyperthermia may also increase the MAC.  
Regional Anesthesia is also a good choice because it blocks the SNS-but be careful with Epinephrine.  
Robinul has less of a chronotropic effect than atropine does.  
Consider an Esmolol drip.

Give corticosteroids if the patient has been on them.

Don't use ketamine or Pancuronium because it increases SNS outflow.  
Thiopental has antithyroid activity in high doses.

Chronic thyroid patients are usually vascularly dry and prone to a large drop in BP with induction.

**Thyroid Storm: Can look like MH**  
Only 1-2% of patients with hyperthyroidism develop a thyroid storm.  
We rarely witness a thyroid storm because he/she is almost always medically managed before surgery; nicely beta blocked with a resting HR <85.

Classically, a thyroid storm can occur 6-18 hours post-op.  
 

**Signs of a Thyroid Storm**  
Pyrexia  
Sweating  
Dehydration  
Hypoglycemia  
Ketosis  
Tachycardia  
Arrhythmias  
Cardiac failure  
Occasional hypotension.  
Nausea and vomiting  
Diarrhea  
Abdominal pain  
Restlessness, confusion and delirium.

  
**Treatment:**  
O2  
Cooling blanket  
IV fluids  
A-line  
Sedation, respiratory support as required.  
Beta-Blockers, steroids, Na iodide (1-2 g IV/day) and antithyroid drugs.
