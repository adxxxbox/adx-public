### Epidural

An epidural is a procedure whereby drugs are injected through an epidural catheter which has been inserted into the epidural space.   
An epidural is also form of regional anesthesia, which reduces sensation and pain as it blocks the nerve roots coming off the spinal cord.  
A continuous infusion of a local anesthetic from an epidural pump can be applied for  
pain relief for days as needed. This is a major advantage in post-operative thoracic and other large incisional procedures.**Epidural** – also known as a continuous lumbar epidural (CLE) in obstetrics, is achieved by injecting a local anesthetic in the space around the dural sac (epidural space). Epi meaning over-on top. So on top-over the dura mater.  
Injecting a local anesthetic or opioid will penetrate the thick dura mater and diffuse into the spinal nerve roots exiting the spinal cord at and near the point of injection. This produces a reversible loss of sensation and motor function. Epidural anesthesia requires larger amounts of local anesthetic than a spinal anesthetic.  
  
Epidural anesthesia is versatile and can be administered by a single injection or through a catheter. The use of a catheter allows the anesthesia provider to add local anesthetics, narcotics and additives during labor extending duration beyond delivery if needed for analgesia. This also permits a slower dosing to effect, avoiding too-rapid development of block and especially sympathectomy.  
  
Epidural anesthesia can be combined with a spinal (Combined Spinal Epidural-CSE). The spinal is for immediate relief. _See Combined Spinal-Epidural Anesthesia_ It is important not to use an epidural anesthetic in patients who are hypovolemic or severely dehydrated. Patients receiving an epidural anesthetic should be well hydrated and receive at least 0.5-1 liter of crystalloid solution, such as ringers lactate, immediately prior to the block. Epidural anesthesia has a higher rate of failure for surgical procedures in the perineal area.  
  
Lower lumbar and sacral nerve roots are large and there is an increase in the amount of epidural fat which can affect local anesthetic penetration and subsequent blockade. This phenomenon is known sacral nerve sparing. Close attention to the total dose is required to avoid toxicity.
