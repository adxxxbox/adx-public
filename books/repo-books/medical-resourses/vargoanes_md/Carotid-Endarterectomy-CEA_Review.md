### Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA) Review

A prophylactic operation that involves removal of plaque from within the carotid artery that is likely to lead to future stroke. Much of the plaque forms at the fork where the common carotid artery divides into the internal and external carotid artery.  
The plaque causes severe stenosis that can lead to TIAs and CVA. Through a small incision in the neck, the surgeon opens the carotid artery and removes the atherosclerotic plaque form inside the artery. The surgeon then closes the carotid wall. Most surgeons patch the artery with a graft.

**Indications:** Symptomatic or asymptomatic severe internal carotid artery stenosis.  
**Anatomy of common carotid artery (CCA)**  
Left CCA originates from the aortic arch  
Right CCA originates from the innominate artery  
The CCA divides into the Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) and External Carotid Artery (ECA) at the level of the C3/C4 disc space.

**Carotid Sinus Baroreceptor and BP Alterations.**  
Baroreceptors are stretch-sensitive and respond to changes in BP. They are located in the carotid sinus (at the bifurcation of external and internal carotids). When the arterial wall is stretched inward or outward, they send an increased or decreased nerve firing to the medulla. The carotid sinuses are innervated by the sinus nerve of Hering, which is a branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX cranial nerve). The glossopharyngeal nerve synapses the medulla.  
A sudden decrease in arterial pressure, actually results in a DECREASED nerve firing, which triggers the medulla to INCREASE SNS outflow and decrease PNS outflow thus increasing BP. During a CEA, there can be massive BP swings due to carotid wall tension changes from manipulation of the bifurcation or carotid clamping.  
The Eversion CEA requires division of the carotid artery, and as a result, the longitudinal fibers of the carotid sinus nerve are transected. This decreases nerve firing to the Medulla causing an increased in sympathetic outflow causing increased BP in the PACU.  
However, the removal of atheromatous debris, and reconstruction of the carotid artery may increase tension on the carotid sinus baroreceptor, increasing thus decreasing the BP. **Risk of Stroke:** The 30-day stroke rate around 1%.  
Stroke can be a result of a dislodged piece of plaque or cerebral ischemia from prolonged clamping.  
**Patch angioplasty versus primary closure:** Most surgeons recommend patch closure over just suturing the artery back closed (primary closure)

**Results with Patch Closure:**  
A reduction in the risk of ipsilateral stroke in the perioperative period.  
A reduced risk of perioperative arterial occlusion.  
Decreased restenosis during long-term follow-up  
**Stump pressure:** Stump pressure is rarely monitored anymore despite it being in many textbooks.  
After clamping the proximal common and external carotid arteries, a needle attached to a transducer is introduced into the common carotid artery to obtain a waveform. Mean pressures greater than 30 to 50 mmHg imply adequate collateralization via the circle of Willis down the ipsilateral carotid artery. Lower stump pressures are an indication for shunt placement and higher pressures are associated with stroke rates <0.5 percent.  
**EEG monitoring:** Only used with general anesthesia. A neuro tech monitors the tracings for cerebral ischemia as indicated by the presence of theta and delta waves or disorganized rhythms that indicate the need to unclamp or shunt.  
**Bilateral carotid stenosis:** Some patients have varying degrees of bilateral carotid disease. We only surgically repair one at a time.  
Studies show that bilateral carotid occlusive disease appears to increase the risk for complications during and after unilateral CEA.  
The combined death and stroke rates in these patients were almost twice that of matched patients with unilateral disease (5.6 versus 2.4%).  
**Aspirin:** Lower dose aspirin (81 to 325 mg daily) reduces the risk of stroke with CEAs. For patients who are allergic or sensitive to aspirin, Plavix can be used as an alternative agent.  
**Statins:** In symptomatic patients undergoing CEA may be associated with improved outcomes.

**Prophylactic antibiotics:** Usually Ancef. It is recommended prior to incision to control surgical site infection due to the use of a prosthetic graft.

**Anesthesia:** General, Awake MAC or Deep Cervical Block.  
Almost always a General with an ETT. Some surgeons still do MACs and ask the patient to count forward and backwards while clamped.  
Agitation, slurred speech, disorientation, and extremity weakness are indications for cerebral ischemia for shunt placement during these awake cases. Slurred speech is the easiest indicator.

The available evidence suggests that the choice of anesthetic technique has no significant impact on clinically important outcomes after CEA.

**Carotid Shunting:** The shunt is placed after the vessel is opened and prior to the endarterectomy. If its general anesthesia, some surgeons place a carotid shunt while others use EEG monitoring to guide the need for shunt placement. For awake CEAs, when the patient slurs you know its time to shunt or unclamp.  
**Removing the Plaque:**  
The plaque is consistently found at the carotid bifurcation and the origin of the internal carotid artery. Its freed and removed from the layers of the deep media. Great care is taken to create a smoothly tapered transition between the endarterectomized portion of the artery and its normal distal extent.  
**Heparin and Protamine:** Heparin is given before clamping. Protamine is given after the carotid is patched. Studies show the reversal of heparin with protamine was associated with a lower incidence of serious bleeding requiring reoperation 0.64 vs 1.7% compared with no reversal.  
**Assessing brain perfusion:** Although 80 to 85 percent of patients tolerate clamping well, we still want to assess collateral circulation via the circle of Willis to ALL patients who do not undergo mandatory shunting when clamped. EEG monitoring is the most popular method.

**Methods for predicting or assessing brain perfusion:**  
Verbal when awake  
Transcranial Doppler  
Somatosensory evoked potentials  
Raw electroencephalographic (EEG)  
Processed EEG monitoring  
Carotid stump pressure  
Jugular venous oxygen saturation and others.

**Carotid shunting:** For any patient who demonstrates evidence of cerebral ischemia by any of the monitoring techniques above.  
Shunting should be performed expeditiously. A temporary shunt is placed beyond the proximal and distal extent of the arteriotomy from the common to the internal carotid artery. Blood flows through the shunt providing continuous cerebral perfusion during the procedure. Neurologic reassessment is then performed.  
Although some surgeons prefer to use carotid shunts routinely to avoid the need for intraoperative neurologic monitoring, it should be recognized that shunting is unnecessary in approximately 90 percent of patients.

**The Risks of Carotid Shunting:**  
Formation of an intimal flap during shunt insertion, resulting in arterial dissection.  
Dislodgement of plaque emboli during vessel manipulation.  
Air embolism due to bubbles in the shunt.

**Advantages of Routine Carotid Shunting:**  
Surgeons who routinely shunted their patients have lower stroke rates during CEAs in patients with contralateral carotid occlusion compared with those who have selectively shunted. The higher rate of stroke amongst practitioners who selectively shunted may be attributable to a lack of familiarity with the procedure. Other groups have also reported a higher rate of shunting in patients with contralateral carotid occlusion.

Cerebral flow is assured with a properly placed shunt without need for neurological monitoring.
