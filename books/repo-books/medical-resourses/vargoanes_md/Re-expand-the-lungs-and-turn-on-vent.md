### Re-Expand the Lungs then Resume Mechanical Ventilation

The surgeon will request re-expansion of the lung. This is done manually with an inspiratory hold no more than 20cm. The surgeon will request resumption of mechanical ventilation. To avoid hyperexpansion of the lungs, (use a lower tidal volume with a higher rate). The new LIMA graft could be disrupted by repeated contact with over-inflated lungs.
