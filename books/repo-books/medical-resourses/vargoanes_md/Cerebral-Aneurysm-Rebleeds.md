### Cerebral Aneurysm- Re-bleeds

The cerebral aneurysm has a weak area in a blood vessel wall that causes the blood vessel to bulge or balloon out and sometimes leak or rupture. It may cause a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) or a hematoma.  
When a rupture occurs, the risk of death is 40%, and the risk of disability is 80%. If a patient successfully makes it to the hospital after the initial rupture or bleed, the following emergency measures may be applied:  
Decrease and maintain BP; always insert an A-line.  
Intubate/hyperventilate  
Sedation  
Possible lumbar drain—remove CSF  
Mannitol is administered. Ask the neurosurgeon when he wants it given before induction.  
All of the above are to prevent brain herniation and death from uncontrolled intracranial hypertension (ICP). If the above methods are successful, the worst is usually not over. There is a good chance of a re-bleed within the first 14 days that could cause death.

**The Re-bleed**  
This re-bleed is usually more severe than the first hemorrhage, causing neurologic deterioration and possibly death. The mortality of a second hemorrhage rises precipitously with significant morbidity in the surviving patients. Late re-bleeding is fatal in 67% of cases.  
  
**Rebleeding Facts: (varies with literature)**  
A 4% chance of re-bleed within the first 24 hours post-op.  
A 20 -30% re-bleed within 30 days.  
A 50% risk of another at 6 months, and then decreases to 3% per year for up to 15 years.  
During the next 5 months after the initial SAH, 10% to 15% of patients will re-bleed.

So, timing of surgery is important; usually within 72 hours of the first bleed.
