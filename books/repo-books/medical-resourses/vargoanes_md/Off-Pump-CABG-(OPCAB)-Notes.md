### Off Pump Coronary Artery Bypass (OPCAB) Notes and Facts

Doing a CABG on a beating heart in the absence of bypass. From utilizing an epicardial stabilizer, interrupting coronary blood flow and inverting the heart vertically causes hemodynamic instability. Hemodynamic changes occur rapidly and unexpectedly.

Many find that OPCABs are more stressful than a regular on pump CABG (ONCAB). 

**Advantages of OPCAB**

Decreased post-op complications of the following:  
Systemic inflammation  
Myocardial injury  
A-Fib  
Bleeding  
Kidney dysfunction and cerebral injury

  
**_There are multiple sudden massive BP drops when the surgeon manipulates the heart._**

**Reasons for temporary hemodynamic instability**  
Tilting and mobilizing the heart to reach posterior vessels: the Circumflex Artery and Posterior Descending Artery.

**What happens when the heart is tilted vertically?**  
It compresses the very thin RV wall against the septum, which restricts the diastolic filling and obstructs the RV outflow tract.  
When pulled or placed vertically, the blood flow from the atria has to flow upward against gravity into the ventricles. The atria increase their size and their filling pressure and can become larger than the ventricles, contributing to the reduction in cardiac output.

If the mitral and tricuspid valves are leaky, it will regurgitate flow and engorge the atria and pulmonary veins. OPCABs are contraindicated if patient has regurgitating valves.

**When the heart is tilted vertically, the result is often:**  
Reduced SV and MAP  
Increases in CVP and RVEDP  
Can decrease coronary blood flow 25-50%.  

A stabilization system is used for full exposure of some vessels and it restricts regional wall motion either by suction or by mechanical compression.

Good communication between surgeon and the anesthesia provider is very important.

Unnecessary fluid loading could cause adverse clinical outcomes, such as acute heart failure.

TEE should be considered in guiding fluid management during OPCAB surgery. Routine use of TEE in OPCAB has often led to changes in the planned procedure or the case being converted to an ONCAB.  
The stabilizer itself may induce regional defects in TEE scans.

You still give Heparin and monitor ACTs just like a regular heart.

Most surgeons approach the LAD without mobilizing the heart.

**Cheng et al., 2005,** found that OPCAB provided no significant improvement in mortality, stroke, peri-operative MIs or renal failure compared to ONCAB (On Pump CAB).

**However, OPCAB significantly decreases:**  
Incident of A-Fib  
Blood transfusions  
Inotrope requirement  
Respiratory Infection  
Ventilation time  
ICU and hospital length of stay and costs

Conversion from OPCAB to ONCAB is reported to be from 1-20%.  
Conversion to CPB has been shown to increase morbidity and mortality with operative mortality ranging from 8.5 to 18%.

  
 IABP therapy can be helpful with severe hemodynamic instability.

During distal anastomosis you want to maintain hemodynamic stability, to reduce the myocardial oxygen consumption.  Maintaining an MAP >70 mmHg allows an adequate coronary perfusion. Maintain SVO2 > 70% for cerebral perfusion.

Prophylactic use of Beta blockers reduces the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation. V-tach, V-fib or complete AV block may develop during coronary artery occlusion.  
 

The AV block commonly occurs during the right coronary artery occlusion as a consequence of the interruption of blood flow to the AV node. The surgeon may insert a small shunt to eliminate this.
