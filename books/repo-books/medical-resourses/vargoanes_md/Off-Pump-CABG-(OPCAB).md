### Off Pump Coronary Artery Bypass (OPCAB)

**_Warning: there are multiple sudden massive BP drops when the surgeon manipulates the heart._**

This is about doing a CABG on a beating heart in the absence of bypass.  
The worst part of this case is when there are multiple sudden massive BP drops. During the case, the surgeon has to mobilize and tilt the heart to achieve full exposure. Such mobilization can reduce SV, BP and increases CVP and right ventricle (RV) end-diastolic pressure. A decrease in coronary blood flow of 25-50% has been documented.  
Because hemodynamic changes occur rapidly and unexpectedly, we routinely have a vasodilator and vasopressor/inotrope ready for immediate infusion. Neosynephrine, Levophed, Milrinone and Nitroglycerine are common.

**Distal Anastamosis is the worst part**  
The worst part of the case is the period of distal anastomosis. After the surgeon selects the first distal vessel, he places a silastic tape around the vessel to produce a proximal coronary occlusion. This occlusion could lead to heart failure and cardiac arrest. It helps to run many cardiac outputs. The cardiac index (CI) can drop as low as 0.7L/min/m².  
During distal anastomosis when the CI <1.5, you can give epinephrine 10-20 mcgs to avoid progressive heart failure. Maintaining a cardiac output is more important than systolic BP.

**Colloids:** It is popular to load them with 500cc of Hespan or a bottle of albumin before the patient is heparinized.  
  
**3 Possible reasons for large drops in BP**  
Vertical displacement (tilting) of the heart when exposing the posterior descending artery can restrict regional RV wall motion by mechanical compression.  
Cardiac compression from the myocardial stabilizer.

Temporary myocardial ischemia during coronary artery occlusion for anastomosis.

  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT  
**Induction:** Drugs and type depend on whether or not you are fast tracking with a quick extubation as an end goal.  
Etomidate or Propofol are common.  
Fentanyl: 7.5-10mcg/kg  
Sufenta: 0.5-1.0mcg/kg  
Propofol drip: depends on the facility  
**Muscle Relaxant:** Avoid Pavulon if you are doing a Fast Track.

**Drips/Meds**  
**Inhalation Agent:** Usually Forane. Desflurane for Fast Track.  
**Nitroglycerine:** Use this for lowering the BP during placement of the partial aortic clamp and prior to suturing the distal anastomoses.  
**Neosynephrine:** Use when the MAP remains low due to reduction of SVR in order to avoid large fluid administration.  
**Calcium Channel Blockers** : a Cardizem drip is sometimes used to prevent post op vasospasms when multiple arterial grafts are used.  
**Dopamine:** Sometimes used.  
**Milrinone:** More commonly used.  
**Norepinephrine (Levophed):** Common but a ‘last resort’ drug in many CRNAs opinion.  
**Epinephrine:** to get a 4mcg/mL bag, I just mix 1 mg of Epi in a 250cc bag and draw from it. 10-20 mcg are given immediately to avoid progressive cardiac failure.  
**Lidocaine:** 1-1.5mg/kg bolus  
**Lidocaine Drip:** 2-3mg/min, some places use it for right coronary artery grafting.  
**Magnesium:** 2 gram bolus is usual dose.  
Both Lidocaine and Magnesium are given prophylactically prior to the distal anastomosis. The surgeon will tell you when to give it, so have it ready. This should help prevent dysrhythmias during manipulation of the heart and coronary occlusion.  
**Heparin:** 1.5-2mg/kg  
**ACTs:** Keep >300 secs (during vessel anastomosis).  
**Esmolol:** To treat tachycardia  
**Insulin Drip:** Use sliding scale

**Sodium Bicarbonate:** For pH < 7.30  
**Bolus Meds in a Syringe Available:**  
**Neosynephrine** 40-80mcg/mL (10mg vial of Neo in a 250mL bag is 40mcg/mL)  
**Ephedrine:** 10mg/mL.  
**Epinephrine:** 4mcg/mL. Give immediately to avoid heart failure if unresponsive to Levophed. See above paragraph on how to prepare it.  
**Potassium:** Keep > 4.0mmol/L  
**CaCl:** 1 gram available

**TEE:** Yes, for guiding fluid management. The TEE has often lead to changes in the planned procedure or converted to going on bypass. However, it becomes difficult to obtain useful information while the heart is retracted for many of the distal anastomosis.

**EKG changes:** Frequently shows low voltage, which does not display present myocardial ischemia. Watch for ST changes closely during the coronary occlusion with the distal anastomosis.

**  
Goals:**  
**Maintain BP** > 110/60mmHg with MAP > 70mmHg, which is needed for adequate coronary perfusion.  

TEE is usually used for guiding fluid management.

**Preload:** Keep them full (well hydrated) with crystalloids /colloids to maintain PCWP and CVP. This is the opposite of an On Pump CABG. During this procedure we tend to keep the patient slightly dry. Keeping them well hydrated helps alleviate the reduction in preload that occurs when the heart is retracted.

  
**Heart Rate:**  
Try to keep between 70-80 bpm.  
Tachycardia: Treat with Esmolol  
Prophylactic use of beta blockers reduces the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation.

Ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation or complete AV block may develop during coronary artery occlusion from the interruption of blood flow to the AV Node. A small shunt into the coronary artery can be inserted to prevent this.

  
**Hand Ventilation of Anesthesia bag:  
**The surgeon may request for you to temporarily hand ventilate (or even stop) for optimal exposure during distal anastomosis, especially when the marginal branch of the left circumflex artery is involved.

**Bed Positioning:**  
**Reverse Trendelenburg and tilted or rotated to the right. Right side down.**  
This is so the surgeon can optimally visualize the LAD, diagonal, and circumflex vessels.

**Reverse Trendelenburg and tilted or rotated to the left. Left side down.**  
Again, this is for an optimal view of the distal right coronary artery territory.  
Trendelenburg positioning to 20° head down appears to be an efficient technique to improve preload and increase cardiac output.

**Keep Warm:** Use a circulating-water mattress and a Bair Hugger. Fluid warmers should also be used. Remember, there is no bypass machine to warm the blood.

**Contraindications to OPCAB (Reasons to convert to ONCAB) when the chest is open:  
**Deeply buried LAD or other coronary vessels.  
Mitral Regurgitation that would need repairing.  
Profound unresponsive hypotension.  
Presence of dense ascending aortic calcification that precludes aortic side clamping.  
New extensive regional wall motion abnormalities.  
Complete cardiovascular collapse.

Conversion from OPCAB to ONCAB is reported to be from 1-20%.
