### Amiodorone (Cordarone) Notes

50 mg/ml (3 ml vials).  
  
900mg/500 ml glass bottle (1.8mg/ml) is used for maintenance dose. Obtained from Pharmacy.  
  
**Caution:**  
May cause hypotension with concurrent alpha blockade. In the event of breakthrough ventricular fibrillation, the bolus may be repeated at 150mg over 10 minutes (15mg/min).  
  
**Dosage Forms:** Liquid, solution or tablets (200 mg and 400 mg).  
  
**Hospital indications:** IV for treatment of ventricular arrhythmias, VF/VT, or frequent PVCs.  
  
**Pharmacology of amiodorone:**  
Class of drug: Class III antiarrhythmic agent.  
Used in the treatment of a wide range of cardiac tachyarhthmias, relaxes vascular smooth muscle. Reduces peripheral vascular resistance (afterload) and thus can cause hypotension. Slightly increases cardiac index.  
Prolongs phase 3 of the cardiac action potential in both atria and ventricle without altering resting membrane potential (RMP). Shows beta blocker-like and calcium channel blocker-like actions on the SA and AV nodes Increases the refractory period via sodium- and potassium-channel effects Slows intracardiac conduction of the cardiac action potential.  
  
**Mechanism of Action** (the antiarrhythmic effect):  
Prolongs the myocardial cell action potential (phase 3) duration and refractory period via Na channels. Acts as a noncompetitive alpha and beta adrenergic inhibitor.  
  
**Toxicity:**  
Rare side effects: hepatitis, exacerbation of asthma and CHF, and pneumonitis.  
  
**Biotransformation / Drug Metabolism:**  
Metabolized in the liver via CYP2C8 (under 1% unchanged in urine), and can affect the metabolism of numerous other drugs.  
Its major metabolite, desethylamiodarone (DEA), also has antiarrhythmic properties.  
Grapefruit juice can inhibit metabolism, elevating serum levels.  
  
**Contraindications:**  
Allergy to amiodorone or iodine. Cardiogenic shock. Bradycardia. Second- or third-degree AV block except in the presence of a functional rhythm management device. Resembles thyroid hormone, and can cause hypo- or hyperthyroidism.  
Alters thyroid function in 2-4% of patients with chronic use.  
  
**Adverse Effects:**  
Decrease in BP with initial infusion (given too fast).
