Thymectomy for Myasthenia Gravis (MG)     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Thymectomy for Myasthenia Gravis (MG)

The thymus is an anterior mediastinal organ and is part of the endocrine system. The role of this two-lobed organ prior to adolescence is for the processing and maturation of thymocytes, which become T-lymphocytes and are released into the circulation. They then populate the lymphoid organs for storage until needed. Removal of the thymus as an adult has little immediate effect on the immune system, as its role has been completed. The procedure is the same, but the anesthesia is much different.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune neurologic disease that results when the thymus, a normally dormant gland in the chest begins producing antibodies.

The symptoms may include droopy eyelids; double vision; weakness in the face, neck, arms and legs; and/or difficulty in swallowing.  

Most experts agree that removing the thymus gland improves the course of the disease by reducing or eliminating the symptoms. However, improvement may take months or years.

**Thymectomy Indications:** Tumors of the thymus gland.

Myasthenia Gravis (MG).  
  
The strongest association between thymectomy and an improved clinical course has been seen in female myasthenics with systemic weakness.

  
**_You need to find out ahead of time if you will need a double (DLT) or single lumen ETT! It all depends on the surgeon’s approach- if he needs you to drop the right lung or not. For a cervical approach, a DLT is not usually required._**  
  
**Incision:** Cervical Approach or Sternotomy. More recently thoracoscopic thymectomy has been introduced as a less invasive technique as an alternative to conventional trans-sternal approach not requiring a DLT.

A sternal saw is used to divide the sternum completely. The trans-sternal approach is the most-often used approach for removal of a thymoma.

An incision is made from 1-2 cm below the sternal notch extending to the 3rd or 4th intercostal spaces. The manubrium is divided to the level of the third or fourth interspace. The nearby structures for the surgeon to avoid are: Phrenic nerve, pericardium, and innominate vein. Hemorrhage is rare, but still a very possible complication.

**Warning with MG Patients**:  
Associated factors needing prolonged Post Op ventilation: FVC < 40 mL/kg.  
History of MG > 6 years.  
Major surgery COPD MG at Grade III or IV  
When the patient is taking >750 mg of Pyridostigmine daily to control their MG symptoms.

**Classifications of MG:** grade I – only eyes affected.

grade IIa – mild generalized MG responding well to therapy.

grade IIb – moderate generalized MG responding less well.

grade III – severe generalized disease.

grade IV – myasthenic crisis requiring mechanical ventilation.

  
**Pre-op Sedation:** Patients should continue their anticholinesterase medications until the morning of surgery. MG patients may have little respiratory reserve. Depressant drugs for pre-op meds should be used with caution. Sedation is avoided in patients with bulbar symptoms. The use of regional or local anesthesia seems warranted whenever possible.

**Anesthetic:** General with DLT or a single lumen ETT. Depends on the surgeon’s approach. Most are sternal with a DLT to drop the right lung.

**Thoracic Epidural:** Yes, it is used for postoperative pain control with minimal or no opioid use.

**Induction:** Propofol and deep inhalation with Sevoflurane.  
**Muscle Relaxants: Anectine:** Avoid **NDMR:** Avoid or give 1/10th the dose that you would give a patient of the same weight.  
**IV Access:** Usually 1 large bore incase of a rare bleeded.  
**A-Line:** Not as popular anymore-especially with experienced surgeons on a transcervical approach. I have seen surgeons request an A-line on the on the right or left arm.  
A-line on the left arm is preferred as intermittent compression of the innominate artery throughout the operation may lead to false determinations of a low blood pressure.

  
**Muscle Relaxant Reversal:** Controversial. Some argue that the presence of anticholinesterases and antimuscarinics will confuse efforts to differentiate any weakness due to inadequate neuromuscular blockade reversal from a cholinergic crisis in the recovery room. Some prefer spontaneous recovery and extubation when the patient has demonstrated adequate parameters for extubation (head-lift, tongue protrusion).

**TIVA:** Highly suggested (Propofol/Remifentanil).

**Inhalation Agents:** Sevoflurane; give a deep anesthesia with a volatile agent alone in patients with myasthenia may provide sufficient relaxation for tracheal intubation as well as most surgical procedures.  
**Narcotics:** Use a Short acting opioid only if necessary. Some recent grads I have met or worked with seem to think they cannot do an anesthetic without 2 mg of Dilaudid given at the end. NOT TRUE! Forane is an anesthetic; Sevo and Des are anesthetics.

**Steroids:** Hydrocortisone should be administered to those on long-term corticosteroid therapy.

**Duration:** 1-2 hours.

**EBL:** 50-100 mLs.

**Possible Complications:**  
Phrenic Nerve Injury  
Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury  
Pneumothorax  
Hemorrhage  
Mediastinitis

**Other Notes and Facts** Only 7.4% of MG patients after a thymectomy will require mechanical ventilation.

As many as 60% of patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia are believed to be likely to experience problems with residual activity of skeletal muscle relaxants. This is called PORC. PORC is postoperative residual curarization.

Most early onset MG patients can be treated successfully with thymectomy.

If the thymoma or a thymus tumor is found, a full sternotomy with an en bloc resection is recommended. A thymectomy may lessen the severity of MG symptoms, but the degree varies among patients. Most MG post thymectomy patients experience fewer flare-ups, require less medication and have a higher chance of complete remission.

Most patients with MG have some thymic abnormality: hyperplasia is found in 70% to 80% and a thymoma in 10% to 15%. A Thymectomy is indicated for treatment of both non-MG associated and MG-associated thymoma.

Individuals with myasthenia gravis have about a 30% cure rate and about 75% gain a significant reduction in symptoms.

Excellent hemostasis is recommended, especially in patients who have undergone plasmapheresis.
