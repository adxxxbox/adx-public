### Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulator Implantation for Obstructive Sleep Apnea

Also called upper airway stimulation or a "pacemaker for the tongue."

The stimulating device (with battery) and breathing sensor are implanted in the chest and connected to a stimulation lead that touches the hypoglossal nerve.

**Warning:** Some insurance companies, including Medicare, do not reimburse this procedure unless the patient's preoperative body mass index (BMI) is less than 35 kg/m².

Hypoglossal nerve:

The Hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII) is a motor nerve that starts in the brain stem and goes down through the neck and comes up again over the tongue.

It provides motor control for the muscles of the tongue and aids in important voluntary and involuntary functions, such as swallowing.

![image42](image42.png)

**Indication:** When patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with pharyngeal obstruction who have failed or cannot tolerate CPAP.

OSA occurs when the tongue and other soft tissues relax and obstruct the airway during sleep.

Hypoglossal nerve stimulation during sleep can prevent the tongue from relaxing and obstructing the airway.

The stimulation improves airway patency by mimicking muscle behavior that occurs during wakefulness.

Hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HGNS):

HGNS works by stimulating the hypoglossal nerve, which in turn stimulates one of two genioglossus (tongue) muscles to protrude the tongue anteriorly, preventing airway obstruction.

In the supine position, when the tongue becomes relaxed, it falls posteriorly and can block the airway.

This causes airway obstruction as seen in OSA.

**Note:** It also helps stiffen the walls of the airway, helping to prevent pharyngeal collapsibility.

Device Activation:

Using a small handheld remote controller, the patient turns the device on when going to sleep and turns it off on arising.

Surgical procedure comprises: (not necessarily in order)

Three incisions

Insertion of EMG electrodes into the genioglossus and hyoglossus muscles

Placement of stimulation lead

Verification of tongue response to stimulation

The stimulation lead is subcutaneously tunneled into a "pocket" that accommodates the implantable pulse generator (IPG).

Placement of IPG

Placement of the respiratory sensing lead

Tunneling of sensing lead to IPG (may be stimulating)

Verification of sensing

Closure of incisions

The IPG's electronics and battery:

Both are sealed inside a titanium case.

The connector module on top of the IPG attaches to the sensing and stimulation leads.

Both leads are tunneled to reach the IPG.

Three components of the device:

**Stimulating lead:** Implanted in the submental region on the terminal branches of the hypoglossal nerve.

**IPG:** Anterior chest wall

**Sensing lead:** Planted either in the 5th or 6th intercostal space between the internal and external intercostal muscles

Subcutaneous pocket:

A subcutaneous pocket is created for placement of the IPG in the right anterior chest wall superficial to the pectoralis muscle (as in a cardiac pacemaker implantation).

The IPG can be titrated per patient comfort

Anesthesia and surgical concerns:

_Consider reviewing "OSA and Adult Anesthesia" in the Coexisting Diseases and Surgery app._

The procedure requires general anesthesia.

Under anesthesia, three surgical incisions are made in the right neck and chest area.

**EMG monitoring:** Yes, electrodes are placed.

**General anesthesia:** Use a short-acting muscle relaxant for neuromonitoring purposes.

**ETT:** NIMs, reinforced or regular ETT-surgeon preference.

GlideScope for proper placement if the surgeon requests a NIMs ETT.

ETT should be taped to the left side of the mouth (opposite the working side).

**Eye protection goggles:** Yes

**Note:** The neck incision is usually made on the right side with the head turned to the left.

Position the vent tubing and monitoring cords away from the right side of the neck.

**Shoulder roll:** Usually

Arms tucked

**Bite block or gauze:** Some surgeons may request a pediatric bite block or a gauze roll to prevent the patient from biting.

**Position:** Supine, arms tucked.

Some surgeons will request the bed to be rotated 90 to 180 degrees away from the anesthesia machine.

Find out ahead of time because you may need a tubing extension.

A positioning cushion or wedge may be placed under the right half of the chest to better visualize the area where the respiration sensor is to be placed.

**Duration:** 1-2 hours

**EBL:** Minimal

**Emergence:** Awake extubation

Be cautious and avoid a chin lift, as one of the incisions is located directly under the chin.

Documented postoperative adverse events

Temporary tongue weakness < 1%

Swallowing or speech related < 1%

Incision discomfort 1%

Discomfort device 2%

Stimulation-related discomfort 8%

Hematoma and seroma

Infection

More notes:

The two leading manufacturers:

Inspire Medical Systems (FDA approved 2014)

ImThera Medical (LivaNova®) is still in clinical trials.

Inspire therapy criteria (established by the FDA):

22 years of age or older (some exceptions for Down syndrome)

OSA with an AHI (apnea hypopnea index) range of 15-65 per hour

25% or fewer central apnea events

Must have tried and failed CPAP

Appropriate anatomy (absence of obstructive tonsils, etc.)

Have undergone an endoscopy during drug-induced sleep to evaluate the pattern of airway collapse.

This procedure is typically performed in the doctor's office using a small infusion of propofol or remifentanil, combined with a nasal endoscopy.

The airway collapse is videotaped. The procedure is very brief.

**A patient with a complete anterior-posterior (AP) collapse** at the palate is a good candidate.

**A patient with complete concentric circular collapse** at the palate is NOT a suitable candidate.

**MRI compatibility:** No, but approved for extremity MRI

The device should not be within the magnetic field.

**Projected battery life:** 11 years
