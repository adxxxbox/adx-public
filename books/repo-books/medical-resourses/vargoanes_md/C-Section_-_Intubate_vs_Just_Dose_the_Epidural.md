### C-Section-Intubate vs Just Dose the Epidural

There are some complications to labor that just don’t permit you the time to draw up and bolus an epidural and possibly wait a few minutes for the block to set in, nor would you want the hypotension that could accompany the epidural bolus.  
  
There are also some labor complications that you do not want a conscious patient being awake, stressed out and yelling while everyone else is trying to stay focused and calm.  
  
It is a lot more convenient, safe, and controlled to intubate an emergency C-section patient just prior to incision versus during the middle of the case while dealing with unstable hemodynamics.

**Amniotic Fluid Embolism (EFE)  
Urgent C-section with potential massive hemorrhage

Prolapsed Cord  
Profound Fetal Bradycardia  
Maternal Hemodynamic Collapse  
Eclampsia or mother actively seizing  
  
There is no gold standard for “decision to incision” (this term means the time it takes you to make incision from the time the decision was made for a C-section).  
  
The national average and long standing recommendation is less than 30 minutes.  
  
In animal studies, fetal hypoxia occurred in 5-6 minutes of total cord occlusion and the fetal animals that were resuscitated after 15 minutes of cord occlusion suffered neurologic injury.  
  
Also, of note, one study found a 30 min decision to incision time did NOT correlate with negative fetal outcomes when the decision for C-section was fetal intolerance to labor.  
This further demonstrates the provider needs to know the reason for the C-section so they know how quickly to respond.  
  
For example, a rural provider is taking call from home and receives a call that there will be a  
C-section for maternal failure to progress, fetal tracing is WNL.  
The anesthesia provider knows this is not drastic and will have time to brush his/her teeth, change into scrubs and respond within the 30 minute time allotted by the hospital policy.  
An anesthesia history/physical and consent is obtained. The L&D staff wait for the OR crew to arrive and open the room at that time. An instrument count is conducted before the patient enters the OR.  
However, the same provider receives a call there is a STAT C-section related to complete placental abruption. The anesthesia provider instructs the L&D nurse to move the patient to  
the C-section room, hook patient up to monitors, and rushes to the hospital in whatever clothes they are wearing. They respond as quickly as they can safely get there. The L&D nurses open the room and a count is not performed.  
  
A post-op x-ray will be done before the patient leaves the OR.  
The anesthesia provider arrives just as the patient has been prepped and draped; they are briefed on history and allergies as they are drawing up induction drugs.  
  
They induce anesthesia, and as soon as the patient is intubated and ETT placement is verified, the surgeon cuts. Communication with the surgeon is key. He will be standing with the scalpel in hand waiting for you to announce he can cut.  
  
Both of the above scenarios describe after-hours response to a c-section without an in-house call crew, but the anesthesia provider and nurses respond in very different ways. If you get a call for a C-section and they do not tell you the reason, ASK!
