### Walking Epidural (Ambulatory Epidural)

Today, probably 99% of medical facilities no longer permit their patients to ambulate with any epidural due to liability issues.  
  
The walking epidural involves a combined spinal epidural (CSE). The spinal dose may be a low dose opioid analgesia followed by a very dilute (low concentration) epidural local anesthetic solution and a narcotic. A walking epidural dose only numbs the mother’s abdominal nerves and preserves motor function. This enhances comfort and allows the mother to walk around the delivery room in early labor. Once the labor progresses and the pain worsens, the epidural is dosed appropriately and can no longer ambulate. Once a patient’s membranes have ruptured, most hospitals will not permit the patient to get up and walk due to potential cord prolapse.  
  
Not all mothers who have the walking epidural walk around, but they do feel more comfortable maintaining their motor strength.  
  
Today, there are still many anesthesia providers who administer a walking epidural dose for the early part of labor, but do not permit the patient to ambulate. Your goal for all laboring epidurals should be to provide analgesia and preserve motor function so the mother can push.  
  
**_Note: Even an intrathecal injection of narcotic alone, without local anesthetic, can cause impairment of proprioception, which makes ambulation a questionable practice where patient safety is concerned.  
  
_Walking Epidural Doses There are a variety of possible walking epidurals doses. Just a few are listed below:  
**1\. 8 ml of preservative-free normal saline with 100ug fentanyl via epidural  
0.0625% bupivacaine with 0.5 mcg/ml sufentanil at a rate of 6ml/hr  
  
**Chuck Frisch CRNA  
**I administer 0.2% Ropivacaine with Fentanyl 2mcg/mL at 5 mL/hr with a 5mL bolus Q10 minutes up to 4h. They rarely have any dermatome level just a tightness during contraction. Their legs rarely get numb; if so it's usually one sided so more likely the catheter is on that side. I rarely have to top it off. In fact, one doctor I work with likes us to turn it to 2 cc/hr during actual delivery so they have more effective pushing.  
  
**Seth Long CRNA  
**We use 0.15% Ropivacaine with 2mcg/ml Fentanyl. I usually bolus 10 ml and run an infusion at 10-13ml/hr.  
  
**Advantage of a walking Epidural  
**Some literature states that ambulation and mobility promote contractions and therefore labor. Ambulating may also decrease pain, shorten labor, and decrease use of forceps and vacuum extraction.  
  
Many walking epidural patients have stated that having the ability to move is very important to emotional and mental health during labor.  
  
Many patients do not prefer to ambulate, but just want to rest.  
  
One patient stated that her legs felt tingly and numb, but she could still feel the pressure of the contractions, move her legs, and push effectively with no tearing.
