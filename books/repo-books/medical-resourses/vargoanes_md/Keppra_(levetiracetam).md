Keppra (levetiracetam)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Keppra (Levetiracetam)

Second generation antiepileptic.  
  
**Anesthetic concerns:** Keppra as largely replaced Dilantin (phenytoin) as the anticonvulsant of choice during craniotomies.  
It has less side effects and drug interactions than other anticonvulsants.  
  
**Mechanism of antiepileptic effect:** Unknown  
  
**Indications:  
**Partial onset seizures  
Myoclonic Seizures In Patients With Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy  
Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures  
  
**Dose:  
Popular intraoperative adult dose:** 1 gram IV and infuse over 15 minutes.  
500 mg, 1 gram or 1.5 grams.  
  
No dose adjustment necessary for patients with hepatic impairment.  
  
**Dosing Adjustments for Adult Patients With Impaired Renal Function**

| Group | Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) | Dosage (mg) | Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Normal | \>80 | 500 to 1,500 | Every 12 h |
| Mild | 50-80 | 500 to 1,000 | Every 12 h |
| Moderate | 30-50 | 250 to 750 | Every 12 h |
| Severe | < 30 | 250 to 500 | Every 12 h |
| ESRD patients using dialysis | \----- | 500 to 1,000 | Every 24 h |

  
Following dialysis, a 250 to 500 mg supplemental dose is recommended.  
  
**Precautions with Keppra**  
Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Keppra, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication and may cause behavioral abnormalities and psychotic symptoms.  
  
**Withdrawal Seizures:** Keppra must be gradually withdrawn.  
  
**Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to levetiracetam.  
  
**Most common adverse reactions:  
**Asthenia  
SomnolenceHeadache  
Infection  
Dizziness  
Pain  
Pharyngitis  
Nervousness  
Rhinitis  
**Drug Interactions  
Interactions with other drugs are minimal.** Keppra circulates largely unbound (<10% bound) to plasma proteins; clinically significant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are therefore unlikely.  
  
**Pregnancy Category C:** There are no adequate and controlled studies in pregnant women.  
Levetiracetam blood levels may decrease during pregnancy  
Levetiracetam is also excreted in breast milk.  
  
**Plasma half-life:** 6-8 hours.  
It is increased in the elderly (primarily due to impaired renal clearance) and in subjects patients with renal impairment.  
  
**Metabolism**  
Keppra is not extensively metabolized in humans.  
The major metabolic pathway is the enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group, which produces the carboxylic acid metabolite, ucb L057 (24% of dose) and is not dependent on any liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.  
The major metabolite is inactive in animal seizure models.  
  
**Clearance:** Decreased in patients with renal impairment and is correlated with creatinine clearance.  
  
**Excretion:** Kidneys  
Risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.  
  
**Elimination**  
Keppra plasma half-life in adults is 7 ± 1 hour and is unaffected by either dose, route of administration or repeated administration.  
It is eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion as unchanged drug which represents 66% of administered dose.  
The total body clearance is 0.96 mL/min/kg and the renal clearance is 0.6 mL/min/kg.
