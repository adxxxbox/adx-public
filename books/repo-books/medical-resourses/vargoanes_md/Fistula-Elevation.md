A-V Fistula Elevation Procedure (FEP)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### A-V Fistula Elevation Procedure (FEP)

Anesthetic concerns are the same for an AV Fistula, except this procedure is too surgically invasive for a MAC.  
\- After the initial AV Fistula is created, up to 50% still fail to mature.  
\- Most of the time, the failure is because the vein is too deep or torturous to be accessed.  
\- So, the surgeon will go back in and expose the AV Fistula and elevate it to make it closer to the surface.  
\- This will make it more superficial and accessible for dialysis needle cannulation.  
\- Unfortunately, the incision is much larger resulting in more stimulation than the original procedure.  
  
**Your biggest concerns:  
The last time the patient was dialyzed** and what is their preset serum K+ level.  
\- Most of these patients were dialyzed the day before so they could be hyperkalemic and hypovolemic.  
  
These patients usually have a permacath for dialysis access and should not be hyperkalemic.  
  
**\- Be aware of the most recent K+:** Because these patients may be hyperkalemic, hypervolemic or volume-depleted.  
\- As a result of sedation, the patient may HYPOventilate while maintaining adequate oxygenation without a change in SaO2.  
\- The body compensates for the respiratory acidosis (even if it’s minor) by exchanging H+ ions for K+ at the cellular level, and now their K+ has increased even more.  
\- This may result in hyperkalemia-induced cardiac side effects (PVCs, V-Tachy, etc.).  
**  
Accepted K+ levels for this procedure:  
**\- It depends on the situation and the clinician’s comfort levels.  
\- It is not uncommon to proceed with serum K+ levels of 5.2-5.9 meq/L.  
\- It is very rare to proceed with a serum K+ > 6.0 meq/L.  
\- The higher the K level, the less sedation should be applied.  
\- Assess for PVCs.  
**Anesthetic:** General/LMA or ETT, sometimes regional.**Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**Other Concerns:** These patients usually have other comorbidities. PVD, DM and of course, ESRD.  
**Diagnosis:** ESRD  
**Position:** Supine with surgical arm out on an arm/hand table, and the bed rotated 90 degrees for the surgeon.  
**Antibiotics:** Usually cefazolin (Ancef®)  
**EBL:** Minimal  
**IV Access:** 20G is acceptable.  
  
These patients often have difficult IV access.  
Sometimes you may have to go with a 22G or consider their feet.  
Remember, you can’t insert an IV on the surgical arm.  
  
**Possible Complications:  
**Bleeding  
Infection

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Na Bicarbonate | 50-100 mEq over 10 min | IV | 5-10 mins | 1-2 hours |

**Mechanism of action:  
Calcium:** Immediate resting membrane stabilization  
It does not promote the intracellular shift or elimination of K+.  
**Na Bicarbonate:** Shifts potassium intracellularly.  
**Notes:** Calcium chloride is more irritating to the veins than calcium gluconate.
