### Heart Transplant Immunosuppressant Facts

You should know some of these because all immunosuppressive drugs now in use have significant side effects that may have a direct impact on anesthetic and perioperative management

Always check labs for renal and liver function.  
**Cyclosporine or Tacrolimus**  
Cyclosporine and Tacrolimus are metabolized in the liver through the cytochrome P-450 system. So many of our anesthesia drugs may affect cyclosporine or tacrolimus blood levels.  
Complications of Cyclosporine or Tacrolimus are generalized motor seizures. Avoid hyperventilation (HYPOcarbia) because the patient’s seizure threshold may already be lower and promote seizure activity.  
**Renal Effects:** May cause a dose-related decrease in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, due to renal vasoconstriction.  
May cause thrombocytopenia.  

Hyperkalemia and Hypomagnesemia may be present with cyclosporine or tacrolimus therapy.

**Azathioprine**  
Major side effect is bone marrow suppression, and the drug dose may require adjustment for leucopenia or thrombocytopenia.    

**Antithymocyte globulin (ATG)**

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided because of the risk of adverse interactions (e.g., gastrointestinal hemorrhage, nephrotoxicity, hepatic dysfunction).
