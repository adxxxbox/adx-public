### Precurarization with a Nondepolarizing Muscle Relaxant

Precurarization:

-   An anesthetic technique involving the administration of a small, non-paralyzing dose of a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug (NMBD) prior to giving a paralyzing dose of succinylcholine.
-   It is used to prevent or reduce the side effects of the succinylcholine.
-   This is rarely practiced among anesthesia providers

The terms "**Defasciculating dose,**" "**Precurarization**" and “**Priming dose**” are used synonymously in a variety of literature.

-   **Precurarization (priming) dose:** 10% of the ED95 of the NMBD.
-   This dose will rarely produce a measurable neuromuscular effect.
-   **Documented priming dose of rocuronium:** 0.06-0.1 mg/kg

Dose timing interval between the NMBD priming dose and succinylcholine:

-   The recommended time between the two drugs is around 2-5 minutes (literature varies).
-   Realistically, most anesthesia providers never wait that long, which may lead to a variation of results.

Possible goals/results of precurarization:

Preventing fasciculations:

-   SCh is known to cause involuntary muscle contractions, or fasciculations, right before muscle paralysis sets in.
-   Precurarization works by occupying some of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction.
-   This partial blockade prevents the widespread, simultaneous muscle contractions that cause fasciculations.

Reducing post-operative myalgia (muscle pain):

-   The violent, involuntary fasciculations can lead to myalgia after surgery.
-   By blocking the fasciculations, precurarization also reduces the incidence and severity of this muscle soreness.

Reduction of succinylcholine-induced hyperkalemia:

-   Some studies have shown that the administration of 0.6 mg/kg (10% of induction dose) of rocuronium prior to the administration of succinylcholine has resulted in less elevation of serum potassium.
-   In normal individuals, the increase in serum K+ is approximately 0.5–1.0 mEq/L, occurs within 3–5 minutes after the IV administration of succinylcholine, and lasts less than 10–15 minutes.
-   However, in certain conditions, such as trauma, burns, infection, and certain neuromuscular disorders, there is an exaggerated increase in the serum K+ level that may manifest clinically in cardiac dysrhythmias and even cardiac arrest.
-   This is not a common practice and is still controversial, requiring more research.

Accelerating onset of action:

Precurarization can accelerate the onset time for succinylcholine or an NMBD.

By pre-blocking some receptors, the subsequent full dose can bind to the remaining receptors more quickly, leading to a faster and more profound muscle block.

This is not a common practice and is still controversial, requiring more research
