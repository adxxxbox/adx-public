Hydrocele   

### Hydrocele

A hydrocele is a pocket of watery liquid that has built up around the testicles within the scrotum. Sometimes, this is because the testicle is diseased. More often, it is because there is an open pathway between the scrotum and abdominal cavity. A hydrocele may involve either one side or both sides of the scrotum.

**There are two types of hydrocele**  
Communicating  
Non-communicating

Neither type of hydrocele is dangerous.

Non-communicating (simple) hydroceles usually go away on their own.

Communicating hydroceles are usually fixed because they are potential hernias.

Most hernias and hydroceles in children are associated with a patent processus vaginalis (PPV).

**Communicating Hydrocele**  
During gestation, the gonads, nerves and blood vessels descend through the inguinal canal into the scrotum. A process vaginalis will generally close off the inguinal canal, which seals the passage between the scrotum and abdominal cavity. Should this closure be incomplete, the peritoneal fluid from the abdominal cavity may seep through the patent process vaginalis (PPV) and collect in the scrotum forming a hydrocele. If the PPV is large enough, a portion of the small intestine can also migrate into the inguinal canal and/or scrotum, forming a hernia.

Most hydroceles in infants will go away by the time they are 2 years old.

Repairing a communicating hydrocele may involve removing the excess fluid and entering abdominal cavity to close the open passage.

**How to repair a** **Communicating Hydrocele**

An incision is made in the inguinal space and the fluid is drained. The passageway between the scrotum and abdomen is closed.

**Non-communicating hydroceles  
**These hydroceles may also be present at birth or develop as a boy matures. In a non-communicating hydrocele, the process vaginalis has closed appropriately. The fluid surrounding the testicle is created by the lining cells of the process vaginalis and is unable to either drain or be reabsorbed efficiently and thus accumulates. The fluid in the hydrocele is usually reabsorbed before the infant reaches age 1 year.

A communicating hydrocele may be small in the morning and increase in size during the day. Anything that increases intraabdominal pressure will increase the size of the hydrocele. Also, if the scrotum is squeezed, it will deflate.

**Females may develop a Hydrocele**In this case, the sack and connection exist in the labia majora instead of the scrotum.
