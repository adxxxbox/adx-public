Local Anesthetics and Systemic Absorption    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Local Anesthetics and Systemic Absorption

The higher the vascularity, the more absorption.  
  
The rate of systemic absorption is proportionate to the degree of vascularity at the site of injection and the total dose.  
Increase in the area of vascularity = Increase in local anesthetic absorption Meaning an increase in toxicity risk!**  
  
We use the acronym “BICEPS”  
****Blood > Intercostal > Caudal > Epidural > Brachial Plexus > Sciatic**
