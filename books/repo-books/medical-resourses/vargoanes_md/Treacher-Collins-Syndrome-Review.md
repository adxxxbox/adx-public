Treacher Collins Syndrome   

### Treacher Collins Syndrome

(Mandibulofacial Dysostosis)

Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by distinctive abnormalities of the head and face area resulting from underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of certain facial structures including the jaw, cheekbones and nearby structures (zygomatic complex). Craniofacial abnormalities usually involve the cheekbones, jaws, mouth, ears, and/or eyes.

In anesthesia, these kids tend to have difficult airways, which is reviewed in “Treacher Collins and Anesthesia.”

The specific symptoms and physical characteristics associated with TCS can vary greatly from one individual to another. Some individuals may have mild symptoms that go undiagnosed, while others may develop serious, life-threatening respiratory complications

**Genetics:**  
TCS is caused by a mutation in the TCOF1, POLR1C or POLR1D genes. In the case of TCOF1 or POLR1D, the mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant, while in the case of POLR1C it is autosomal recessive.

A hallmark feature of these children are “sad-looking faces” due to the droopy appearance of the lower eyelids, which is caused by the lack of bony support around the lower portion of the orbit.

Their eyelashes may be missing or growing irregularly. These kids may also be prone to dry eyes and eye infection

Growth of craniofacial structures derived from the first and second pharyngeal arch, groove, and pouch is diminished symmetrically and bilaterally.

The syndrome was named after the eminent British ophthalmologist Edward Treacher Collins (1862-1932), who described the essential features of this syndrome in a paper in 1900

Males and females are equally affected.

Treacher Collins syndrome is clearly diagnosed at birth. Because of typical facial abnormalities in severe cases, it may also be diagnosed prenatally by ultrasonography.

**Prevalence:** 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 70,000 of live births

**Skeleton**  
Skull-square forehead  
Flattening of the occipito-parietal region  
Lack of angulations in the nasofrontal region  
Long occipito-frontal diameter  
Asymmetry of the skull caused by maldevelopment of the internal structure of the skull, such as petrosal bone.

**Facial bones**  
Malars under developed with small ridges  
Lack of zygomatic arch  
Small antra or large antra  
Hypertrophic nasal septum  
Hypertrophic maxillary arch  
Frequently highly arched palate  
Possible cleft lip  
Malgrowing teeth  
Hypoplastic mandible, retruded with angle of jaw obtuse, which can lead to an open bite.  
  
**Others**  
Some cases-fused cervical vertebrae  
Abnormal costosternal structure, such as pectus excavates, long metacarpal and metatarsal bones.

**Eye**  
Narrow interpalpebral spaces  
Notching on the outer portion of the lower eyelid mostly, and occasionally on the upper eyelid.  
The eyelashes are absent or growing irregularly in two or three rows.  
Absence of lachrymal glands  
Lateral deviation or protrusion of the eyeball  
Congenital ptosis.

**Ears  
**Ear deformities range from prominent ears to misshapen ears to complete absence of the external ear.  
40% of children will have hearing loss in both ears.  
Absence or occlusion of auditory meatus  

**Mouth**  
Mostly there is macrostomia and in some cases, microstomia (occasionally undeveloped tongue).

Atresia of **pharyngeal ring**.

**Cheeks**  
There may be a blind fistulae on the cheeks, and rarely “tongue–shaped” growth of hair, on the lateral sides of the face.

**Nose**  
In the majority of cases it is big, with a very short columella  
Narrow nares  
Small lateral cartilages

**Associated deformities** -Hypermobility of the phalanges.

**Mental development**  
Typically grows to become normal functioning adults of normal intelligence.
