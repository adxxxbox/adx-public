Gastrectomy - Total     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Gastrectomy - Total

Is the removal all of the stomach and nearby lymph nodes. Sometimes the spleen and parts of the esophagus, intestines, pancreas, and other nearby organs are removed. The end of the esophagus is then attached to proximal part of the small intestine. People who have had a Total Gastrectomy can only eat a small amount of food at a time. 

Open, laparoscopic or assisted laparoscopic are surgical options. Today, the laparoscopic route appears most popular.

**Indications:** Cancer throughout the stomach.

**For Open Procedure:**  
A midline incision is made and the stomach is freed from its attachments. The remaining upper portion of the stomach is sutured and connected to either the duodenum or jejunum.  
**Anesthetic:** General/ETT and usually an Epidural.  
**RSI:** Usually.  
Avoid Nitrous!  
**A-line:** Yes.  
**Duration:** 2-4 hours  
**EBL:** Varies, usually < 200.  
**IV Access:** 2 Large Bore IVs.  
**Position:** Supine, arms usually tucked.  
**NG Tube:** Yes, intra-operatively. The surgeon should verify placement while he/she has direct access and then you should secure it.

**Possible Complications**  
Dehiscence of esophago-jejunal anastomosis: This can be fatal if not recognized post-op.  
Generalized peritonitis.  
Thrombophlebitis.  
Pneumothorax.  
Hepatic Necrosis.  
Post Gastrectomy Syndrome.  
Dumping Syndrome post operatively.  
Hemorrhage.  
Anesthesia Risk.  
Anemia as a result of vitamin B-12 or iron malabsorption and osteoporosis.
