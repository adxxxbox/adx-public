### Patchy Block

**What is a patchy block?** An area or side that the patient feels pain after a block – while the remaining segments are effectively covered by the administered local anesthetic. The pain in this unaffected area can be agonizing as though no anesthesia existed in the neighboring segments.  
  
Patchy blocks are usually one-sided in an otherwise satisfactory field of anesthesia.These occur more often in obstetrical patients than in the general surgical population.  
  
**Possible causes:  
**Migration of the catheter into one of the intervertebral foramina is usually the cause of persistent one-sided block. Remember, the intervertebral foramen is where the nerve root exit the vertebrae.  
Pulling back the catheter 1-2 cm and reinjection of additional dose with the patient positioned on the side of the unblocked segment may help.  
  
Adding a narcotic, (Fentanyl or Morphine) to the local anesthetic has markedly reduced the incidence of patchy analgesia.  
  
Assess where the patient is feeling discomfort. Does she have a “window” of pain? Is she experiencing perineal pain immediately prior to delivery? Rule out a subdural block. (Which occurs when the epidural catheter is in the subdural space rather than epidural space). If you are certain that the patient is experiencing a subdural block, consider immediately replacing the catheter.  
  
**Is the partituent experiencing Perineal pain?  
If yes,** consider fentanyl 100 mcg per epidural or a few ml of a concentrated local anesthetic.  
  
**When the epidural** **is working, but the partituent is only feeling a window of pain**  
You should consider a bolus of a more concentrated local anesthetic with the patient lying with the unblocked segment down. Have a low threshold for replacing these catheters, as it is often difficult to remedy a “window.”
