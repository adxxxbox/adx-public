Prasugrel (Effient, Efient)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Prasugrel (Effient, Efient)

**Anti-Platelet Agent** (Thienopyridine derivative, so is Clopidogrel)  
ADP antagonist and considered a P2Y12 antagonist.  
  
Selective irreversible platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibition → decreased ADP binding  
to P2Y12 → increased cAMP levels. Prevents glycoprotein IIb/IIIb receptors on the surface of the activated platelets.  
  
**Review:** ADP interacts with a family of ADP receptors found on platelets (P2Y1, P2Y12, and P2X1), which leads to platelet activation. P2Y1 receptors initiate platelet aggregation and shape change as a result of interactions with ADP.  
  
**Prasugrel compared to Clopidogrel**  
Prasugrel inhibits adenosine diphosphate–induced platelet aggregation more rapidly, more consistently, and to a greater extent than do standard and higher doses of clopidogrel in healthy volunteers and in patients with coronary artery disease, including those undergoing PCI.  
  
**Indications:  
**To reduce the rate of thrombotic cardiovascular (CV) events (including stent thrombosis) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who are to be managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as follows:  
Patients with unstable angina (UA) or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).  
Patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) when managed with primary or delayed PCI.  
Commonly used with aspirin.  
  
**Mechanism of Action**  
Prasugrel is an inhibitor of platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets.  
Antagonizing the P2Y12 receptors will result in a decreased expression of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIb receptors on the surface of the activated platelets. This inhibits platelet adhesion and aggregation.  
  
**Prasugel and its active metabolite**  
Prasugrel is a prodrug that, like clopidogrel, requires conversion to an active metabolite before binding to the platelet P2Y 12 receptor to confer antiplatelet activity.  
Prasugrel inhibits adenosine diphosphate–induced platelet aggregation more rapidly, more consistently, and to a greater extent than do standard and higher doses of clopidogrel in healthy volunteers.  
  
**Monitor:** ADP antagonist are considered reliable and not routinely monitored, unlike heparin and warfarin. There is no therapeutic drug monitoring widely available for P2Y12 antagonists, in contrast with warfarin and heparin.  
**Any test that measures platelet functionality can be used.**  
Whole blood aggregation  
(Verify-Now P2Y12 Test)  
PRP Aggregation P2Y12 Assay  
TEGs-unreliable  
  
**Monitor:** P2Y12 platelet receptor cascade tests (VerifyNow P2Y12 \[PRU test\])  
**Effect on PT/PTT:** None  
  
**Antidote:** None, 1 unit Platelet transfusion > 6 hours after loading dose of Effient or > 4 hours after maintenance dose.  
**Antidote:** None  
Platelet inhibition by prasugrel is rapid and **irreversible,** lasting for the life of the platelet.  
Platelet transfusion may restore clotting ability. The prasugrel active metabolite is not likely to be removed by dialysis.  
  
Prasugrel causes 90% inhibition of platelet function compared to 60-70% for clopidogrel.  
The superior antiplatelet effect of prasugrel is secondary to its improved metabolism, resulting in more active metabolites being delivered to the platelet.  
Effient is faster & more predictable than clopidogrel.  
CYP2C19 polymorphism is less important for metabolic activation.Prasugrel has a rapid onset of effect.  
  
**Peak plasma concentration:** occurs in 30 minutes  
Prasugrel has a faster onset than clopidogrel because it requires only one metabolic step to form its active metabolite, is not involved in drug-drug interactions and is not susceptible to genetic polymorphisms.  
**Median half-life:** 3.7 hours (literature varies)  
The active metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 7 hours.  
  
**Time to normal hemostasis after discontinue:** 5-14 days (literature varies)  
Platelet activity does not normalize until seven days after it is stopped.**_Metabolism and Elimination_** Prasugrel is a prodrug and is rapidly metabolized to a pharmacologically active metabolite and inactive metabolites.  
Prasugrel is rapidly hydrolyzed in the intestine to a thiolactone, which is then converted to the active metabolite by a single step, primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.  
Intestinal esterase plays important role; therefore, Effient requires fewer hepatic metabolic steps for activation.  
Metabolism independent of CYP genotype.  
  
**Excretion:** urine (68%), feces (27%)

| Minimal Time between  
last dose and block | Can it be given with  
epidural catheter in place? | When to restart Effient  
after catheter removal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7-10 days | Avoid | 6 hours |

  
**Restart medication after procedure:** 6 hours  
**Remove catheter after administration:** 7-10 days  
  
Allow platelet function to recover before neuraxial block after administration of Prasugrel (Effient).  
The time to normal platelet aggregation after discontinuation of therapy with Effient is 7-10 days.  
This time course reflects new platelet production rather than pharmacokinetics of prasugrel.
