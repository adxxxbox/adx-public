| BP management | Considerations |
| --- | --- |
| **BP:** 140-160 systolic  
**Arterial line** to monitor BP  
**Vasopressors:** Small boluses as needed.  
**Heart rate:** Maintain ≥ 70 bpm.  
Anticholinergics are advised.  
If glycopyrrolate is used, administer at beginning of procedure.  
**Hypotension** must be avoided to maintain effective reversal flow.  
**Reverse flow** varies with the difference between arterial and venous BP. | Keep patient's head immobile  
Keep tubes and wires clear of the patient's head (may obscure angiogram)  
Local or MAC procedure; convert to general if not tolerated.  
Check Activated Coagulation Time (ACT) Q 30 minutes; maintain above 250 seconds.  
**Heparin:** Initial dose to be given after cutdown but before arterial puncture. |

**Monitoring:  
Neuromonitoring:** Cerebral oximetry and/or somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) according to surgeon preference.  
Arterial line  
**For MAC:** Fentanyl and dexmedetomidine (Precedex®) is frequently used.  
Patients may be cooperative enough to require only midazolam (Versed®) sedation.  
Dexmedetomidine (Precedex®) infusion can be started when patients becomes too talkative.  
Consider starting dexmedetomidine (Precedex®) at or around about 0.7 mcg/kg/hr; titrate to effect.  
  
**Nicardipine (Cardene®)** infusion must be primed and inline.  
Cerebral Oximetry (obtain baseline left and right hemispheres)  
Nasal cannula with ETCO 2 monitoring capability.  
  
**Intra-op  
**Administer anticholinergic  
Follow TCAR recommendations.  
Neuro exam: During clamping. Continue talking with the patient.  
Alert surgeon when patient slurring occurs.  
**Heart rate:** It may be difficult to increase HR > 70 bpm when the patient is beta-blocked.  
Profound bradycardia may occur if and when the surgeon balloon dilates the carotid artery.  
Bradycardia can be prevented with the prophylactic administration of an anticholinergic.  
Expect a decrease in cerebral oximetry (SaO 2 ) during clamping in the presence of poor collateral circulation.  
  
**Post-op  
BP goal** is a systolic BP 110-140 mmHg.  
Consider **Nicardipine (Cardene®)** infusion as needed.  
  
**Key points:**  
Consider avoiding benzodiazepines and propofol.  
Fentanyl, 50-200 mcg is has been suggested.
