### CSE Has Less Failed Blocks

  
CSE:(Combined Spinal Epidural)  

**Why the incidence of a failed epidural, unilateral block and dural puncture is reduced with CSE**  
**_By Lisa Stiel Moreno, CRNA_**  
  
The answer is quite simple.  
In order to get a good flow of CSF, the epidural needle must be in the epidural space and not a false space, and it must be fairly close to a perfect midline insertion point, reducing the risk of a failed or unilateral block.  
  
Finally, it reduces the incidence of wet tap because it allows the clinician to test if they are at a false loss of resistance by placing the spinal needle and looking for CSF after the loss of resistance, rather than advancing forward blindly. Thus, the spinal needle becomes like a “sounding device.”
