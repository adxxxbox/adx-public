Vagotomy     body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Vagotomy

These cases have become very rare.  
The surgical cutting of the vagus nerve to eliminate the parasympathetic supply to the stomach (lessen acid secretion within the stomach).

**Indications**: For patients with ulcers that has become untreatable and Gastric Outlet Obstruction.

It’s usually performed along with another GI surgery- antrectomy or subtotal gastrectomy.

Some vagotomies are emergency cases from bleeding and perforated ulcers.

These procedures are mostly done laparoscopically. Some are open or even  

thoracoscopic.  
**There are 3 types:**  
**Vagotomy and Antrectomy (V&A):** More extensive and takes longer.  
**Vagotomy and Pyloroplasty (V&P):** Most common  
**Parietal Cell Vagotomy (PCV):** A Pyloroplasty is not needed but it’s still extensive.  
**Anesthesia:** General/ETT with RSI  
Esophageal Dilators are eventually inserted orally to control the traction on the stomach. You need to hold on to the endotube and prevent extubation when the surgeon initially passes and later removes it.  
Avoid Nitrous.  
**Duration:** 1-3 hours  
**Position:** Supine  
**EBL:** 1-200mLs, V&A can have more  
**IV Access:** 1 Large bore.   
**NG Tube:** Yes, ask the surgeon when.

  
**Possible Complications:**  
Gastric or esophageal perforation. May take place from an electrocautery injury or by clipping the branch from the nerve of Latarjet.  
Dumping syndrome and diarrhea.

**More Notes:**  
With better drug therapy and the discovery of Helicobacter Pylori, Vagotomies have become rare.

Parietal Cell Vagotomy (PCV) is also known as Highly Selective Vagotomy (HSV).

**Thoracoscopic vagotomy**: Carried out with the third, sixth, and seventh left intercostal spaces, the posterior vagus trunk is isolated, clipped, along with a segment excised.

The vagus nerve trunk divides into branches, which go to various areas of the stomach. Stimulation from all of these branches results in the stomach to create acid. Too much gastric acid results in ulcers.

A vagotomy will also cause a reduction in peristalsis, along with an alternation in the emptying patterns from the stomach. To help ease this, a pyloroplasty is usually carried out to widen the outlet in the stomach towards the small intestine.

Individuals, who consume too much alcohol, smoke, are obese, and therefore are very young or aged are in greater risk for problems.
