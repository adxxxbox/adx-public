### Octreotide

**Brand names:** Bynfezia, Mycapssa, Sandostatin**Classes:** Somatostatin and analogs  
  
**Somatostatin and analogs indications:  
  
Carcinoid tumors (Carcinoid syndrome)  
**For control of acute variceal hemorrhage- off-label  
Portal hypertension-off label  
  
Octreotide is the only vasoconstrictor available in the United States to control acute variceal hemorrhage.  
  
**For liver patients:  
**Somatostatin and analogs (octreotide, vapreotide) cause splanchnic vasoconstriction, resulting in significant transient reductions in portal pressure.  
  
**Both octreotide and vapreotide doses for portal hypertension and/or variceal hemorrhage:  
**initial bolus of 50 mcg intravenously followed by a continuous infusion of 50 mcg/hour.  
Therapy can be maintained for 2 to 5 days.  
  
Anatomically, the portal vein is formed by the union of the superior mesenteric and splenic vein.  
The mesenteric vein collects blood from the splanchnic circulation.  
Thus, portal venous inflow is determined by the state of constriction or dilatation of splanchnic arterioles.  
  
  
**A carcinoid crisis is characterized by the following:  
**Circulatory collapse resulting in vascular instability (severe hypotension)  
Profound flushing  
Altered mental status  
Wheezing  
  
**Perioperative doses:  
**There is no standard perioperative regimen of octreotide for carcinoid syndrome.**  
  
Recommended guidelines for the management and treatment of neuroendocrine tumors 2010 and 2013:  
**250–500 mcg IV bolus of octreotide for carcinoid syndrome-related hypotension and bronchospasms for minor procedures, followed by an infusion of 100–500 mcg/hour for major procedures.**  
  
Commonly accepted pre and perioperative regimens of octreotide:  
**Start octreotide 50-200 mcg Sub Q TID for two weeks prior to surgery and 100 mcg IV just prior to induction of anesthesia to prevent the release of carcinoid secretions.  
  
IV boluses of 50-500 mcg before induction followed by a continuous infusion of 20-50 mcg/hour to prevent further crisis.  
  
Doses of 100 mcg BID a day before surgery and 100 mcg bolus prior to induction suppress the sudden release of mediators.  
Continuous infusion rate of 50 mcg/hour for at least 12 hours prior to surgery.  
  
**Non-surgical related dosing of octreotide:  
FDA-approved for diarrhea associated with vasoactive intestinal peptide-secreting tumors:  
Dose:** 200-300 mcg/day Sub Q or IV in 2-4 divided doses for two weeks.  
**For diarrhea associated with carcinoid tumors:** 100-600 mcg/day sub Q or IV in 2-4 divided doses for two weeks.  
  
**Octreotide** has an antiproliferative effect on advanced neuroendocrine tumors and reduces adverse effects related to carcinoid tumors/crisis and/or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIPoma) tumors.  
It is also indicated for treating acromegaly by reducing the release of growth hormone (GH).  
In acromegalic patients, octreotide reduces serum levels of GH, decreasing associated symptoms such as headache, hyperhidrosis, arthralgia, and finger circumference.  
  
Perioperatively, anesthesia providers often insist on having Octreotide readily available to manage potential or existing carcinoid crises.  
  
**Mechanism of action (similar to somatostatin):  
**Octreotide binds to somatostatin receptors coupled to phospholipase C through G proteins, leading to smooth muscle contraction in the blood vessels.  
Downstream effects that stimulate phospholipase C, the production of 1, 4,5-inositol triphosphate, and action on the L-type calcium channels lead to the inhibition of growth hormone, treating the various growth-hormone and metabolic effects of acromegaly.  
  
**Octreotide inhibits the secretion of both pituitary and gastrointestinal hormones, including:  
**Serotonin  
Gastrin  
Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)  
Insulin  
Glucagon  
Secretin  
Motilin  
Pancreatic polypeptide  
Growth hormone  
Thyrotropin  
  
**Due to the number of hormones affected by octreotide, the actions of octreotide are diverse.**  
  
**Inhibiting the secretion of serotonin and other gastroenteropancreatic peptides results in:**  
Increased intestinal absorption of water and electrolytes  
Decreased pancreatic and gastric acid secretions  
Increases intestinal transit time.  
  
**Vasoconstrictor:**  
Octreotide can inhibit the secretion of hormones involved in vasodilation.  
This property makes octreotide useful in treating variceal bleeding and orthostatic hypotension.  
  
**Other effects of Octreotide:**  
Splanchnic arteriolar resistance  
Decreases gastrointestinal blood flow  
Decreases splanchnic blood flow  
Decreases hepatic-vein wedge pressure  
Decreases hepatic blood flow  
Decreases portal vein pressure  
Decreases variceal pressure  
  
Decreased blood flow to the portal vein reduces portal venous pressure in patients with cirrhosis or portal hypertension.  
A majority of patients with portal hypertension have a reduction in variceal bleeding when given octreotide.  
  
**Decreases diarrhea:  
**Because octreotide affects many GI hormones, octreotide is useful in controlling many types of secretory diarrhea, including patients with VIPomas and AIDS-associated diarrhea.  
In patients with VIPomas, octreotide reduces serum levels of VIP.  
As a result, stool volume decreases, and hypokalemia and achlorhydria improve.  
  
**Contraindications to Octreotide:  
**\- Hypersensitivity  
\- Use very cautiously in patients with insulinoma and type 2 diabetes mellitus who require intensive blood glucose monitoring and control because it can dramatically lower glucose levels and reduce their insulin requirements by up to 50%.  
\- Serum glucose concentrations should be monitored carefully during octreotide therapy. - Octreotide also increases the bioavailability of bromocriptine by up to 40%, which is a matter of concern because octreotide and bromocriptine are both used to treat acromegaly.  
\- Octreotide may also lead to bradycardia, arrhythmias, or conduction defects and, therefore, should be used with caution in at-risk patients.  
  
**Route:** Sub Q, IM or IV  
  
**Sub-Q and IV distribution:  
**IV and Sub-Q octreotide are bioequivalent; peak concentrations are dose-proportional and rapid.  
  
**Distribution half-life:** Around 12 minutes.  
Adult peak concentrations: 5.2 ng/mL occur within 25 minutes after a 100 mcg dose.  
The effects of subcutaneous octreotide are variable but can last up to 12 hours, depending on the indication for use.  
  
**IM injections:  
**After a single IM injection in healthy adult patients, peak serum concentrations reach a transient initial peak of 0.03 ng/mL/mg within 1 hour.  
  
**Volume of distribution:** 13.6  
**Metabolism:** Mostly the liver  
**  
Route of elimination:**  
32% in the urine  
30-40% by the liver into the feces  
11% of the unchanged parent drug is found in the urine  
2% of the unchanged parent drug can be recovered in the feces  
  
**Total body clearance:** 7-10 L/hour in adult patients  
**The elimination half-life** of immediate-release octreotide injection: 1.7 to 1.9 hours**Sub Q:** 0.2 hours  
**Oral administration:** 2.3 - 2.7 hours  
  
**Onset with IV bolus:** Stabilizes the BP within ten minutes when symptoms are due to carcinoid vasoactive mediators.  
**Half-life:** 90 minutes-3 hours.  
  
**Octreotide affects cytochrome P450:  
**It affects cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isoenzymes and drug transporters: CYP3A4  
Octreotide suppresses GH secretion, which may decrease the metabolic clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4.  
A potential for drug-drug interactions exists with medications metabolized by CYP3A4 with a narrow therapeutic index.  
  
**Adverse effects:**  
Bradycardia  
Arrhythmias, or conduction defects  
Hyperglycemia  
Chest or abdominal pain  
Fatigue  
Malaise  
Dizziness  
Cholelithiasis requiring cholecystectomy  
  
_About 50% of patients receiving somatostatin analogs are reported to have biliary sludge or gallstones.  
  
_**Product labeling warns that octreotide may cause the following:**  
Reduce gallbladder contractility  
Reduce bile secretion  
Reduce the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in healthy volunteers.  
It may reduce vitamin B-12 levels  
Octreotide is commonly diluted into a 10 mL syringe of normal saline.  
  
**Non-surgical related dosing of octreotide:**  
**FDA-approved for diarrhea associated with vasoactive intestinal peptide-secreting tumors:  
Dose:** 200-300 mcg/day Sub Q or IV in 2-4 divided doses for two weeks.  
**For diarrhea associated with carcinoid tumors:** 100-600 mcg/day sub Q or IV in 2-4 divided doses for two weeks.  
**Extra notes:  
3 SAs:** Octreotide, lanreotide and pasireotide**Octreotide** is the most common SA administered perioperatively to prevent and treat symptoms associated with carcinoid syndrome or crises.
