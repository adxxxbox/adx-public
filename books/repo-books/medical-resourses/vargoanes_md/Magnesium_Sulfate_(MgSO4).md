Magnesium Sulfate (MgSO4)    body {font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;}

### Magnesium (MgSO4) Analgesia

An analgesic adjuvant for perioperative pain.  
  
**Infusion rates**  
**Loading dose:**  30-50 mg/kg over 15 minutes.  
Followed by a maintenance dose of 6-20 mg/kg/h until the end of surgery.   
**Note:**  A single bolus of MgSO 4  without the following maintenance infusion is has been reported to be effective for postoperative analgesia.  
  
_Magnesium sulfate has a high therapeutic index and is cost-effective._  
  
**When MgSO 4  is used intraoperatively**  
MgSO 4  demonstrates anesthetic and analgesic-sparing effects, which enable anesthesia providers to reduce the dose of intraoperative anesthetics and postoperative analgesics for up to 24 hours.  
  
**Anesthesia related advantages of MgSO 4  infusion.**  
Is associated with decreased incidence of nausea and vomiting.  
_May be due to requiring less volatile anesthetic and opioids, rather than any direct antiemetic effect._  
Decreases the incidence of emergence shivering by up to 70-90%.  
May prevent hyperkalemia produced by succinylcholine.  
Pretreatment is associated with less fasciculation induced by succinylcholine.  
Increases duration of action of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.  
  
**Other uses of magnesium sulfate:  
**Myocardial protection; may be administered with open heart surgery.  
Treatment of arrhythmia (Torsade de Pointes).  
Control of severe asthma.CNS symptom control in pre eclamptic patients.  
  
**Magnesium sulfate treatment dose for preeclampsia and eclampsia**  
4- 6 gram loading dose diluted in 100 mL fluid administered intravenous over 15 minutes, follow by continuous intravenous infusion at 1 to 2 grams per hour.   
Discontinue 24 hours after delivery or last seizure.  
  
**Mechanisms of action  
**Magnesium exhibits competitive antagonism on hippocampal presynaptic calcium channels that regulate neurotransmitter release, including the Ca++ mediated release of acetylcholine in the central nervous system antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and its associated ion channels.  
**Note:**  Calcium channel blockers have shown antinociceptive effects in animals and morphine potentiation in patients with chronic pain.  
**  
Cardiovascular effects**  
From a cardiovascular perspective, MgSO 4  appears to be a safe drug.   
Studies demonstrate magnesium is an arteriolar vasodilator with minimal dilatory effects on venous circulation, contributing to increased cardiac filling and cardiac output.   
  
Case studies indicate that MgSO4 appears to be effective therapy for torsade de pointes. Magnesium deficiency appears to contribute to the incidence and severity of other arrhythmias, particularly after cardiac surgery.  
  
Magnesium homeostasis is mainly regulated by intestinal absorption and renal excretion.   
Hypermagnesemia is rare and occurs mainly in patients with renal failure during therapeutic administration of magnesium-containing drugs or other treatment-related causes, (eg. patients treated for eclampsia receiving MgSO4).  
  
**Magnesium plasma levels**   
**0.7–1.3 mmol/L:**  Normal (1.7 – 2.7 mg/dL)  
**4-5 mmol/L:**  Loss of deep tendon reflex, dizziness and widened QRS complexes.  
**\> 6 mmol/L:**  Hypotension, narcosis, respiratory depression and/or arrest.  
**\> 6-7.5 mmol/L:**  cardiac arrest  
  
**Panic values:**  
< 0.5 or > 4.5 mg/d or < 0.2 or 1.85 mmol/L  
  
**Sometimes the values are given in mEq/L.  
In this case normal ranges are:**  
Adults: 1.3-2.1 mEq/L  
Children: 1.4-1.8 mEq/L  
  
**Pregnancy:  
1.6-2.1 mg/dL (0.66-0/86mmol/L)  
Preeclampsia therapeutic range: 4-7 mEq/L (1.65-2.88 mmol/L)**  
  
In the International System of Units (SI), magnesium in the blood is measured in mmol/L.  
The valence of magnesium is +2 (1 mEq= 1 mmol / valence).  
  
**Treatment of severe**  **hypermagnesemia**    
Intravenous administration of calcium gluconate.   
Ventilatory and/or circulatory support.  
Loop diuretics to increase renal excretion of magnesium when renal function is adequate.  
Hemodialysis when the patient has compromised renal function.
