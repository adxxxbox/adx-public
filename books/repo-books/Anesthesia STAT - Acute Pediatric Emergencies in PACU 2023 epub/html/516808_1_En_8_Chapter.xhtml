In pediatric patients, it is more likely to be diagnosed in boys 10 years and older. Both genetic and environmental factors are linked to the development of <span id="ITerm4">NAFLD</span>. However, diet, exercise, and excess weight gain are significant modifiable risk factors for prevention and management.</p><p class="Para" id="Par5">In this teenager, the most likely etiology of transaminitis is <span id="ITerm5">NAFLD</span> which is now the most common cause of chronic liver disease in obese children and adolescents. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a form of <span id="ITerm6">NAFLD</span> where the fat deposition is accompanied by inflammation of liver cells and liver damage. NASH, if not diagnosed and treated, can lead to cirrhosis and ultimately live failure or cancer as an adult.</p><p class="Para" id="Par6">Obese children have a 38% chance of developing fatty liver disease. Other conditions of metabolic syndrome—hypertension, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and high cholesterol and triglycerides—significantly increase the likelihood of <span id="ITerm7">NAFLD</span> and NASH. Lifestyle modification to achieve weight loss is the initial treatment for <span id="ITerm8">NAFLD</span> by reducing excess fat deposits and inflammation. However, if this fails and there is evidence of steatohepatitis, these patients may need surgical intervention to manage and prevent progression of disease.</p><p class="Para" id="Par7">The European and North American Societies for Pediatric Hepatology published a consensus statement paper in 2012 on the diagnosis of <span id="ITerm9">NAFLD</span>. While there is no consensus on the indications for liver biopsy in the workup, it was agreed that liver biopsy should not be used as a screening procedure given its high cost and invasive nature. However, expert opinion supports liver biopsy to exclude other treatable liver pathology as well as staging the degree of fibrosis indicating a progression to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>].</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec3"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">3 </span>What Preprocedural Workup Should Be Done Prior to Liver Biopsy for <span id="ITerm10">NAFLD</span>?</h2><p class="Para" id="Par8">Patients who are being worked up for <span id="ITerm11">NAFLD</span> should have noninvasive studies performed prior to consideration for biopsy. Aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin can be used as indices of hepatobiliary injury. Furthermore, noninvasive imaging such as liver ultrasounds can provide vital information for proceduralists such as significant vasculature to avoid. Recent research has been focused on identifying imaging biomarkers on modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging that help improve noninvasive forms of diagnosis and staging [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>]. And yet to date, liver biopsy and histology remain the gold standard for diagnosis. Liver biopsies can be performed percutaneously, both “blind” and image-guided, via trans-jugular or from a laparoscopic or laparotomy approach. The percutaneous approach is the most common as it is the simplest and least invasive. In most suspected cases of <span id="ITerm12">NAFLD</span>, the biopsy core sample obtained with a percutaneous needle will be sufficient information for diagnosis. However, in cases of more severe liver disease presenting with coagulopathy or ascites, percutaneous sampling may not be appropriate due to their increased risk for postprocedural hemorrhage. Therefore prior to percutaneous biopsy, patients should have preoperative lab work drawn including complete blood count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen. And periprocedural optimization should be considered with vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></span>].</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec4"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">4 </span>What Are Postanesthetic Concerns in Obese Children?</h2><p class="Para" id="Par9">Obesity is a well-known <span id="ITerm13">epidemic</span> in the pediatric population today. We are seeing more obese patients presenting for routine pediatric surgeries as well as an increasing number of procedures in pediatric patients related to their obesity. The most well-described concern is these patients’ increased risk for <span id="ITerm14">perioperative respiratory adverse events (PRAE)</span>. Tait et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></span>] prospectively studied the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and perioperative respiratory adverse events in children. They collected data from 2025 children undergoing elective, noncardiac surgery in a 20-month period. The obese children had a greater incidence of difficult mask ventilation, airway obstruction, bronchospasm, and significant oxygen desaturation. In developing a risk prediction tool for perioperative respiratory adverse events in pediatric ambulatory anesthesia, Subramanyam et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></span>] identified morbid obesity as one of the five significantly predictive variables. These patients’ increased risk of respiratory events is also consistent with their higher rates of asthma and obstructive sleep apnea [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR6" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par10">Excess <span id="ITerm15">weight</span> can also alter pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and the appropriate dosing of anesthetic medications is not fully understood. A general suggestion is to dose lipophilic medications by total body weight (TBW) and hydrophilic medications by ideal body weight (IBW). Yet this is an extreme oversimplification that needs to be paired with clinical judgment especially in obese patients with comorbidities such as obstructive sleep apnea [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></span>]. Such patients with decreased respiratory compliance might be highly sensitive to a blunting of their respiratory drive, and some may require positive pressure support postoperatively. Nafiu et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">9</a></span>] and Kako et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></span>] both found increased PACU length of stays in overweight and obese children.</p><p class="Para" id="Par11">Other perioperative challenges with obesity include difficult vascular access, more challenging positioning, and prolonged procedural times [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></span>]. Suboptimal positioning and inadequate padding can result in more discomfort in the recovery period.</p><p class="Para" id="Par12"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">After an hour in PACU, the patient started complaining of right shoulder pain and was tachycardic to the 130 s.

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec5"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">5 </span>What Are Known Complications of Liver Biopsy in Pediatric Patients?</h2><p class="Para" id="Par13">Pain is the most common <span id="ITerm16">complication</span> after a percutaneous liver biopsy. In a 2003 study by Eisenberg et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR12" role="doc-biblioref">12</a></span>], 84% of adults reported pain within the first hour post-biopsy despite oral anxiolysis and local anesthetic infiltration. Pain is typically at the incision site or referred pain to the right shoulder. Pain is categorized in the pediatric literature as a common minor complication, manageable with limited analgesia and does not prolong hospitalization. Even in a 2017 study by Hayatghaibi et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR13" role="doc-biblioref">13</a></span>] where 4 out of 198 pediatric patients returned after discharge to an emergency department for pain, none were found to have postprocedural bleeding, and all were treated with analgesics and discharged home for clinic follow-up.</p><p class="Para" id="Par14">This patient’s anticipated postoperative <span id="ITerm17">pain</span> was prophylactically treated with local anesthetic injection at the biopsy site as well as small doses of intravenous narcotics and acetaminophen intraoperatively. However due to this patient’s obstructive sleep apnea, opioids were used sparingly in the postoperative period. Additional doses of intravenous acetaminophen were also limited in the setting of his liver disease. Prophylactic antiemetics should be given to help prevent pain from retching and vomiting which could worsen pain in the postoperative period.</p><p class="Para" id="Par15"><span id="ITerm18">Bleeding</span> is a known complication of liver biopsy that can significantly increase morbidity. The incidence of post-procedure bleeding in pediatrics was initially reported at a higher rate than in adults. Based primarily on smaller single-institution studies, the incidence is reported between 1 and 12% [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR14" role="doc-biblioref">14</a></span>–<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR16" role="doc-biblioref">16</a></span>]. However, clinically significant bleeding appears to be much rarer. Short et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">17</a></span>] reported the highest postprocedural transfusion rate of 3.3%. Since that publication, several other single-institution studies reported &lt;1% incidence of major bleeding requiring transfusion [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR18" role="doc-biblioref">18</a></span>–<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">21</a></span>]. To further decrease the risk of post-biopsy hemorrhage, some proceduralists inject hemostatic compounds like thrombin or collagen to the needle tract on withdrawal, and some have standardized all biopsies to be performed with image guidance. Shapira-Zaltsberg et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">21</a></span>] specifically studied the routine use of post-biopsy ultrasound but concluded that its utility was best only in cases of clinical or laboratory signs of complications.</p><p class="Para" id="Par16">Other rare complications reported include pneumothorax or hemothorax, organ perforation, and biliary leak. Being such rare complications, the incidence in pediatric populations is poorly described. Furthermore, the increasing use of ultrasonographic guidance is likely to significantly reduce the rates of these complications.</p><p class="Para" id="Par17"><span id="ITerm19">Infection</span> both local and systemic is also a rare but possible complication. There is no consensus on the use of broad-spectrum prophylactic antibiotics. However, liver transplant patients with bilio-enteric anastomosis have been identified by some authors as a uniquely high-risk population for bacteremia and sepsis [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR22" role="doc-biblioref">22</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR23" role="doc-biblioref">23</a></span>].</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec6"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">6 </span>What Is Kehr’s Sign?</h2><p class="Para" id="Par18">Pain at the tip of the shoulder or “<span id="ITerm20">Kehr’s sign</span>”<span id="ITerm21"/> is a classic example of referred pain from an irritated diaphragm. It was originally used as a harbinger of ruptured spleen more commonly with left shoulder pain [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR24" role="doc-biblioref">24</a></span>]. However, the referred symptoms can be indicative of any peritoneal pathology including hepatic pathology such as in this patient [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR25" role="doc-biblioref">25</a></span>]. Irritation of the diaphragm by inflammation, organ injury, or free blood is signaled by the phrenic nerve and reflected as pain in the area above the clavicle due to the shared C3–C4 origins. Spontaneous bleeding from the liver is usually seen in preeclampsia and seen rarely in healthy patients. A <span id="ITerm22">subcapsular hematoma</span> of the liver is an accumulation of blood between Glisson’s capsule and the liver parenchyma, and if rupture of this hematoma into the peritoneum occurs, then there is a 75% mortality rate. Spontaneous liver hemorrhage, although rare in the non-obstetrical population, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of sudden-onset abdominal pain radiating to the shoulder associated with hepatomegaly with or without signs of shock.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec7"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">7 </span>What Are Risk Factors for Complications After Percutaneous Liver Biopsy?</h2><p class="Para" id="Par19">Appropriate patient selection is essential for optimizing the safety profile of percutaneous liver biopsies, and investigators are continuing to elicit the risk factors for complications. Uncorrected coagulopathy or <span id="ITerm23">thrombocytopenia</span> that can be seen in advance liver disease is considered a contraindication to the percutaneous liver biopsy due to the increased bleeding risk. These are high-risk patients in whom trans-jugular liver biopsy or direct biopsy with laparoscopy or laparotomy is often considered. However, many have reported severe hemorrhage even in the setting of normal coagulation studies.</p><p class="Para" id="Par20">The use of low-molecular-weight heparin was also found to increase bleeding complications. Fortunately, though, low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), a common medication for post-liver transplant patients, did not have an increase bleeding incidence or complication rate [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR15" role="doc-biblioref">15</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par21">Several authors have also tried to identify liver pathologies associated with increased risk for <span id="ITerm24">complications</span>. Westheim et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR15" role="doc-biblioref">15</a></span>] noted increased risk of bleeding in patients with focal lesions as well as over increased risk of major complications in patients with acute liver failure. Older studies identified malignancy, ascites, and biliary tract dilation as additional risk factors for complications [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR26" role="doc-biblioref">26</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR27" role="doc-biblioref">27</a></span>]. Liver transplant patients did not have an increased risk for bleeding complications compared to the general population, even when suspected of rejection [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR15" role="doc-biblioref">15</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">17</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR19" role="doc-biblioref">19</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par22">While blind percutaneous liver biopsy is still a viable and safe option in pediatric patients even when performed by trainees [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR20" role="doc-biblioref">20</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR28" role="doc-biblioref">28</a></span>], since real-time ultrasound imaging is available, there is an inherent advantage of identifying and therefore avoiding injury to other structures [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR29" role="doc-biblioref">29</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR30" role="doc-biblioref">30</a></span>]. There is limited pediatric-specific data to suggest a lower complication rate with ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsies [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR31" role="doc-biblioref">31</a></span>]. A greater number of needle passes have also been identified as a predictor for higher incidence of minor bleeding [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR19" role="doc-biblioref">19</a></span>]. Patients who are younger in age are also at increased risk for bleeding especially in the infants &lt;3-month-old population [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">17</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR32" role="doc-biblioref">32</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR33" role="doc-biblioref">33</a></span>]. Harwood et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR34" role="doc-biblioref">34</a></span>] reviewed 107 blind percutaneous biopsy and found no differences in number of needle passes or complication rates between obese and nonobese children. Pietrobattista et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR35" role="doc-biblioref">35</a></span>] reviewing ultrasound-guided biopsies with more than half described as obese also found no increased rates of complications with 79% of all patients needing only one needle pass.</p><p class="Para" id="Par23">It is worth noting that the pediatric data for many of the listed risk factors is limited by small retrospective studies. A 2019 review of predictors of bleeding complication after percutaneous liver biopsy by Midia et al., which included both adult and pediatric data, had comparable conclusions on these risk factors [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR36" role="doc-biblioref">36</a></span>].</p></section>

Given this patient’s oxygen requirement, lung auscultation or imaging should also rule out the rare complication of pneumothorax.</p><p class="Para" id="Par25">Persistent indicators of hypovolemia—tachycardia and/or hypotension—or persistent pain or irritability should alert providers to possible rapid decompensation, and the workup and resuscitation are comparable to an acute penetrating trauma. Additional vascular access should be obtained, type and cross sent, and the blood bank notified. Immediate imaging should be done either with ultrasound or stat computed tomography, and an interventional radiologist or general surgeon should be contacted for further management.

Many institutions started with an overnight observation period given the concern for the rapid decompensation that can occur in pediatric patients. With a better understanding of the risk factors for complication as well as evidence of the low rate of complications even in pediatric patients, most institutions have shifted to outpatient percutaneous liver biopsies. And several authors have published their institutions’ safety and success with a shift to outpatient practices [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR18" role="doc-biblioref">18</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR34" role="doc-biblioref">34</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR38" role="doc-biblioref">38</a></span>]. In the 2015 position paper on liver biopsy in children, authors recommended an initial postprocedural 2-h fasting period with at least a 6-h PACU observation [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par30">Several investigators have suggested even shorter observation periods. In Govender et al.’s 2013 study, the authors reviewed their institution’s policy where all patients had hematocrit levels drawn 4 <span id="ITerm31">h</span> after an ultrasound-guided biopsy [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR33" role="doc-biblioref">33</a></span>]. Those with stable hematocrits were discharged after 4 h, and the authors found no complications in these early discharge patients. Alomari and colleagues recently published their findings in 2020 paper on their quality improvement initiative to decrease the observation period from 4 to 2 h and eliminate the routine follow-up hematocrit. They likewise found no increase in complications or readmissions and demonstrated a significant cost reduction [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR39" role="doc-biblioref">39</a></span>]. Hayatghaibi et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR13" role="doc-biblioref">13</a></span>] also proposed that a 2-h observation period after ultrasound-guided livery biopsy was sufficient for children based on their institution experience.</p><p class="Para" id="Par31">While there is growing excitement for the “fast-tracking” of pediatric patients for liver biopsies, we should embark on this trend with caution. At the end of this patient’s procedure, the care team felt confident that he had a very routine and uneventful ultrasound-guided liver biopsy. Hemostatic agents were administered prophylactically. His anesthetic was uncomplicated, and he was transferred to PACU with no hemodynamic <span id="ITerm32">respiratory</span> or other clinical concerns. Even this patient’s right shoulder pain at first glance would be unremarkable as both incision and referred shoulder pain are common in the post-biopsy course. However, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">this lone clinical symptom</em> can portend a more serious complication.
