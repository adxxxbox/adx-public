A sleep study was not done. He snores every night, and his mother has noticed that he gasps and holds his breath. However, he starts breathing again on his own without his mother having to wake him up. He has a good appetite, but daycare staff have reported that he seems to be sleepier than other children. The child is scheduled to be observed overnight in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) as a 23-h stay due to his age, severity of symptoms, and parental preference.</p><p class="Para" id="Par3">Surgery was uneventful under general anesthesia, consisting of propofol, dexmedetomidine (1 mcg/kg), fentanyl (0.2 mcg/kg), acetaminophen (15 mg/kg), and sevoflurane (3%). He received dexamethasone and ondansetron, as well as 200 mL of Lactated Ringer’s solution. You are called by the PACU nurse to assess this patient about 3 h after arrival. His nurse reports that he has vomited four times in the past hour, with vomitus becoming more bright red like fresh blood with each emesis. The child has consumed 4 ounces of apple juice and a popsicle. He is now awake and crying, with bright red blood visible on the lips and tongue. His parents are near him and appear anxious.</p><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec2"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">1.1 </span>How will you prepare this child for surgery? Do you keep the patient on his mothers lap?</h3><p class="Para" id="Par4">As more medical providers approach this child’s bedside to examine him, a 3-year-old child will inevitably become more anxious and frightened, leading to crying and increased bleeding. If the patient is kept on continuous monitoring with pulse oximetry and vital signs are stable, he should be allowed to remain on the parent’s lap. However, the venous catheter should be checked for patency and further secured if needed. Furthermore, the parent and the PACU nurse should be instructed to stop feeding the child at this point. The anesthesiologist may help expedite the otolaryngologist’s evaluation of the tonsillar pillar including a quick look with flashlight and inform the anesthesiologist-in-charge of a potential emergent return to the operating room (OR) to assure staffing and OR availability. A recent study at our tertiary care children’s hospital found that in patients presenting with <span id="ITerm1">post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage (PTH)</span>, the longest mean time to OR occurred in the morning, 119.7 min (SD 101.5), versus all other periods of the day [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par5">Tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy is one of the commonly performed surgeries in children. In the <span id="ITerm2">United States</span>, it is estimated that over 500,000 cases took place in patients &lt;15 years of age in 2006. Indications for tonsillectomy include recurrent throat infection and sleep disordered breathing [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>]. <span id="ITerm3">Sleep disordered breathing</span> is estimated to occur in 12% of children. Although in-laboratory polysomnography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of <span id="ITerm4">obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)</span>, this test is inconvenient and expensive. In fact, only about 10% of children undergo polysomnography prior to their adenotonsillectomy. Indications for polysomnography include complex medical conditions such as <span id="ITerm5">Down syndrome</span>, <span id="ITerm6">craniofacial anomalies</span>, <span id="ITerm7">sickle cell disease</span>, <span id="ITerm8">obesity</span>, etc. Tools such as questionnaires, clinical parameters (restless sleep, apneic pauses observed by caregivers, daytime sleepiness, and/or hyperactivity), and physical exam findings are more often used by otolaryngologists to determine the need for surgery [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></span>]. Our patient’s low-for-age weight (10 kg, &lt;5th percentile for age), apneic pauses during sleep, and daytime somnolence indicate clinically significant sleep disordered breathing that has been affecting his growth and development. Anesthetic considerations for <span id="ITerm9">adenotonsillectomy</span> with <span id="ITerm10">sleep disordered breathing</span> as an indication include increased risk of ventilatory suppression from opioids. One study found almost double the level of respiratory suppression from opioids in these patients as compared to healthy controls. The <span id="ITerm11">American Society of Anesthesiologists</span> has recommended reducing the amount of opioids by half in children and adults with OSA. This increased sensitivity to the respiratory depressive effects of opioids, as well as the increased attention brought to deaths in rapid metabolizers of codeine [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></span>], has shifted the perioperative management of tonsillectomies toward reducing narcotics or avoiding them altogether in severe cases of OSA. Between 1969 and 2012, there were ten deaths and three overdoses in children treated with codeine reported to FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System. Eight of the 13 cases occurred in children after adenotonsillectomy. There is now a black box warning to the drug’s label stating that codeine is contraindicated for treatment of pain in children after tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy.</p><p class="Para" id="Par6">Otolaryngologists have stopped prescribing codeine for postoperative pain after tonsillectomy. Anesthesiologists have been utilizing <span id="ITerm12">IV acetaminophen</span> and <span id="ITerm13">dexmedetomidine</span> to supplement inhalational agents as part of a <span id="ITerm14">balanced anesthetic technique</span>. Other anesthetic considerations for tonsillectomy include its higher risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting compared to other pediatric surgeries, occurring in up to 70% of children [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par7">Whether the procedure is performed on an outpatient or inpatient basis depends on patient age, comorbidities, and indication for the surgery. In 2019, the <span id="ITerm15">American Academy of Otolaryngology</span> recommended inpatient admission and overnight observation after tonsillectomy for patients who are less than 3 years old or have severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index ≥10 obstructive events/hr. and/or SaO<sub>2</sub> nadir &lt;80%) [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></span>]. Most patients generally tolerate <span id="ITerm16">tonsillectomy</span> under general anesthesia without any complication, but occasionally patients present with PTH that requires surgical exploration and treatment. PTH that occurs in the first 24 h after surgery is considered primary and after 24 h, a secondary hemorrhage, with an estimated incidence of 0.6–0.7% for primary and 0.8–3.0% for secondary hemorrhage [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>]. A fraction of these patients require revision surgery. An older study from the <span id="ITerm17">Hospital for Sick Children</span>, Toronto, that examined 9409 healthy children ≤17 years old who were observed overnight after tonsillectomy, found the incidence of PTH to be 2.15% (202 patients), but those requiring a second anesthetic for hemostasis was only 0.06% (6 patients) [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR6" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></span>]. Most PTH is secondary, after the fibrin clot has detached from the tonsillar fossae. Secondary PTH peaks between postoperative days 4 and 7 [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></span>]. Factors that have been proposed to be associated with an increased risk of PTH have included surgeon inexperience, patient age, operating technique, and intraoperative blood loss [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par8">Our clinical scenario in the PACU is primary PTH and requires immediate attention. Although uncommon, PTH has potential to be life-threatening due to its brisk nature. Younger children less than 8 years of age have been shown to be more susceptible to severe PTH, that is, bleeding that leads to hemorrhagic shock, blood transfusion, ligature of the internal carotid artery, packing of the pharynx, tracheostomy, embolization, or resuscitation. With their lower total blood volume, PTH in younger children has the potential to become life-threatening earlier than the same amount of bleeding in an older child or adult [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">9</a></span>]. With a blood volume of about 700 mL (70 mL/kg × 10 kg), 200 mL of blood loss, for instance, would be significant in a 10 kg toddler but not a 70 kg, 16-year-old.</p><p class="Para" id="Par9">At the end of tonsillectomy, the otolaryngologist typically passes an orogastric tube to evacuate any stomach contents, including residual swallowed blood. Blood vomited in PACU may be old blood from the surgery or may be active bleeding from the tonsillar pillars. Most of the blood from PTH is swallowed rather than spat out, and so an accurate estimate of blood loss is difficult. A patient who is vomiting blood after <span id="ITerm18">tonsillectomy</span> requires immediate physical examination by the otolaryngologist. As the surgery team is being called to the bedside, the patient’s disposition and fluid status should be assessed. Mental status appropriate for developmental age, vital sign trends, capillary refill time &lt;2 s, and urine output, indicated by the number of wet diapers in this toddler, will assist in assessing his volume status. Hemodynamic compromise will occur when about 40% of the total blood volume has been lost. New, unexplained tachycardia and pallor may indicate that significant blood loss has already occurred before hypotension becomes apparent [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></span>]. Prompt hydration with isotonic crystalloid solutions such as lactated Ringer’s or normal saline is indicated to support hemodynamics. <span id="ITerm19">Complete blood count (CBC)</span> and type and screen should be sent. A bedside point of care (POC) hemoglobin can provide rapid results to guide management while waiting for lab results. If bleeding is ongoing and profuse, particularly in the case of this young patient with a smaller total blood volume, crossmatch of red blood cell units as well as a coagulation profile should be considered early in the evaluation phase. For torrential PTH due to <span id="ITerm20">arterial bleeding</span>, uncross matched emergency release red blood cells may be indicated. Rates of <span id="ITerm21">blood transfusion</span> for PTH have been reported as low as 0% to as high as 0.7% for all age groups [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></span>].</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec02"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">1.2 </span>How will you manage loss of peripheral IV access? </h3><p class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild" id="Par10"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">The patient is being examined by an otolaryngology team, receiving 100 mL (10 mL/kg) of Lactated Ringer’s bolus over 30 min while tubes for blood work are being prepared. At this point you notice that the peripheral intravenous (PIV) access has ceased to work, the child is crying, with bedside monitor alarms going off very loudly, and everyone around including the child’s parents are appearing very distressed. You are called to bedside for an intravenous catheter placement. There are no obvious veins visible on this child’s chubby extremities.</em></p><p class="Para" id="Par11">Reestablishment of <span id="ITerm22">intravenous access</span> is of the highest priority. Children, particularly those under 3 years of age, have a thicker layer of subcutaneous fat and pose a challenge in peripheral IV cannulation [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></span>]. In this child with difficult IV access and full stomach, sedation is not an option to facilitate IV access. Instead, speed is of the essence in this deteriorating clinical picture. Routine use of near infrared vein-viewing devices for peripheral IV access in children has not been shown to reduce time or number of attempts to successful cannulation [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR12" role="doc-biblioref">12</a></span>]. However, such studies often do not account for <span id="ITerm23">inter-operator variability</span> and individual facility with using the device and so should be considered if difficult intravenous access is anticipated depending on the operator’s experience. <span id="ITerm24">Ultrasound guidance</span> by the anesthesiologist most adept at using this to assist in PIV placement is an option as well, although studies on ultrasound-guided PIV placement on children with and without difficult PIV access have been mixed [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR13" role="doc-biblioref">13</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR14" role="doc-biblioref">14</a></span>]. If the patient must return to the operating room urgently and no IV access can be obtained, intraosseous access will be a faster and more feasible option than central venous access. Although most often used in the emergency room during resuscitation, intraosseous access devices are a part of the <span id="ITerm25">pediatric advanced life support</span> algorithm and available in operating rooms for code situations. Maximum flow rates of up to 10 mL/min under gravity and > 20 mL/min under pressure from an infusion pump and 10 mL/min for blood transfusion have been reported via the intraosseous route [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR15" role="doc-biblioref">15</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par12">The otolaryngology attending has diagnosed an area of brisk venous bleeding and posts the case as an emergency exploration to stop the tonsillar bleed. Peripheral IV access has been obtained in the saphenous vein after a single blind attempt. Point of care hemoglobin measures 10 g/dL on two readings. The child is still stable and alert on the mother’s lap, with an emesis basin of bloody vomitus nearby. The patient has by now received 200 mL of Lactated Ringer’s intraoperatively and 100 mL of Lactated Ringer’s in the PACU, with 5% dextrose 0.45% sodium chloride solution also infusing at a maintenance rate of at 40 mL/h. Complete blood count and crossmatch are being sent. You return to the operating room to set up the anesthesia machine and necessary equipment for an urgent re-exploration for the bleeding site in OR.</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec3"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2 </span>What Are Some Special Considerations for Intraoperative Management?</h2><p class="Para" id="Par13">Unless the PTH is a potentially catastrophic arterial bleed, induction of anesthesia should commence after fluid resuscitation to avoid hemodynamic instability at induction. <span id="ITerm26">Intravenous midazolam</span> may be administered to achieve anxiolysis without sedation immediately before transporting the child to the operating room. Although inhalation induction of general anesthesia and intubation in the left lateral position for PTH have been described [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR16" role="doc-biblioref">16</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">17</a></span>], this technique has fallen in disuse and is not considered. Considerations at anesthesia induction for PTH include <span id="ITerm27">hemodynamic instability</span>, hypoxemia, aspiration, and difficult intubation. A 2010 retrospective cohort study of PTH found that transient hypoxemia was the most common complication, with 9.9% of the 475 patients studied suffering hypoxemia although most occurred during emergence and extubation. In this same study, aspiration of blood into the glottis occurred in 0.8% of patients but was not associated with respiratory complications. At induction of anesthesia, bradycardia and hypotension were seen in 4.2% and 2.5% of patients, respectively [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">17</a></span>].</p><div class="Para" id="Par14">Because of the potential for blood clots to obstruct the suction catheter, two suction systems should be set up. Anticipating and preparing for the presence of excessive blood in the posterior pharynx on laryngoscopy is essential to minimize time between <span id="ITerm28">anesthesia induction</span> and <span id="ITerm29">intubation</span> (see Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">1</a></span>).<figure class="Figure" id="Fig1"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO1"><img alt="" aria-describedby="d64e441" src="../images/516808_1_En_22_Chapter/516808_1_En_22_Fig1_HTML.jpg" style="width:23em"/><div class="TextObject" id="d64e441"><p class="Para" id="Par21">A photograph of the pharynx with visible blood lesions inside a patient's mouth, which is stretched by a jaw stretcher.</p></div></div><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Fig. 1</span><p class="SimplePara">Anatomic View.

Cuffed endotracheal tubes of various sizes should also be prepared as interval airway swelling may necessitate a smaller endotracheal tube than was initially used for surgery.</p><p class="Para" id="Par16">The anesthesiologist should plan for <span id="ITerm31">rapid sequence intubation (RSI)</span> with an induction agent (usually propofol) followed by succinylcholine, ideally after preoxygenation via face mask as the patient permits. Gentle bag mask ventilation with 1.0 FiO<sub>2</sub> at low pressures ≤12 cm H<sub>2</sub>O without cricoid pressure after induction of general anesthesia, rather than the classical RSI technique with cricoid pressure and apnea modeled on adult anesthesia, may be considered in order to allow continued oxygenation, curb hypercarbia, and prevent atelectasis [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR18" role="doc-biblioref">18</a></span>]. A 2019 retrospective audit of 110 surgical revisions in 103 children with PTH showed that compared to children who underwent classical RSI, patients who underwent modified RSI with gentle mask ventilation after anesthesia induction had less severe hypoxemia (defined as SaO<sub>2</sub> &lt; 80%), better view on laryngoscopy, and less hypertension at induction [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR19" role="doc-biblioref">19</a></span>]. If the anesthesiologist does choose to use cricoid pressure at induction, gentle pressure of 10 Newtons (N) is recommended before general anesthesia is fully induced, increasing to 30 N after the patient loses consciousness. This is because a pressure of 20 N is painful in awake patients and can result in retching [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR20" role="doc-biblioref">20</a></span>]. If the child is actively retching and vomiting, placing him in a slight left lateral position might help drain the blood to the dependent portion allowing the anesthesiologist to have a better visualization of the larynx during laryngoscopy after propofol and succinylcholine administration. In cases of active vomiting, cricoid pressure is contraindicated since it can result in esophageal rupture. Vomiting creates esophageal pressures in excess of 60 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, and cricoid pressure would raise the intraesophageal pressure to dangerous levels in this situation [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR20" role="doc-biblioref">20</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par17">More recently, <span id="ITerm32">apneic oxygenation</span> administered via simple nasal cannula with low flow oxygen at a minimum of 0.2 L/kg/min up to 10 L/min [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">21</a></span>] has been proposed as a change in routine practice at national meetings and in anesthesia literature to minimize desaturation during laryngoscopy in children. Due to their higher <span id="ITerm33">oxygen consumption</span> and relative lower functional residual capacity, smaller children are uniquely more vulnerable to hypoxemia during laryngoscopy [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR22" role="doc-biblioref">22</a></span>]. In our case, apneic oxygenation will provide a longer intubation window as conditions may be suboptimal due to airway swelling and secretions despite not being difficult to intubate previously. In this 10 kg patient, nasal cannula oxygen flow should be at least 2 L/min.</p><p class="Para" id="Par18">After induction and intubation with a cuffed 4.0 endotracheal tube and reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration to below 30% to minimize risk of airway fire, the operating room table is turned 90 °. The surgeon identifies one area of venous bleeding on the right tonsillar area and cauterizes it. The team waits an additional 10 min to look for signs of rebleeding and decides to pass an orogastric tube to evacuate swallowed blood. There are clots in the stomach, but most cannot be evacuated as the suction catheter keeps getting obstructed. Vital signs are stable.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec4"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">3 </span>What is the plan for emergence and recovery?</h2><p class="Para" id="Par19">Barring major complications at induction such as <span id="ITerm34">aspiration</span>, the vast majority of PTH patients are extubated at the end of the case. Patients should be extubated wide awake as they are still considered full-stomach candidates. Whether they can return to PACU for overnight observation or should go to the intensive care unit depends on the extent of blood loss and potential for <span id="ITerm35">hemodynamic instability</span>. The presence of many clots suggests more swallowed blood than initially estimated. Obtaining a postoperative CBC and POC hemoglobin in the meantime is reasonable. Other diagnostic modalities to support the lab findings and supplement estimates of blood loss include <span id="ITerm36">POC gastric ultrasound</span> as some studies have found good correlation between gastric antrum cross-sectional area and gastric volume, although these studies were done for gastric emptying time for food and drink rather than swallowed blood from bleeding in an emergency setting [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR23" role="doc-biblioref">23</a></span>]. In any case, all PTH patients should be extubated awake.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec5"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">4 </span>Summary</h2><p class="Para" id="Par20">Vomiting of blood in the PACU after tonsillectomy requires prompt assessment to evaluate for PTH. In a young patient with a smaller total blood volume, adequate medical treatment is essential to avoid major adverse sequelae. Our patient’s PTH occurred in the PACU within the first 24 h after surgery, so was primary PTH by definition. Because it was not the torrential type of <span id="ITerm37">arterial bleeding</span> that can quickly deteriorate into a life-threatening situation, there was time to assess the patient’s volume status thoroughly and prepare for a controlled return to the OR. Patients who are discharged home and present later with secondary PTH should be questioned about aspirin or ibuprofen use in the interim. Although <span id="ITerm38">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications</span> such as <span id="ITerm39">ibuprofen</span> and <span id="ITerm40">ketorolac</span> have not been shown to increase bleeding, ketorolac is rarely administered intraoperatively for this surgery, while ibuprofen and acetaminophen are often prescribed as discharge medications [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></span>]. While rare, PTH remains a potentially lethal complication of <span id="ITerm41">tonsillectomy</span>. Particularly in practice settings other than large children’s hospitals, simulation would be a valuable tool to review the anesthetic considerations for PTH and practice troubleshooting different case scenarios. These include difficult IV access, evaluation of volume status, difficult airway due to blood and airway swelling, and post-anesthesia disposition planning [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR24" role="doc-biblioref">24</a></span>]. Simulation is a useful tool not only in training residents on PTH management but also as a continuing medical education exercise for attending anesthesiologists.</p></section>
