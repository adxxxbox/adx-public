He does not speak much and flaps his hands when agitated, and his vital signs are not obtained because he refuses placement of any monitors. He takes melatonin for sleep and lives at home with his siblings. He is nonverbal and uncooperative, makes no eye contact with any one, and is anxious around strangers. He remains in his street clothes refusing to wear the hospital gown or to take oral premedication. The mother is adamant that he does not get a premedication shot especially since he already had an unpleasant experience of getting an IM shot of ketamine before a brain MRI study earlier. At that time, he had woken up screaming and inconsolable and seemed afraid. His birth history and neonatal and infancy period are significant for delay in achieving physical milestones, speech delay, and failure to gain weight due to his poor eating habits.</p><p class="Para" id="Par8">The anesthetic induction plans A and B, as well as maintenance of general anesthesia with an LMA, were discussed in detail with the mother who wished to be present with him for the anesthetic induction.</p><p class="Para" id="Par9">The plan A discussed was induction with a facemask in the procedure room with the patient on his mother’s lap followed by an intravenous line prior to placement of an LMA. Plan B was to squirt DEX into the nostril since the mother did not want any intramuscular injections.</p><p class="Para" id="Par10">In the procedure room, he sat on his mother’s lap, who was given specific instruction to hold his hands in hers to encircle him while the child life specialist showed him his favorite video. As soon as the mask flavored with chocolate (as per mom’s request) carrying oxygen and 6% sevoflurane was gently placed over his face, he screamed and attempted to wiggle out of his mother’s arms. Since his mother was also distressed and unable to hold him, the anesthesiologist had to abandon plan A and resort to plan B.</p><p class="Para" id="Par11">Plan B was to administer nasal DEX by squirting it from a small syringe into his nostril. The syringe had a blunt-tip laryngeal atomizer which was primed ready for administration with the appropriate dose, 3 mcg per kg (total 60 mcg). While he was playing his video game with the child life specialist who was able to distract him once again after a few minutes of crying, the premedication was rapidly and expertly squirted into one of his nostrils with the mother and nurse holding him and the anesthesiologist approaching him from behind. The speedily administered nasal dexmedetomidine caused the child to scream and struggle for some time, but this time the hold on him was firm and there was no danger of him falling or hurting himself or others. Since the mother had been warned in detail about this quick nasal drug administration technique in plan B, this stealthy approach from behind the patient did not take her by surprise and she was able to help. Although he continued to cry, it was evident after about 5–7 min that he was getting a bit drowsy. He was moved slowly with the mother’s help to the stretcher, and the monitors were placed prior to securing an IV and airway for the procedure. The mother was then escorted out of the procedure room to the parent waiting room by the child life specialist. The anesthetic induction continued with oxygen and sevoflurane while an intravenous line was started on his hand and covered with Coban self-adhesive wrap to secure it for postoperative need.</p><div class="Para" id="Par12">An LMA was placed following administration of 30 mg of propofol and secured and his head was placed in the midline position. The audiologist proceeded placing appropriate electrodes on the scalp and each ear lobe to initiate the <span id="ITerm1">brain auditory evoked response test</span> (Figs. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">1</a></span> and <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2">2</a></span>).<figure class="Figure" id="Fig1"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO1"><img alt="" aria-describedby="d64e274" src="../images/516808_1_En_25_Chapter/516808_1_En_25_Fig1_HTML.png" style="width:23.02em"/><div class="TextObject" id="d64e274"><p class="Para" id="Par70">A photograph of a patient in a hospital bed appearing anesthetized.

The heart rate was high shortly after placement of monitors in the OR and came down to the range of 60–80 per minute, and his BP was 80/50 to 90/54 with normal spontaneous ventilation and 100% oxygen saturation.</p><p class="Para" id="Par14">At the end of the 30-min procedure, he was placed on his side or lateral (recovery) position, LMA was removed, and the intravenous line was disconnected from the IV fluids. The Coban-covered intravenous catheter was secured further and covered with a cotton sock, taped well to prevent him from pulling it out in PACU.</p><p class="Para" id="Par15">On arrival in the PACU, he was taken to a side room with minimal noise, and the handoff report to PACU nurse included details about his phobias, ASD features, previous anesthetic, type of <span id="ITerm5">anesthetic induction,</span> and need for his parents to be allowed early to be with him prior to emergence.</p><p class="Para" id="Par16">The parents were relieved to see their son lying on his side, with stable vital signs. His mother remarked that this was exactly how he was after the MRI but on awakening developed significant problems, pulling out iv catheter and monitors and screaming loudly. The heart rate on PACU admission was 80/min, blood pressure was 105/70, and respiratory rate was 20/min.</p><p class="Para" id="Par17">The anesthesiologist who was in PACU upon hearing this reminder from the mother about the previous anesthetic decided to give another dose of dexmedetomidine (0.5 mcg/kg to a total of 10 mcg) prophylactically (a “gilding-the-lily” situation), and that is when the unexpected hemodynamic response occurred. The patient’s heart rate slowed down to 60/min and further lowered to 38–40/min with the monitor beginning to alarm loudly and raising the anxiety of all those around the patient. The decision to give 0.1 mg (100 mcg) of glycopyrrolate (5 mcg/kg body weight) intravenously to prevent further lowering of heart rate was made, and the drug was immediately administered. The heart rate increased to 130 min, and the next blood pressure showed an alarming increase to 180/100. The BP cuff was then tried in all four limbs and showed the BP to be persistently high. Intravenous propofol was administered in doses of 1–2 mg per kg (20–40 mg, in 10 mg increments) with the patient lying on his side and an oxygen mask placed close to his face. The patient was sedated, spontaneously breathing, 100% oxygen by face mask, and his oxygen saturation was consistently normal throughout this period of significant hemodynamic fluctuations. The exaggerated BP increase was eventually brought down to a high normal level with a few more boluses of intravenous propofol (total of 160 mg in 30 min).</p><p class="Para" id="Par18">When his hemodynamic status was assessed to be normal after an hour, he was moved to his mother’s lap with the monitors still in place and the room lights dimmed for a smooth wake up. Eventually when he woke up, his mother held and rocked him. His father played his video, and the nurse watched the family from a short distance without approaching them or causing him any agitation.</p><p class="Para" id="Par19">The iv catheter was eventually removed an hour later with him crying during the process, and he was discharged 4 h later after monitoring for continuous hemodynamic stability. Despite the hemodynamic fluctuation after the treatment of bradycardia in the patient, the quality of wake up according to his mother was better than when he woke up after the anesthesia for his MRI.</p><p class="Para" id="Par20">The parents though anxious initially were able to be calmed down and they and the PACU nurse had several questions regarding the exaggerated BP increase with the treatment of bradycardia with intravenous glycopyrrolate.</p><div class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle3" id="FPar2"><div class="Heading">Key Questions</div><div class="Para FirstParaInFormalPara" id="Par21"><div class="OrderedList"><ol><li class="ListItem"><div class="ItemNumber">1.</div><div class="ItemContent"><p class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild" id="Par22"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">What happened to his HR and BP in PACU?</em></p></div><div class="ClearBoth"> </div></li><li class="ListItem"><div class="ItemNumber">2.</div><div class="ItemContent"><p class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild" id="Par23"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Could you have avoided this HR/BP problems by choosing another drug for anesthetic induction and maintenance?</em></p></div><div class="ClearBoth"> </div></li><li class="ListItem"><div class="ItemNumber">3.</div><div class="ItemContent"><p class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild" id="Par24"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">What can be done differently in the future?</em></p></div><div class="ClearBoth"> </div></li></ol></div></div></div></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec2"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2 </span>Discussion</h2><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec3"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2.1 </span>Autism and ASD</h3><p class="Para" id="Par25">The number children with <span id="ITerm6">autism</span> and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has risen in the last two decades. CDC researchers reported that autism rates in the USA increased from 1 in 150 children in 2000 to 1 in 54 in 2016 and stands at 1 in 44 today. Autism or autism spectrum disorder refers to a range of neurological developmental disabilities characterized by challenges in children with social and communication skills, repetitive behaviors, delayed speech, and often inability to make eye contact. Children with autism have difficulty with loud noises, bright lights, and crowds and often like to be left alone since they lack any interest in interacting with others around them.</p><p class="Para" id="Par26">Anesthesia induction in children with autism and autism spectrum disorders can be labor intensive for the perioperative team because of the difficulty in assessing the child, the lack of cooperation, and the frequent need to resort to pharmacological means to calm the child to induce anesthesia. Most parents who know their children’s lack of social skills can help with induction if they are given a clear <span id="ITerm7">understanding </span>of what to expect. This might sometimes require isolating one parent to explain these details, while the other may be exclusively trying to control the distraught child from escaping from the room.</p><p class="Para" id="Par27">Understanding their child’s need for a calm and safe induction of anesthesia, usually most parents call ahead to specify what the children will tolerate on arrival and what they will not. They may request a quiet room with a minimal number of health workers walking in and out of their child’s room. Parents are encouraged during preop phone calls to bring anything that might calm their child: a favorite blanket or pillow, a stuffed animal toy or a squeezy toy, to be with the child on anesthetic induction. If the child would take oral premedication, <span id="ITerm8">midazolam</span> can be administered to calm the child pharmacologically. In those children who will not take anything orally and will not let anyone come near them, intramuscular agents can be used by a stealth approach after explaining the process to the parent. <span id="ITerm9">IM ketamine</span> is a suitable agent for IM induction, but the dose required is usually 3–4 mg/kg to achieve quick onset of sedation which could result in prolonged sleep after a minor procedure. IM DEX is being used with good success and may be the newer option in these children. The drug of choice for induction of anesthesia is currently DEX which can be administered either by the nasal route or by the intramuscular route.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec4"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2.2 </span>Brain Evoked Auditory Response (BAER) Test</h3><p class="Para" id="Par28">Encountering autistic children for a hearing test by using <span id="ITerm10">brain evoked auditory response (BAER) test</span> is becoming more frequent in most surgical centers. The main problem of “questionable” hearing loss is because most autistic children behave apparently “deaf” to parents and family members by not responding to their name when called or to any other verbal commands. The <span id="ITerm11">ABR test</span> in these children tends to be perfectly normal and therefore of a much shorter duration because most of them have normal hearing pathways. The apparent lack of response is often interpreted by family as potential sensorineural deafness because of their inability to process and respond to verbal commands. Once the induction is over, the anesthetic management is unremarkable and brief. Infants, children, and developmentally delayed or challenged children require anesthesia or deep sedation to remain motionless, for these very brief noninvasive procedures. The challenge for the anesthesia provider is how to assess the child, to plan and execute a smooth anesthetic induction, maintenance, and emergence, focusing on patient safety and parental satisfaction. This can be labor-intensive, involving several members of the perioperative team to keep the child calm and safe from the time of arrival till he is wake and reunited with his family without hurting himself or others.</p></section>

The sedative properties of dexmedetomidine (DEX) are desirable because the effects are very similar to natural sleep by its acts on the locus caeruleus, a nucleus in the pons of the brainstem involved with physiological response to stress and panic and a part of the reticular activating system.</p><p class="Para" id="Par39">Compared to sedatives like ketamine, DEX produces less secretions and does not have paradoxical reaction like midazolam. Intravenous route is commonly used, but intranasal administration of DEX is gaining popularity for anxiolysis and moderate sedation in children without intravenous lines.</p><p class="Para" id="Par40"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Intranasal administration</strong> of <span id="ITerm12">DEX </span>is less invasive than an intravenous route, and if parents have been warned and prepared about that route of administration, it can be useful in calming children as a preinduction agent. DEX is an effective sedative drug for noninvasive procedures like BAER, CT, MRI, nuclear medicine scans, ECHO, and EEG studies. DEX has minimal effect on respiratory depression in healthy children especially when a nasal route is utilized.</p><p class="Para" id="Par41">A prospective observational study was undertaken to evaluate the use of nasal DEX in children 6 months to 18 years with an ASA status I or II, undergoing noninvasive procedures such as radiological studies, electroencephalography, echocardiography, and BAER. The researchers reported that a dose of 3mcg/kg of DEX administered nasally as a sole agent or in combination with nasal midazolam had a very high success rate of sedation in 92% of patients [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>]. Previous studies have shown that DEX produces bradycardia and hypotension in patients, and secondary to its effects on the α<sub>2</sub>-adrenoreceptor, DEX can also decrease cardiac output, as clonidine does.</p><p class="Para" id="Par42">Another double-blind study compared nasal DEX (3mcg/kg) to nasal midazolam (0.3 mg) in 162 <span id="ITerm13">children </span>undergoing CT scans and found more decreases in HR and BP with DEX group but more decreases in oxygen saturation with midazolam group. They concluded that DEX 3mcg/kg is superior to midazolam in faster-onset sedation satisfaction by parents and physicians and with fewer side effects [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par43">Comparison of sedative effects of oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg to nasal DEX 2.5 mcg/kg in 59 children aged 1–6 years similarly showed children in the DEX group having better Ramsay Sedation Scores during their CT scans compared to the midazolam group [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par44">In 100 children aged 2–12 years, with ASA status I and II undergoing elective surgery, the onset time and duration of sedation of DEX were found to be 25 and 85 min, respectively. The overall satisfactory sedation at the time of intravenous cannulation attempt in children was only 62% perhaps due to the lower nasal DEX dose (1 mcg/kg) used [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par45">Nasal delivery of DEX is achieved using an atomizer or drops from a syringe.</p><p class="Para" id="Par46"><span id="ITerm14">Mucosal atomization</span> devices help efficient delivery of atomized solution to the nasal mucosa which is absorbed rapidly and taken up into the systemic circulation. A comparative study of these two nasal delivery methods, namely, atomizer and syringe, showed similar effectiveness [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par47">Intramuscular route of delivering DEX (mean: 2.4–2.9 mcg/kg) was reported to be successful in producing sedation with mean time to achieve sedation of 13 min, in 65 children undergoing CT and MRI [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR6" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par48"><span id="ITerm15">Randomized double blind controlled trials</span> comparing the use of nasal DEX (3mcg/kg) to other sedatives like oral chloral hydrate (50 mg/kg) specifically for <span id="ITerm16">auditory brain response (ABR)</span> showed the distinct advantages of DEX. A higher incidence of testing completion with a single dose with shorter time to desired sedation level and return to baseline activity on the same day were seen in those receiving <span id="ITerm17">DEX</span> compared to oral chloral hydrate [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par49">Another study compared the sedative effects of oral chloral hydrate 50 mg/kg with intranasal DEX (3 mcg/kg) with buccal midazolam (0.1 mg/kg) for ABR testing. Intranasal DEX and buccal midazolam group had higher sedation success as well as deeper level of anesthesia compared to the oral chloral hydrate group with similar discharge times [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">9</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par50">A systematic review of literature on the use and effect of intranasal DEX in children for ABR testing was undertaken by a study group in Italy. They reviewed all six articles published between 2016 and 2021 on the use of DEX in ABR testing, and the results were published early this year. The results showed high sedation effectiveness and success with DEX in all but one study. The dose used was 3 mcg/kg and the comparative groups in three studies used oral chloral hydrate [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par51">Another systematic <span id="ITerm18">review meta-analysis based on the Cochrane Review methods</span> included 1168 participants in 13 randomized controlled studies and evaluated the effect of intranasal DEX as a premedication in children. DEX provided satisfactory sedation at parent separation than other premedication agents requiring less rescue analgesics. In addition, DEX produced less nasal irritation and postoperative nausea and vomiting compared to other premedication drugs [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par52">A retrospective data collection <span id="ITerm19">on</span> 17,948 children in a tertiary hospital in China reported that combining DEX and ketamine administered nasally was effective with a success rate of 93% for sedation and low rate of adverse events during diagnostic studies [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR12" role="doc-biblioref">12</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par53">Many studies with DEX have shown transient <span id="ITerm20">hypertension</span>, <span id="ITerm21">bradycardia,</span> and <span id="ITerm22">hypotension secondary</span> to its peripheral vasoconstriction and sympatholytic properties. DEX activates the central pre- and post-alpha 2 receptors in the locus caeruleus and produces hypnosis and unconsciousness. The size of the body, hepatic function, plasma albumin, and cardiac output have significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of DEX [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR13" role="doc-biblioref">13</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par54">Incidence of bradycardia with the use of DEX in children has been an area of interest to many researchers. Meta-analyses of 21 studies evaluated 2835 patients for this phenomenon of bradycardia after the use of DEX. They found that the incidence of bradycardia in dexmedetomidine-treated pediatric patients was 3%. In the <span id="ITerm23">meta-regression analyses</span>, the patient’s age, body weight, and DEX dose were not significantly associated with the incidence of bradycardia. The minimum heart rate observed during treatment with DEX however was positively associated with the patient’s baseline heart rate [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR14" role="doc-biblioref">14</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par55">DEX has tremendous usefulness <span id="ITerm24">as</span> a sedative agent for anesthesia induction whether it is administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or intranasally. Selection of types of cases, concomitant drugs, and total dosage used is important to avoid the incidence of bradycardia and other hemodynamic adverse events. The incidence of bradycardia and the risk factors for bradycardia after intranasal administration were studied in 9984 children who underwent noninvasive studies. The overall incidence of bradycardia after sedation with intranasal DEX was 2.3% with normal blood pressure with male children showing a 1.48-fold higher risk. Children who received additional doses of DEX had more incidences of bradycardia compared to those who had a single dose. Simple wake up was effective in managing the bradycardia [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR15" role="doc-biblioref">15</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par56">A case report of vasovagal syncope and severe bradycardia after the administration of intranasal DEX for sedation in an 11-year-old girl undergoing voiding cystourethrogram highlights the importance of continuing EKG monitoring in these patients for a longer period even if consciousness and vital signs are back to pre-sedation levels [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR16" role="doc-biblioref">16</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par57">The effect of DEX on cardiac conduction tissue in children undergoing electrophysiological studies showed significant depression of both sinus and AV node function. This was evidenced by prolongation of the sinus cycle length, sinus node recovery time as well as AV nodal effective refractory period, Wenckebach cycle length, and ventriculo-atrial block cycle length. Arial excitability was decreased by DEX by increasing the atrial refractory period.</p><p class="Para" id="Par58">Despite the absence of spontaneous AV nodal block, the researchers cautioned the use of DEX in children at risk for bradycardia or AV nodal dysfunction [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">17</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR18" role="doc-biblioref">18</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par59">A case report of profound bradycardia with the use of DEX as a sedative infusion in the pediatric ICU in a 5-week-old infant on a ventilator with the diagnosis of AV canal and acute RSV should serve as a warning to avoid its use in infants on digoxin [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR19" role="doc-biblioref">19</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par60">A review paper by Mason and Lerman <span id="ITerm25"/>in 2011 summarized the knowledge of DEX gleaned from many studies and concluded that DEX is an effective sedative, analgesic, and anxiolytic in children, maintaining the airway with minimal respiratory depression and decreasing shivering postoperatively. However, varying degrees of bradycardia, hypotension, and hypertension can still be evidenced depending on the age of the child and the dose administered. Recovery from DEX, which has a 2-h elimination half-life, may be protracted compared to the other sedatives. Appropriate monitoring and prompt interventions can maintain the continual safe use of DEX children without adverse cardiovascular complications [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR20" role="doc-biblioref">20</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par61">In a 2013 study published by Mason and her colleagues, the effect of DEX on children undergoing nuclear medicine scans was evaluated. DEX was administered as an intravenous bolus of 2 mcg/kg over 10 min followed by a continuous infusion of 1 mcg/kg/h, in 669 patients with 99.7% success. Hypotension, hypertension, and bradycardia (defined as deviations of more than 20% from age-adjusted awake norms) occurred in 58.7%, 2.1%, and 4.3% of patients, respectively. Both hypotension and bradycardia were related to age, with older children tending to experience more hypotension and bradycardia but not requiring any pharmacologic therapy [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">21</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par62">Another study by the same group <span id="ITerm26">reviewed</span> the database on 3522 children undergoing radiological imaging (MRI) to determine the incidence and the predictors of hypertension. The children who received high-dose DEX sedation showed a hemodynamic change in the form of hypertension. 4.9% of patients had hypertension with a higher incidence in the younger group (0–3 years) when compared to older children (3–18 years) and those who received more than one bolus. The conclusion of this study was that hypertension is most likely to occur in infants during continuous infusion and after receiving an additional bolus of DEX [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR22" role="doc-biblioref">22</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par63">When high doses of DEX are used, bradycardia can be severe. However, there is a need for caution before using an anticholinergic drug to counter this low heart rate. An anticholinergic like glycopyrrolate (5 mcg/kg) can increase the low heart rate and cause an exaggerated increase in arterial blood pressure. An interesting case report on three cases where the authors saw this unusual effect is worth remembering when one encounters profound bradycardia in children receiving high-dose DEX infusion [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR23" role="doc-biblioref">23</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par64">Currently, there are no guidelines to pilot one to treat or even pretreat a drop-in heart rate by using an anticholinergic, when DEX is administered. In a retrospective descriptive study, a group of researchers reviewed the records of 163 children receiving DEX infusion during the MRI studies followed by administration of an anticholinergic. The mean age was 94.5 months and 32% had the diagnosis of Down syndrome. During the scan, the heart rate and systolic blood pressure decreased when no anticholinergics were given. <span id="ITerm27">Heart rate</span> <span id="ITerm28"/>decreased by 26.6% in the non-pretreated patients compared to only 16.7% in the treated group. However, the systolic blood pressure increased significantly in the anticholinergic treated group compared to the untreated group (20.2% vs. 10.4%, respectively; <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em> = 0.02). The maximal systolic blood pressure increased significantly, compared with baseline, in the anticholinergic group in comparison with the non-anticholinergic group. In children with Down syndrome, this blood pressure increase was even more exaggerated, 36 times greater when anticholinergic was given compared to the blood pressure in children who did not receive the anticholinergic. The conclusion of this study is that prophylactic administration of anticholinergic shows no advantage other than a transient clinically insignificant increase in heart rate but may precipitate an exaggerated increase in systolic blood pressure in patients treated with anticholinergic [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR24" role="doc-biblioref">24</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par65">Despite the lack of approved pediatric labeling, DEX has been used almost daily in clinical practice in pediatric anesthesia and sedation services.

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec6"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">4 </span>Conclusion</h2><p class="Para" id="Par69"><span id="ITerm30">Dexmedetomidine</span> is an extremely valuable drug in the anesthesiologist armamentarium. DEX is unique in being able to be administered by different routes for induction of anesthesia. In children undergoing pain-free noninvasive sedation procedures, the use of this drug is unique. It is versatile and superior to other premedication drugs because of the quality of sedation it provides described as being similar to natural sleep. To continue the safety record of this off-label drug, it is important for those who prescribe this drug to be thoroughly knowledgeable about its mode of action and side effects and to choose the right patient and the right dose to achieve the desired sedation goal.</p></section>
