The preoperative nurse welcomes patients after they are registered, directing them and their families to assigned holding bays and evaluating, recording, and transferring information about the patient to surgeon, anesthesiologist, and the OR nurse.</p><p class="Para" id="Par3">The anesthesiologist is ultimately responsible for assessing each patient for appropriateness for surgery after the pre-op nurse’s initial assessment and for administering premedication whenever indicated. The anesthesiologist relies on the preoperative evaluation of each patient, derived from patient’s electronic medical records, preoperative interview, and physical examination of the patient, to plan and execute the optimal anesthetic technique for each case. Preoperative planning for induction, monitoring, and pain management with narcotics and/or regional blocks are all discussed with parents, before proceeding with anesthetic induction. When the anesthesiologist, surgeon, OR nurse, technician, and the pre-op nurse are all satisfied with necessary paperwork regarding consent, updated history, and physical and specific tests for the patient, then the induction of anesthesia is signaled to proceed. Anesthetic management, type of airway used, intraoperative use of drugs and intravenous fluids administered, blood loss, and urine output are recorded in the electronic chart during anesthesia in the OR and available for the PACU nurse even before patient reaches the PACU bay.</p><p class="Para" id="Par4">Patient’s vital signs (continuously monitored) and hemodynamic responses during induction, surgery, emergence, and extubation are data that are also recorded in the electronic chart. Even if the information about the anesthesiologist’s preoperative assessment, need for premedication, and anesthetic management of each patient is in the electronic record, this is again verbally repeated during handoff to the PACU nurse.</p><p class="Para" id="Par5">A very busy OR schedule may not allow sufficient time for the anesthesia provider to transfer all the vital information regarding the patient to the receiving PACU nurse. Incomplete and erroneous handoffs are well known to affect patient care and safety adversely. Information without a structured approach can result in the omission of vital patient medical information if the handoff time is brief and rushed. A well-structured method of handoff can assist each member in the perioperative team to focus on vital information related to each patient necessary for continuing care and safety.</p></section>

It is helpful in children and adults with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). A study looking at airway patency (stridor score by baseline recording) in children 1–10 years of age undergoing adenotonsillectomy under sevoflurane anesthesia showed that common airway maneuvers like chin lift and jaw thrust in the supine position increased airway patency.

Patient’s restrictions for oral intake will be specifically mentioned if the patient is supposed to remain NPO as in a patient who had abdominal surgery or in someone with a nasogastric tube in situ to prevent gastric distension from ileus or intestinal motility problems. Surgical team handoff will conclude with the plan for discharge from PACU to the floor or home, the take-home medications, local antibiotic drops, and specific instructions for the patient’s parents regarding activity, bath, wound care, and continuation of antibiotics.</p><p class="Para" id="Par58">After the surgical handoff is complete, the surgical team member will leave specific phone or pager numbers with the PACU nurse in case of urgent or emergent need to contact the surgical team member.</p><p class="Para" id="Par59"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Anesthesiologist handoff</strong><span id="ITerm24"/> will start with the introduction of the patient and the disease and what was done by the surgeon to correct or repair it. During the introduction of the patient, it is important to emphasize the age of the patient, weight, existing medical problems, and the specific reason for a higher ASA physical status due to deviation from normal health.</p><p class="Para" id="Par60">For example, in an obese patient with a BMI of 45, complicated with early-onset diabetes mellitus, long-standing hypertension, and somnolence from OSA, it is expected to detail these comorbid conditions to enable the nurse to understand the assignment of the higher ASA status of 3.</p><p class="Para" id="Par61">The patient’s developmental and psychological profile during the preoperative interview and the need for premedication use, parental presence during induction, and type of induction used are detailed to allow the PACU nurse a glimpse of how the patient was on induction. Report continues with description of patient’s intraoperative anesthetic course, emphasizing the type of anesthetic chosen: total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) vs general anesthesia with use of LMA or endotracheal tube, or mask anesthesia with oral airway. The intravenous fluid administered and type of anesthetic emergence specifying if the patient underwent a deep or awake extubation are all significant details that should be transferred to the PACU nurse for her to anticipate potential problems. Any regional blocks performed and the effectiveness intraoperatively should be another area to be detailed at this time.</p><p class="Para" id="Par62">Other significant details to mention include the type, amount of antibiotic, the patient’s response to it, and if there is a need for repeating another dose before discharge from PACU. Even if the surgeon may have mentioned about blood loss, it is important to repeat your assessment about the estimated blood loss during surgery. It is vital to specify if red blood cells were transfused and if a hematocrit value was done post-transfusion in the patient. The total amount of analgesics used, type of antiemetic used, performance of regional blocks (awake or under anesthesia), and the plan for pain management in the PACU are all additional information that should be transferred. It is equally important to emphasize why an antiemetic was omitted and why it should not be used if the patient had prolongation of QT interval and had developed arrhythmias in the past when given Zofran for antiemetic prophylaxis.</p><p class="Para" id="Par63">Another point to emphasize to the PACU nurse is regarding the patient’s sensitivity to pain medication. If the patient demonstrated extraordinary sensitivity to small doses of narcotics in the OR, as in a patient with OSA, a need to titrate small doses of narcotics or for avoiding it completely if other modalities of pain relief are available should be emphasized.</p><p class="Para" id="Par64">If there is a particular loose tooth in a child that the parent was concerned about before start of anesthesia, it is important to show its presence to the PACU nurse to confirm with the parent later. <span id="ITerm25">Taking</span> a quick picture of it may further enable you to show the parent presence of the loose tooth still intact in the mouth after the handoff was completed.</p><p class="Para" id="Par65">The intended surgery as written in the schedule if different from the performed surgery will also need to be reiterated to allow full understanding of the patient’s perioperative course. Detailed information will enable the PACU nurse to anticipate potential pain problems, anticipate emergence delirium, and understand the choice of drugs written for control of pain and/or for delirium as well as the degree of obstructive sleep apnea in an obese patient which was evident intraoperatively.</p></section>

The PACU (postanesthesia care unit) is a 35-bed unit that provides postanesthesia recovery to all ages from newborns to adults. Being a level 1 trauma center, we provide surgical care covering all pediatric specialties that do not require intensive care monitoring. Our typical OR schedule consists of 80 to 90 surgical cases a day. Our caseload is cared for by nurses with critical care experience combined with the expertise of NPs, PAs, AAs, and anesthesiologists. Bedside nurses that work in the PACU hold a BSN and have current PALS/BLS certification in addition to national certification from various pediatric associations (CPN, CCRN, APON, etc.). PACU RNs work in both surgical prep and postanesthesia care and provide on-call emergency recovery for unscheduled surgeries.</p><p class="Para" id="Par67">Orientation consists of precepted time in both pre-op and <span id="ITerm27">PACU</span>, didactic instruction by the educators, and an airway management skills day with an anesthesiologist providing direct care to pediatric patients undergoing anesthesia. PACU RNs provide hands-on airway skills and manipulation techniques under the direction of an anesthesiologist. Ongoing education is annually necessary consisting of but not limited to 8 h of burn education and 8 h of trauma in a 2-year period.</p></section>

The charge nurse in the PACU oversees the flow of the unit and assigns bays to the PACU nurse and times for lunch breaks, takes reports from the OR nurse, and distributes the patients to individual nurses on a rotation basis. In addition, the charge nurse handles any problems on the unit as they arise and is a resource to assist in the urgent need of a patient in the assigned nurse’s care.</p><p class="Para" id="Par74">In the PACU, patients are either discharged home (SDS (same-day surgery), sent to an inpatient unit, or allowed to stay in the PACU for 3 h or 23 h. There are protocols related to age and condition that determine if a patient is to be SDS or 23-h observation. Our PACU is set up in a manner where phase 1 and phase 2 patients are cared for in the same bay by the same RN.</p><p class="Para" id="Par75"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Phase 1</strong> patients sometimes have oral airways, are sedated, and require close monitoring of vital signs similar to critical care units. This phase lasts until the patient returns to baseline cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological status and preanesthetic wakefulness.</p><p class="Para" id="Par76"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Phase 2</strong> patients are those that that are in a transitional period of monitoring, instructions are given for postoperative care, and patient is transitioning toward transfer to the inpatient ward or home. Oral hydration is introduced, and oral intake tolerance is monitored. Caregivers are instructed in this phase as well.</p><p class="Para" id="Par77">Recommended staffing ratios alter according to the level of care the patient needs. Ratios should be 1:1 when the patient has an oral airway and is deeply sedated. The staffing ratio should be adjusted to accommodate the level of care and safety of the patient. Consideration should be given to the age of patient, specific procedure, and amount of pain medication needed to facilitate recovery and transition to phase 2.</p><p class="Para" id="Par78">Children under age 6 years without a parent should not be assigned to a nurse who is already taking care of a phase 1 patient for safety reasons. The developmental age as well as developmental baseline of the patient should be known beforehand prior to making staff assignments. In children with autism or autism spectrum disorder and in those with previous history of impulsive behavior, the need to have a caregiver present with them on arrival to the PACU is important for patient safety and comfort.</p><p class="Para" id="Par79">Of note, as a phase 1 patient is being transported to their assigned bay, the receiving nurse has been provided the necessary information about the patient by the charge nurse who has already received the pertinent information from the OR nurse. This is a critically important step that occurs prior to the patient being transported. The bedside RN may need to have additional suction setup for a chest tube or nasogastric decompression, IV fluid pumps, and invasive pressure monitoring. The PCT/RN cooperative role is essential in the gathering of necessary equipment to receive the patient in a timely manner.</p><p class="Para" id="Par80">The OR to charge nurse telephone <span id="ITerm33">handoff</span> should be precise and informative in specifics about the immediate needs of the patient. The receiving RN should be aware of the patient’s complete medical history and physical examination results prior to the patient leaving the OR after surgical procedure. All documents are available in the hospital’s computerized charting system. There are many handoffs in the process of caring for one patient as in a relay where the baton is passed efficiently from one team member to the other.</p><p class="Para" id="Par81">Pre-op nurse to OR nurse is the first part of the relay before the start of surgery, and from OR nurse to PACU charge nurse and the anesthesiologist passing patient information to the assigned PACU nurse is the second part of the relay. The passing of this vital information regarding the patient referred to as the “baton” in a relay cannot be allowed to slip and fall on the ground for the safety of our patient. The information needs to be concise and precise, and it is constantly being reevaluated and improved upon by our perioperative management team.</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec14"><h4 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2.1.3 </span>When a Patient Arrives at the PACU Bay After Surgery</h4><p class="Para" id="Par82">Into the bay rolls the stretcher led by the anesthesia-surgical team. The receiving nurse assists with proper alignment of the patient’s stretcher with the monitor to ensure easy access to the patient from both sides. After the brakes are applied, we monitor the cardiac/respiratory status, transfer the oxygen source to the wall, and assess the patient’s breath sounds. Working suction is available if needed to clear secretions. <span id="ITerm34">Temporal temperature monitoring</span> is available in all the bays and is monitored in all our patients. Temperature goal is >36 °C for optimal perfusion and hemodynamic stability in the pediatric patient. Double verification of the patient’s ID band with the accompanied chart is done after the patient is situated in the recovery bay, vital signs are stable, and it is safe to proceed. There is always continuous airway monitoring during handoff in the PACU. Assessment of breath sounds and supportive positioning of the airway are crucial for a safe recovery. Many times, especially following any ENT/oral surgery, we will position the patient on the lateral side to prevent laryngospasm especially if there is an oral airway in place. Once the patient is in a satisfactory recovery position (as agreed by the entire team), the process of the surgical handoff is begun. The anesthesiologist remains at the head of the bed during the surgical handoff.</p><div class="Para" id="Par83">An ideal handoff is depicted in the picture <span id="ITerm35">below</span> (Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig6">6</a></span>) a visual tool available to remind the perioperative team and if the surgical and anesthesia team members need to refresh themselves about the process of structured step-by-step handoff.

<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec15"><h4 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2.1.4 </span>Surgical Handoff</h4><p class="Para" id="Par84">Surgical hand<span id="ITerm37">off</span> consists of specifying the surgical procedure, findings, tubes/drainage devices, and a multitude of details that are unique to every specialty. It usually involves what type of surgery was done for the patient’s diagnosis, what was found, what was placed, and what is to be anticipated in the post-op period. Specifics include but are not limited to what is expected: drainage from a surgical site, position of patient (supine, prone, HOB elevated), position of EVD, hourly rate of IV fluids, post-op diet, medications, and destination (home versus inpatient). The incision sites are inspected by the receiving nurse, and additional warm blankets are provided for warmth to facilitate postanesthesia recovery. IV sites are checked as well as attachment of additional catheters or tubes identified in the handoff. Before the surgical team leaves the bedside, cell/pager numbers are exchanged for immediate communication as necessary from the recovery room.<span id="ITerm38"/></p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec16"><h4 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2.1.5 </span>Anesthesia Handoff</h4><p class="Para" id="Par85">The anesthesia hand<span id="ITerm39">off</span> follows the surgical handoff and includes intraoperative airway management LMA vs endotracheal intubation; type of anesthesia; use of muscle relaxants, medications, antiemetics, and antipyretics; and total amount of narcotics, including the timing of the last dose administered in the OR. Use of sedatives like dexmedetomidine, total amount of IV fluids given to the patient, antibiotic use, allergies, and patient preferences are discussed along with type of problems anticipated in the PACU stay. IV access and postanesthesia medications are reviewed by the anesthesia team that usually consist of a narcotic and second-line antiemetic for emergence, pain, or emesis in the recovery period. After this review with the PACU nurse, the anesthesia team departs when the patient is in a satisfactory recovery state and deemed hemodynamically stable.</p><p class="Para" id="Par86">From a PACU nurse’s point of view, efficient handover is important to reduce risk and harm to the patient. A cross-sectional study using Norwegian Handover Quality Rating Form (N-HQRF) which was used to assess the overall quality of handoff and getting feedback on nurse’s evaluation of the same showed interesting results. Despite the rating, the total perceived quality of handoff is high in most cases, there was great variation between transferring and receiving the nurse’s <span id="ITerm40">evaluation</span> of the same handoff. Lower-quality handoff was due to time pressure, lack of certainty, and patient-related problems. The conclusion from this study was that there exists a need to evaluate handoff quality from a much broader view. The circumstances surrounding the handoff will impact the quality, and therefore designing and implementing handoffs should consider the various circumstances that exist during the relay of information [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR15" role="doc-biblioref">15</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par87">The PACU-assigned anesthesiologist is asked to be present if the case has specific airway concerns during the recovery period (i.e., difficult airway, obstructive sleep apnea, need for bronchodilator during extubation, significant airway secretions, or even waiting for assigned intensive care unit bed).</p><p class="Para" id="Par88">Some of our patients have an airway surgical “stay” in the PACU for an assigned period as the ENT surgeon desires immediate access to the OR in event of a need to return urgently for a postoperative bleed after T&amp;A. We often receive otherwise healthy children with spinal scoliosis after spinal fusion (anterior or posterior) which is long in duration with significant blood loss who may have already received blood transfusion in the OR. These are 23-h cases in PACU and may have PCA orders for pain control. These are scenarios where it would be ideal for the PACU anesthesiologist to be present for the direct handoff given by the OR team to the PACU team.</p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec17"><h4 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2.1.6 </span>PACU Patient and Pain Treatment</h4><p class="Para" id="Par89">The <span id="ITerm41">PACU</span> nurse should have a thorough understanding of the patient’s pain threshold and response to intraoperative pain management including blocks performed and the assessment of its effectiveness. We have a pain management team in-house that is part of our anesthesia department. Longer and more painful procedures usually involve a postoperative PCA or quite possibly epidural anesthesia. These cases are communicated directly to our pain management team from our anesthesia team in the recovery room. The patient is evaluated while in the PACU before being dispositioned to the inpatient unit.<span id="ITerm42"/></p></section>
<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec18"><h4 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2.1.7 </span>Kids Are Not Small Adults</h4><section class="Section4 RenderAsSection4" id="Sec19"><h5 class="Heading">Respiratory Obstruction in PACU</h5><p class="Para" id="Par90"><span id="ITerm43">Approximately</span> one in ten children presents with respiratory complications in the PACU [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR16" role="doc-biblioref">16</a></span>]. The initial postoperative recovery period requires keen assessment skills by an experienced pediatric RN. Many of the early signs of respiratory complications in pediatric recovery can be ominous and elusive. Anticipation, vigilance in monitoring, and early intervention in recognizing obstruction of airway from a large tongue or from laryngospasm developing from secretions when patients are not awake and lying in a supine position are crucial. Oftentimes positioning, oral suctioning, and the use of an oral airway may help to prevent airway obstruction.</p><p class="Para" id="Par91">An important assessment skill is knowing and being familiar with upper versus lower airway breath sounds. Breath sounds are assessed often to make sure there is no upper airway obstruction as in croup or lower airway obstruction as in asthma with wheezing. One of the most common reasons for an Anesthesia Stat that can be detoured is the positioning of the patient on their side so the secretions drain out of the mouth. This is especially true following oral or ENT surgery, in patients that are at risk for obstruction with large tongue and excess oral secretions and in those patients extubated deep after general (endotracheal or LMA) anesthesia.<span id="ITerm44"/></p></section>
<section class="Section4 RenderAsSection4" id="Sec20"><h5 class="Heading">Croup</h5><p class="Para" id="Par92">Young <span id="ITerm45">children</span><span id="ITerm46"/> who may have been intubated at birth and dependent on a ventilator for weeks in the NICU may have a history of croup and may develop significant stridor after extubation. The handoff report may include this croup history and the reason for racemic epinephrine by nebulizer in the PACU orders despite the administration of Decadron in the OR. Often allowing parents to participate in this treatment maneuver is helpful to the patient and nursing team. Suctioning the oropharynx and monitoring a patient’s respiratory status, the frequency and depth of respirations, use of accessory muscles, and watching for appearance of retractions and/or nasal flaring along with decrease in oxygen saturations are important assessments frequently done by the PACU nurse. Knowing and being familiar with the early warning signs are key to avoiding a potential airway emergency.</p></section>
<section class="Section4 RenderAsSection4" id="Sec21"><h5 class="Heading">Emergence Delirium</h5><p class="Para" id="Par93">Similarly with <span id="ITerm47">emergence delirium/agitation,</span><span id="ITerm48"/> it is important to have information about the patient’s anxiety, pre-op reaction to anesthetic induction, and previous history of delirium—which are helpful clues to predict a stormy postoperative period. Identifying and treating a confused agitated child just emerging from anesthesia before they become wild and delirious will prevent a safety event, assault/injury for patient and staff which can affect the existing available manpower. It is vital for the PACU nurse to anticipate and recognize its occurrence early, to call for help to treat this escalating problem with an intravenous drug. Early intervention is important before the IV gets pulled out or nonfunctional in the ensuing struggle with an uncontrollable patient who is thrashing around. We have a PACU anesthesiologist <span id="ITerm49">available</span><span id="ITerm50"/> in the PACU area who usually has these drugs available and can administer dexmedetomidine or propofol to treat emergence delirium rapidly. Anticipation, vigilance, and early recognition and intervention are vital for prevention of delirium in susceptible children.</p></section>
<section class="Section4 RenderAsSection4" id="Sec22"><h5 class="Heading">Development of Shock</h5><p class="Para" id="Par94">A patient with an active infection (appendiceal abscess) may present to the emergency room with subtle signs of sepsis and undergo surgery in OR and may proceed to signs of septic shock in PACU in the immediate post-operative period. This is probably the most ominous sign in the pediatric population because their hemodynamic status can deteriorate very rapidly. Presence of cool clammy extremities is indicative of poor perfusion, along with tachycardia and hypotension with deteriorating oxygen saturation in a patient who is drowsy and lethargic. A patient with potential to develop impending shock needs immediate intervention to prevent morbidity and mortality. Calling for help from the anesthesiologist to help with airway support and oxygenation should be followed by checking a bedside evaluation of acid-base status, serum electrolytes, and sugar and administration of inotropes for improving cardiac output. An anesthesiologist with a team of healthcare providers at the bedside is essential to manage patient’s hemodynamic status, if septic shock is suspected. Additional placement of intravenous lines to increase delivery of fluids and inotropes and an arterial line for monitoring blood gases and to monitor the patient’s response to ongoing treatment is crucial to first stabilize and then plan for transfer of patient to ICU for continuous observation. If an intravenous line is difficult to access, an intraosseous line placement should be undertaken for immediate volume resuscitation.</p><p class="Para" id="Par95">Similarly simple hypovolemic shock in a patient who had an uneventful liver biopsy in OR and is now bleeding internally in PACU can be a very subtle presentation. A high degree of suspicion, early intervention, and informing the anesthesia and surgical team members to obtain an ultrasound imaging of the liver at the patient’s bedside to confirm a diagnosis while administering fluids and blood are all necessary ways to decrease the possibility of hypovolemic shock from occurring.</p></section>

<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec23"><h4 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2.1.8 </span>Drug Administration in PACU</h4><p class="Para" id="Par96">Additional attention and dual <span id="ITerm51">verification</span> of all pediatric dosages of narcotic or other classified medications are mandatory prior to their administration in the PACU. These medications are considered high alert for several reasons, especially in the younger or premature infant. Postoperative apnea after anesthesia is common in the young, particularly premature infants, and can be potentiated with use of opioids/benzodiazepines. Barbiturates and opioids also have a longer duration of action due to an infant’s slower metabolism and immature hepatic system.</p><p class="Para" id="Par97"><span id="ITerm52"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Temperature regulation</strong></span> is a challenge post-anesthesia in the younger child and infant due to the large surface area to weight ratio and minimal subcutaneous fat. This can lead to bradycardia and hemodynamic instability. Infants and small children also have poorly developed sweating and shivering mechanisms. Heat loss can be exaggerated in this age group and active measures should be taken to prevent hypothermia. In the PACU we often use warm blankets but also have access to IV fluid warmers as well as forced warm air devices.</p><section class="Section4 RenderAsSection4" id="Sec24"><h5 class="Heading">Hypoglycemia</h5><p class="Para" id="Par98">Low blood <span id="ITerm53">sugar</span><span id="ITerm54"/> is common in the premature babies, stressed infants, newborns of diabetic mothers, as well as those pediatric patients with mitochondrial or metabolic disorders. For this reason, we monitor the glucose regularly in all patients that are at high risk for alterations in glucose metabolism and use specific infusions to prevent it. These include children who have been fasting for a prolonged period or have a history of failure to grow as well as those who are vomiting.</p></section>

<section class="Section3 RenderAsSection3" id="Sec25"><h4 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2.1.9 </span>Autism and Autism Spectrum Disorders</h4><p class="Para" id="Par99">Special consideration is given to our <span id="ITerm55">autistic</span> and autistic spectrum <span id="ITerm56">disorder</span><span id="ITerm57"/> patients in both the pre-op arena and in the PACU. Referred to as the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Keep Me Calm</em> initiative, these patients are identified by our child life specialists with a screening tool that is done prior to surgery. Some children on waking up from anesthesia often complain of noises around them being loud. Loud noises can produce autonomic changes as in a stress reaction and can aggravate their discomfort. In children with autism, the preoperative experience itself begins in a quiet room with the goal of decreasing sensory stimulation. All team members are briefed by the child life specialist leading the transition to the OR, sometimes allowing parents to accompany the patient until induction of anesthesia. The PACU is aware of the patient’s status and all efforts are made to recover these children in a quieter, less stimulating manner.</p><p class="Para" id="Par100">The nurses at CNMC PACU work in a very collegial cohesive manner with the anesthesia and surgical team to improve the care of each patient after surgery.</p><p class="Para" id="Par101">Anecdotally, it was the PACU nurses at CNMC who brought a significant clinical finding to children’s anesthesia team about caudal block effectiveness in the children postoperatively<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">. They said almost with certainty that they could predict which of their patients had a good caudal block by one single repeatedly observed phenomenon</em>. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Every patient who had a very lax anal sphincter tone when the nurse inserted a Tylenol suppository invariably did not mind the insertion and woke up comfortable without needing any pain medicine in PACU.</em> This finding by these clinically astute PACU nurses prompted the anesthesia team to prospectively study this phenomenon occurring in children undergoing caudal blocks, and the results were affirmatory and therefore published in a paper in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia</em> [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">17</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par102">The days of rectal suppositories in PACU are gone and forgotten, but this clinical observation by the PACU team and follow-up with anesthesia team are an example of harmonious supportive perioperative teamwork at CNMC which is invaluable for optimal patient care!</p><p class="Para" id="Par103">Finally, the perioperative team at CNMC who care for our pediatric patients include many people in the hospital. It takes a multitude of hospital employees and health workers to undertake the care and safety of each patient scheduled for surgery. There are numerous perioperative services to plan, organize, and implement the safe arrival and departure of our young patients who need to undergo their surgical procedures under general anesthesia in a timely, efficient, and safe manner. Open communication among perioperative team members, constant vigilance in monitoring our patients during their surgical and PACU stay, and working as a strong dedicated team are the essential factors needed to provide premier care to all our patients at CNMC.</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec26"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">3 </span>Conclusion</h2><p class="Para" id="Par104">Handoff must be complete and efficient describing the patient’s pre-op medical condition, ASA status, drug allergies, intra-op course, drugs administered and anticipated airway problems, pain thresholds, and specific written orders for PACU. Certain critical patient information can be repeated for emphasis during OR to PACU transfer. PACU staff members often write down these in a piece of paper during the verbal handoff. In critical clinical situations, it may be necessary to ask the nurse receiving this information or specific instructions to repeat it back to assure that the message was clearly understood as in a closed-loop communication. Finally, for our patients’ continuing care, each of us in the perioperative team must identify our role in running this relay race with the baton of information to the finish line by focusing on that single prize: our patients’ comfort and safety.</p></section>
