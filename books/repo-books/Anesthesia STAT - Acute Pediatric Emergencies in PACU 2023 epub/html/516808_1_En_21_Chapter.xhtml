Parents speak only Spanish and through a video Spanish interpreter her medical history was gathered. Her past medical history included reactive airway disease, frequent upper respiratory infections <span id="ITerm1">(URIs),</span> and many ear infections from age 2. Her surgical history includes two sets of bilateral myringotomy tubes placed at age 2 and 4, when she also underwent <span id="ITerm2">adenoidectomy</span>. Four weeks ago, she had a runny nose (rhinorrhea) which resolved but she did not have fever nor an associated cough. The patient’s younger brother is currently sick at home with a cough and fever. From the parents’ report, she has had no issues with anesthesia or surgery in the past. Both parents reported that there was no anesthesia-related death in their respective families. Dad did volunteer that his uncle who had emergent surgery did not make it out of the operating room due to complications during surgery. However, he did not have any details regarding that death. The patient has <span id="ITerm3">no known drug allergies (NKDA)</span>. She does not currently take daily medications. Her only preoperative test was a COVID-19 negative PCR.</p><p class="Para" id="Par3">She was appropriately nervous, but the amount of <span id="ITerm4">midazolam</span> to reduce anxiety that was given PO was much less than the dose intended for her, because she threw up the oral premed a few minutes after the administration. She had a difficult inhalation induction with a combination of nitrous oxide at 70% and 6% sevoflurane. After placing an <span id="ITerm5">intravenous (IV) catheter</span>, <span id="ITerm6">oxymetazoline spray</span> was sprayed intranasally into both nostrils for vasoconstriction. The anesthetic was deepened with a bolus of propofol. The nasal intubation was traumatic with the blood pooling in the back of the oral pharynx. A cuffed endotracheal nasal (RAE) tube was placed via the right nostril with confirmed auscultation of bilateral breath sounds and the cuff inflated immediately. Unfortunately, crackles were heard in the right lung field. A <span id="ITerm7">suction catheter</span> was inserted, and scant amount of blood and pink-colored oral premed was removed. After some positive pressure breaths, the nasal RAE tube was suctioned again with the removal of a small amount blood. The crackles resolved and a quick lavage of the lungs with normal saline was done. The <span id="ITerm8">lavage fluid</span> was suctioned out and appeared clear without any blood. Though the lungs were clear on auscultation, the compliance of the lungs was reduced. Discussion about cancelling the procedure between the dentist and the anesthesiologist ended when the dentist pointed out that the parents were not compliant about the child’s dental care. And it was with much difficulty that the parents had finally agreed to come for this scheduled surgery. The case finally started based on the need for treating the child’s dental caries without postponement.</p><p class="Para" id="Par4">Since the beginning of the anesthetic, she had been tachycardic and hypotensive. Since she had been NPO for a long time, this was treated with a fluid bolus of <span id="ITerm9">lactated Ringer’s solution</span>. After 150 cc of <span id="ITerm10">lactated Ringer’s solution</span>, the hypotension resolved but her heart rate remained high, ranging 115–120 beats per minute. The anesthetic maintenance plan was for one minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane and less than 1 mcg/kg of fentanyl because of the planned dental extractions. Ondansetron was given prophylactically to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting <span id="ITerm11">(PONV)</span>. Local injection of lidocaine with epinephrine was given prior to extractions, and she responded with tachycardia and hypertension. Since she had mild oozing from the extracted teeth, the postop order to give intravenous ketorolac was discontinued.</p><p class="Para" id="Par5">The <span id="ITerm12">dental procedure</span> was completed eventually. There were some episodes of sudden tachycardia and desaturation which resolved with manual ventilation. Prior to extubation, auscultation revealed mild wheezing bilaterally. She was then given multiple doses of albuterol within the breathing circuit. The wheezing improved. The plan was for an awake extubation. Upon emergence, the patient coughed repeatedly, and the endotracheal tube had white secretions which became more apparent when she coughed. Suctioning the nasal RAE tube produced thick white secretions. After these coughing spells, the patient would remain apneic. After four episodes of coughing followed by apnea, the patient finally opened her eyes and attempted to self-extubate and remove the nasal RAE tube. The nasal RAE tube was eventually removed by the provider and patient was turned on her side to lie in the lateral (recovery) position.</p><p class="Para" id="Par6">Unfortunately, the patient began coughing again and it was clear that she was not exchanging air effectively. She was quickly returned to the supine position. A jaw thrust was attempted with positive pressure ventilation <span id="ITerm13">(PPV)</span>. But her chest rise was minimal, and no end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> was recorded. PPV was attempted until the saturation began to decrease below 94% and then IV propofol was administered to break the laryngospasm. However, during the movement from recovery position to supine, the IV had become dislodged. Immediately, 3 mg/kg of succinylcholine (45 mg) was given intramuscularly into the left deltoid muscle. The <span id="ITerm14">laryngospasm</span> was relieved eventually, and her oxygen saturation improved with PPV. A second IV was successfully replaced. After several minutes, the patient returned to breathing spontaneously with an occasional cough; she was placed again in the recovery position to allow for drainage of secretions. When vital signs were stable and she was breathing well without coughing or pauses, the patient was transported to the post-anesthesia recovery room under some blankets.</p><p class="Para" id="Par7">During the hand-off to the recovery room nurse, the heart rate was 122 bpm, and the blood pressure was 110/89 and the temperature was 37.9 °C. The anesthesia team attributed the elevated temperature to the warm blankets and that it was perhaps this higher temperature which caused the increased heart rate and BP. Instructions were given to allow her to emerge lying on her side and to monitor her vitals closely.</p><p class="Para" id="Par8">The <span id="ITerm15">anesthesia team</span> was called back to bedside of the patient after 15 min because she now had a heart rate of 130 bpm and blood pressure was still elevated at 120/92, and her temperature was 40.1 °C. She still coughed on occasion with some crackles in the right lower lobe. She had no blankets on her and a cool compress was placed on her forehead by the PACU nurse. She was drowsy but not fully awake.</p><p class="Para" id="Par9">The nurse asks the question for clarification, if IM atropine was also given along with succinylcholine IM injection and it was affirmed that only succinylcholine was given and that the effect of tachycardia was perhaps due to the warm blankets.</p><section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec1"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">1 </span>What Is the Differential Diagnosis and Workup for Fever for this Postoperative Patient?</h2><p class="Para" id="Par10"><span id="ITerm16">Postoperative fever</span> is not uncommon following surgery. The most obvious cause in the postoperative period is an infectious process from a surgical site infection, respiratory pathology, or urinary tract infection. Another very common reason for gradual rise of temperature during full dental rehabilitation surgery in children could be covering the patient with impermeable drapes and warm blankets. Effective means of cooling efforts to decrease the rise in temperature and to preserve normothermia include ambient forced-air cooling using tent-like draping [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>]. Other causes of fever can be related to the inflammatory process of surgery, the physiologic stress of surgery, phlebitis, postoperative anemia, drug reaction, or very rarely malignant hyperthermia [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>]. The onset and rate of rise of the fever can provide a wealth of information about the cause of the fever.</p><p class="Para" id="Par11"><span id="ITerm17">Fevers</span> within the first few hours of surgery are more commonly secondary to inflammatory changes. The amount of damage to tissue during surgery is directly correlated to the amount of circulating inflammatory markers like Interleukin-6 (IL-6). The higher amount of <span id="ITerm18">inflammatory makers</span> has direct effect on the severity of the fever in the first few hours after surgery [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></span>]. Fortunately for patients, fevers related to inflammatory charges are usually short lived with minimal sequalae. For patients with fever who are hemodynamically stable, the cause is most likely due to inflammatory changes. Treatment is usually temperature control with <span id="ITerm19">antipyretics</span>. Other more insidious causes of immediate postoperative fever are malignant hyperthermia, pulmonary embolism, necrotizing soft tissue infections, and adrenal insufficiency. These are fortunately rare in occurrence.</p><p class="Para" id="Par12"><span id="ITerm20"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Malignant hyperthermia</strong></span> is a lethal medical condition associated with exposure to inhalational anesthetic agents and succinylcholine (a depolarizing muscle relaxant). After exposure to one of these triggering agents, a hypermetabolic response is triggered. This leads to fever, increase in heart rate, increase in end-expired carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) despite increases in minute ventilation, and muscle rigidity. The fever can rise dramatically 1–2 °C every 3–5 min. Treatment requires prompt diagnosis and treatment with dantrolene [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par13"><span id="ITerm21">Pulmonary embolism</span> can lead to immediate postoperative fever. This is usually low-grade fever. The cause of the embolism could be septic thrombophlebitis. Patients with pulmonary embolism typically complain of shortness of breath and chest pain. They are tachypneic, tachycardiac, hypotensive, and hypoxic and have low-expired CO<sub>2</sub>. Diagnosis is usually based on computed tomography (CT), and treatment is mainly supportive (vasopressors and ventilatory support) and anticoagulation [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par14">Necrotizing soft tissue infections usually present with very high immediate postoperative fever and pathognomonic physical findings such as “dishwater drainage,” edema, induration, and extreme pain. Prompt surgical treatment is needed with drainage, antibiotics, and supportive therapies.</p><p class="Para" id="Par15">Lastly, <span id="ITerm22">adrenal insufficiency</span> can present as an immediate postoperative fever. The associated signs and symptoms are not specific. A careful review of the patient’s medical is warranted. Adrenal insufficiency can be primary leading to direct damage to the adrenal gland. It can also be secondary adrenal insufficiency, which is more common from hypothalamic pituitary disease-causing hypopituitarism. <span id="ITerm23">Secondary adrenal insufficiency</span> can be caused by exogenous or endogenous steroids causing suppression. Treatment is supportive therapy along with steroids and treatment of any electrolyte disturbances [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par16">Timing of the onset of the fever is key. Other more common causes of fever are wound infection, atelectasis, pneumonia, urinary infection, phlebitis in the immediately postoperative period, and occasionally sepsis if the wound was already infected prior to surgery. These causes are most likely seen after the first postoperative day and not in the recovery unit. To determine the cause of immediate hyperthermia in PACU, anesthesiologists need a focused diagnostic workup, including labs and radiologic studies.</p><p class="Para" id="Par17">For our patient, her fever occurred immediately after surgery. This does narrow the differential diagnosis. More focused investigation is warranted to decide the next course of action.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec2"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2 </span>Could This Immediate Postoperative Fever Be Due to Inflammatory Changes?</h2><p class="Para" id="Par18">The cause of her fever could be <span id="ITerm24">from</span> inflammatory changes. <span id="ITerm25">Dental surgery</span> can cause some trauma to the gums; however, the trauma in dental surgery is minor typically and does not cause as much tissue damage like an open bowel surgery. A high fever might be more expected in an open bowel surgery because of the amount of tissue damage and higher inflammatory response. <span id="ITerm26">Tissue damage</span> is minimal to the gums during dental surgery, and a large inflammatory response would not be likely seen. If she was hemodynamically stable and this was just inflammatory response, the expectation would be a low-grade fever which would be self-limiting. If the fever continued, a short course of antipyretics could be helpful to decrease the fever. Our patient’s fever was high in PACU and continued to rise which is not very typical for fever related to inflammatory changes. A clinical study to detect the risk of bacteremia from nasotracheal intubation in children undergoing dental treatment under general anesthesia reported the most common bacteria in positive cultures to be <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Streptococcus</em> <span id="ITerm27">viridans</span> [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR6" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></span>]. Another study compared the use of antibiotics and placebo in children (mean age: 3.5) undergoing <span id="ITerm28">dental extractions</span> under general anesthesia and reported the incidence of bacteremia to be significantly high in the placebo group. <span id="ITerm29">Bacteremia</span> occurred from a variety of bacterial species mainly Gram-positive cocci and for a longer <span id="ITerm30">duration</span> after dental extractions. <span id="ITerm31">Amoxicillin</span> was shown to have a significant impact on the incidence, nature, and duration of bacteremia after nasal intubation; dental restorative, and cleaning procedures; and dental extractions [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></span>].</p></section>

The disorder is dependent on exposure to a triggering agent. Halogenated anesthetics and succinylcholine, a depolarizing muscle relaxant, are the known triggering agents for MH. The usual clinical presentation is tachycardia, increased CO<sub>2</sub> production, hyperthermia, and rigidity.</p><p class="Para" id="Par20"><span id="ITerm35">Tachycardia</span> can be due to many other factors in the postoperative setting. Tachycardia is a nonspecific sign and can be related to pain from surgery, secondary to hypotension/hypovolemia, fever from infection, medications, emergence from anesthesia, or anxiety.</p><p class="Para" id="Par21">The increased CO<sub>2</sub> <span id="ITerm36">production </span><span id="ITerm37"/>is <span id="ITerm38">because </span>of the hypermetabolic process that occurs in MH. MH causes a dysregulation of the calcium channel in the skeletal muscles leading to contraction and rigidity. Eventually, this leads to depletion of ATP stores and metabolic acidosis. Under general anesthesia this is typically discovered by rising end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> concentration despite adequate or increasing minute ventilation. In the postoperative period, patients may have a rise in minute ventilation to compensate for the metabolic acidosis which may not be noticeable.</p><p class="Para" id="Par22"><span id="ITerm39">Hyperthermia</span> can be the first or one of the last signs of MH. In a study by Larch et al., 63.5% of presentations of MH had hyperthermia as one of the first three signs of the disorder [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></span>]. Like tachycardia, it can be attributed to many other factors. During a MH crisis, the increase in temperature can be quite dramatic, typically increasing 1–2 °C every 3–5 min [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></span>]. Severe hyperthermia above 41 °C can lead to multiorgan system failure, DIC, and death.</p><p class="Para" id="Par23">Other clinical signs include muscle <span id="ITerm40">rigidity</span><span id="ITerm41"/>,<span id="ITerm42"/> contractures, myoglobinuria from myocyte death, and rhabdomyolysis. Muscle rigidity is a very specific sign of MH, presenting in 50–80% of patients [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">9</a></span>]. Late clinical signs include hypoxia, altered mental status, pulmonary edema, cardiac arrythmias, electrolyte abnormalities like hyperkalemia, heart failure, and disseminated intravascular disseminated (DIC) [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">9</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par24">For our patient, she presented <span id="ITerm43">with </span><span id="ITerm44"/>the nonspecific signs of tachycardia and fever. She was exposed to two triggering agents during the case, an inhalational anesthetic (sevoflurane) and IM <span id="ITerm45">succinylcholine</span> (a depolarizing neuromuscular blockade). In the recovery room, since she was not intubated, it would be hard to accurately quantify her CO<sub>2</sub> production. However, we can use her respiratory effort as a reflection of her minute ventilation and use a nasal cannula with a CO<sub>2</sub> side port to assess her breath-by-breath CO<sub>2</sub> on the monitor. If her respiratory rate was elevated, it could be evidence that she is compensating for the increased CO<sub>2</sub> production. The dramatic rise in temperature over a short period of time is key in deciding if this is a MH crisis. Because MH has high morbidity and mortality if untreated, diagnosis and treatment should be promptly initiated for MH patient.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec4"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">4 </span>Did This Child Have Risk Factors for Malignant Hyperthermia?</h2><p class="Para" id="Par25">The incidence of MH <span id="ITerm46">is</span> reported between 1:10,000 and 1:250,000 in all ethnic groups. It is seen in males more often and young people with the median age of 18.3. MH can present after the first exposure to a triggering agent but on average usually presents during the third exposure to a triggering agent [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></span>].</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec5"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">5 </span>Pathophysiology of MH</h2><p class="Para" id="Par26">Malignant <span id="ITerm47">hyperthermia</span> shows an autosomal dominant pattern with incomplete penetrance and variable expression. The prevalence of a genetic mutation which makes someone susceptible to MH is 1:2000 to 1:3000 [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></span>]. The most common and studied mutation is on chromosome 19 which is also the genetic coding site for the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RYR1). A defect in the excitation-contraction coupling of calcium in the sarcolemma in the muscle causes uncontrolled rise in myoplasmic calcium when a patient with this mutation is exposed to triggering agents. This abnormal increase triggers numerous biochemical activities including <span id="ITerm48">hyperkalemia</span> and <span id="ITerm49">rhabdomyolysis</span> from increased permeability of the muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum from low levels of ATP. This dysregulation of calcium channel in the skeletal muscle fibers results in persistent muscle contraction and rigidity [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par27">For our patient, her family history was unfortunately vague and incomplete. There was a reported death on <span id="ITerm50">the</span> paternal side of the family related to emergency surgery, but it was unclear if this was related to MH. It was not feasible for the team to attempt to get the previous anesthetic/surgical records of a distant relative. Our patient had two prior anesthetic exposure and is likely to have had exposure to one of the triggering agents in the past. Since she has many factors which put her at risk for MH, we believed that MH is the most probable cause of her fever.</p></section>

If untreated, as the <span id="ITerm53">skeletal muscle</span> continues to contract, both metabolic and respiratory acidosis progress with depletion of ATP stores leading to rhabdomyolysis. This leads to myocyte death resulting in hyperkalemia and myoglobin in the urine. The electrolyte disturbance of significant hyperkalemia (more than 6 mEQ) can lead to cardiac arrythmias. The rise in CPK levels in patients with MH will peak in 12–24 h after the MH episode to more than 20,000 I.U. Plasma and urine myoglobin can increase, and if not aggressively treated, myoglobinuria can lead to acute renal failure. The elevated temperature can lastly lead to <span id="ITerm54">disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)</span> and death. Prompt treatment is needed to prevent this MH cascade. For our patient, since MH is high on our differential diagnosis list, treatment was initiated to prevent morbidity or mortality.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec7"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">7 </span>How Do You Treat MH?</h2><p class="Para" id="Par31"><span id="ITerm55">Treatment of </span>MH in the operating room begins with discontinuation of triggering agents. If a patient is still undergoing general anesthesia with inhalational anesthetic agents, this should be changed to a <span id="ITerm56">total intravenous anesthetic technique (TIVA)</span> and strict avoidance of succinylcholine. Insertion of activated charcoal filters on both the expiratory and inspiratory limbs of the anesthesia circuit will help prevent further exposure. Under <span id="ITerm57">general anesthesia</span>, the treatment also includes ventilation with 100% oxygen at high flows to flush the anesthesia circuit and hyperventilation to compensate for rising CO<sub>2</sub> from the hypermetabolic state.</p><p class="Para" id="Par32">Dantrolene (Ryanodex, Dantrium) is <span id="ITerm58">the</span> primary treatment for treating MH. The dose is 2.5 mg/kg given every 5 min and repeated if signs and symptoms of MH are persisting. It may be given by continuous infusion 0.25 mg/kg/h until the patient is hemodynamically stable and the hypermetabolic state subsides. This usually presents as decreasing heart rate, decreasing temperature, and decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> production. There is no upper limit of dantrolene dose; however, if greater than 10 mg/kg is administered, an alternate diagnosis should be considered [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></span>]. <span id="ITerm59">Dantrolene</span> is a muscle relaxant which antagonizes the ryanodine receptor and slows the release of calcium in skeletal muscle. Dantrolene currently comes in two formulations. The older preparation is a 20 mg vial which dissolves in 60 cc of sterile water (slowly and poorly) and therefore very difficult to reconstitute in an emergency. The new preparation is in a concentrated form of 250 mg/5 cc of sterile water and therefore is easy to reconstitute. The newer formulation allows for ease of use and utilizes 1 vial only necessary for an average-sized adult. The potential side effects of dantrolene include weakness, dizziness, rash, phlebitis, and fatigue. If the patient is not intubated, care should be taken to watch for respiratory compromise and the need for respiratory support. The typical weakness seen with dantrolene is seen in the extremities. Dantrolene has reduced the mortality of MH from the high 70% in the 1970s to less than 5% in 2008 [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par33">After dantrolene is <span id="ITerm60">administered</span> successfully, recrudescence can occur within the next 24–48 h, and additional dantrolene may be given with a dose of 1 mg/kg every 4–6 h [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">9</a></span>]. Therefore, monitoring is warranted for 24 h for any patient with an MH crisis. Fever is usually the first sign identified if the patient has recrudescence.</p><p class="Para" id="Par34">Treatment of MH also includes active cooling techniques if temperature is greater than 39 °C. This usually involves surface cooling with ice packs, forced cold air cooling, and cold IV fluids, and ice-cold gastric lavage is advocated in extreme cases. These cooling techniques should be stopped as soon as temperature reaches 38 °C. Antipyretic <span id="ITerm61">medications</span> are not useful in treating the hyperthermia during a MH crisis.</p><p class="Para" id="Par35">The remainder of the treatment is to deal with the consequences of the hypermetabolic state. It is recommended to obtain an arterial blood sample to guide treatment of the metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate (1–2 mEq/kg/dose) if acidosis is profound. <span id="ITerm62"/>The most common electrolyte abnormality is hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia is usually treated with calcium (calcium chloride 10 mg/kg or calcium gluconate 10–50 mg/kg), sodium bicarbonate (1–2 meq/kg/dose), and glucose/insulin. And in severe cases of hyperkalemia, alternative treatment options include albuterol, dialysis, and ECMO. <span id="ITerm63">Ventricular arrythmias</span> including ventricular bigeminy, V tachycardia, and fibrillation are also common. This may require treatment with antiarrhythmics like intravenous lidocaine infusion or amiodarone. In addition, MH can cause acute renal failure because of the myoglobin in the urine. Maintaining adequate urine output with fluids, mannitol (0.25 g/kg IV), and furosemide (1 mg/kg) and continuous monitoring in ICU are recommended.</p><p class="Para" id="Par36">For our patient, her clinical presentation in the PACU was highly suspicious of MH. Since MH has a high mortality and morbidity, prompt treatment is necessary. Since she was extubated, her treatment should include respiratory support with 100% nonrebreather mask, prompt treatment with dantrolene 2.5 mg/kg, and active cooling techniques. Careful observation of her respiratory status is warranted because of the respiratory acidosis and the effects of dantrolene as a muscle relaxant. If it becomes necessary, respiratory support with a breathing tube and ventilation may be needed. It would be necessary to start an additional peripheral IV for medication, A-line placement to monitor her degree of acidosis, and frequent laboratory testing which <span id="ITerm64">should </span>include electrolytes like potassium, creatine kinase, and coagulation studies. She would need to be monitored in the intensive care unit for the next 24–48 to first stabilize her but also to watch for recrudescence. She may need additional dosages of dantrolene if the fever recurs. It is helpful to contact the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States (MHAUS) during the treatment of a MH crisis especially if this occurs after hours in an emergency case to obtain support from MH expert on this disease [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR12" role="doc-biblioref">12</a></span>].</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec8"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">8 </span>Is There a Definitive Test to Confirm Diagnosis for MH?</h2><p class="Para" id="Par37">The clinical presentation <span id="ITerm65">and</span> supporting laboratory tests form the basis for diagnosis of a MH event. Researchers from the MHAUS (<span id="ITerm66">Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States</span>) did develop a clinical grading scale to help in research and evaluate those patients who need more specific and sensitive diagnostic tests. The scale requires the provider to score the degree of five parameters: rigidity, muscle breakdown, respiratory acidosis, temperature, and cardiac involvement [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR13" role="doc-biblioref">13</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par38">Since there is no “gold” standard test for MH, the best test for MH is in vitro contracture test (IVCT). This involves exposure of muscle tissue usually taken from the vastus muscle of the thigh under local anesthesia and propofol infusion to halothane and/or caffeine in vitro. In susceptible patients it produces an exaggerated muscle contracture. It is expensive and requires a surgical procedure under anesthesia (TIVA) and/or regional nerve block to obtain the tissue. This is done only in a few centers around the world. This test is the most sensitive and often done when the child is older than 5 years old [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></span>]. A negative result rules out diagnosis of MH. But the test does have a high false-positive rate of 20%. This test cannot be done immediately after a MH crisis.</p><p class="Para" id="Par39"><span id="ITerm67">Genetic testing</span> can also be used to look for mutation on specific chromosomes which are known to be <span id="ITerm68">related</span> to MH. Genetic testing has less than 50% sensitivity. There are three outcomes of genetic testing. The first is if a known mutation is identified, then the patient would be identified as MH susceptible. The second outcome could be that a <span id="ITerm69">DNA variation</span> is identified with unknown significance. In those instances, patients would also need to be identified as MH susceptible. Lastly, the genetic results could have no known DNA mutations, but this does not rule out MH because only a small percentage of mutations are known. Genetic testing just like in vitro contracture test is quite expensive and completed in only specialized centers around the world [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par40">For any patients who have had a MH crisis, any future surgeries/anesthetics should be performed with nontriggering agents with strict avoidance of inhalational anesthetic agents and succinylcholine. Barbiturate, opioids, propofol, benzodiazepines, nitrous oxide, anticholinergics, anticholinesterases, local anesthetics, and sympathomimetics may be used in children with MH. Parents and the child should be educated on the different aspects of this rare complex medical condition known as MH.</p><p class="Para" id="Par41">For our patient, her parents should go through <span id="ITerm70">genetic testing</span> to identify which side of the family might have mutation related to MH. It is possible for genetic testing to be negative or <span id="ITerm71">inconclusive; </span>and if it is feasible, an in vitro contracture test should be performed next. Our patient should be identified as MH susceptible for any future surgeries or anesthetics. A medical alert bracelet can be helpful to wear in case of emergencies. Any future anesthetics for her should strictly avoid inhalational agents and succinylcholine.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec9"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">9 </span>If This Was Not MH, Could This Be Aspiration of Secretion/Blood During Intubation/Extubation?</h2><p class="Para" id="Par42">The fever could <span id="ITerm72">be</span> a result of aspiration event leading to pneumonia or pneumonitis causing the fever in the immediate postoperative period. <span id="ITerm73">General anesthesia</span> can leave patients susceptible to aspiration if they vomit during induction of anesthesia. Our nil per os (NPO) “nothing by mouth” guidelines help in minimizing this risk. NPO adherence takes careful preoperative instruction and communication with families. Many families are often worried about not allowing children access to nutrition and water for long periods of time. In some families, food is used as a motivation for good behavior. But the NPO guidelines help to alleviate much of the risk of aspiration. Careful clear communication with families is vital.</p><p class="Para" id="Par43">Other issues with our patient are the blood encountered during nasal intubation. This patient likely had <span id="ITerm74">adenoid hypertrophy</span>. Studies have shown the incidence of adenoid hypertrophy for children and adolescence to be about 34%. Some studies report incidences up to 70% [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR14" role="doc-biblioref">14</a></span>]. Typically, many anesthesiologists try to decrease the bleeding during a nasal intubation with the use of vasoconstrictors. <span id="ITerm75">Oxymetazoline</span> 0.05% is the most used vasoconstrictor. But other vasoconstrictors, like cocaine or epinephrine, have been also described to be effective in decreasing bleeding [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR15" role="doc-biblioref">15</a></span>]. Other techniques to decrease nasal intubation bleeding are use of gels to lubricate the nasal RAE tube, warming the intubation tube in warm saline to soften the tube, dilating the nares with nasal trumpets, and using a red-rubber catheter as a guide on the end of the nasal RAE tube to spread the adenoids as the tube passes the adenoids [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR16" role="doc-biblioref">16</a></span>]. All these can decrease the amount of bleeding from the adenoids during nasal intubation.</p><p class="Para" id="Par44">In our patient, blood <span id="ITerm76">might </span>have entered the trachea during the nasal intubation attempt. It is prudent to attempt to suction secretions and particularly blood out of the tracheal tree. Clotted blood can lead to severe obstruction and respiratory compromise. Removal of the blood with a saline lavage will greatly reduce this risk.</p><p class="Para" id="Par45">Since she was coughing in the recovery room, the question of aspiration was part of our differential diagnosis. If MH was not high on the differential diagnosis, it may be warranted to do a laboratory investigation looking for a leukocytosis and a chest film to look for an infiltration. The steady dramatic rise of body temperature immediately after surgery is uncommon after an aspiration event.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec10"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">10 </span>Could This Be Starting a Viral Illness in the Family? Should the Case Have Been Started Given the Child Had a Resolved <span id="ITerm77">Upper Respiratory Illness (URI)</span> and a Sick Contact at Home?</h2><p class="Para" id="Par46">In our patient, the onset of an URI in a child with known reactive airway should not be undertaken without careful assessment of risks and benefits. Most elective cases such as <span id="ITerm78">dental rehabilitation</span> should be postponed especially if an intubation is necessary to accomplish the surgery. Research has shown that URI was associated with a higher risk of perioperative respiratory adverse reactions if the URI was less than 2 weeks before the procedure and if URI symptoms were present at the time of procedure [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">17</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par47">Another review of several studies with focus on the safety of anesthesia in children with URI undergoing general anesthesia provided a proposal for a decision algorithm. The summary of the review of these pediatric studies concluded with safety guidelines that <span id="ITerm79">general anesthesia</span> should be postponed for at least 2 weeks in children with symptomatic infections with fever, wheezing, and purulent secretions. This review also recommended anesthetic options for children with upper respiratory infection with a runny nose and cough to include <span id="ITerm80">preoperative inhalational therapy</span> with albuterol, use of a face mask or laryngeal mask, intravenous induction with propofol and avoidance of desflurane, and endotracheal intubation whenever possible [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR18" role="doc-biblioref">18</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par48">One of the most debated and discussed topics in <span id="ITerm81">pediatric anesthesia</span> is the dilemma of a child with upper respiratory illness which started the evening before or the morning of surgery or whether to proceed with anesthesia/surgery or to postpone until the patient is without symptoms. It has been written and debated in many journal articles with pros and cons. Considering many children have six to eight URI per year on average [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR19" role="doc-biblioref">19</a></span>], finding a window to schedule surgery may deprive the child of necessary surgical intervention and care. URIs increase the possibility of a perioperative respiratory event; but anesthesiologists are in better position to mitigate some of some those risks and manage some of the complications without associated morbidity [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR18" role="doc-biblioref">18</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par49"><span id="ITerm82">Upper respiratory tract infections</span> are usually virally mediated with rhinovirus making up 30–40% of those illnesses [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR19" role="doc-biblioref">19</a></span>]. URIs are usually self-limiting but must be distinguished from more serious infections like pneumonia, bronchiolitis, croup, or streptococcal throat. Hyperactivity of the airways with URI is very common and can persist up to 6 weeks after the infection. The hyperactivity can lead to laryngospasm and bronchospasm which can complicate the anesthetic management.</p><p class="Para" id="Par50">The preoperative assessment of patients with URI needs to focus on symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath, energy level/lethargy, appetite, color of secretion, cough, sputum production, and wheezing. These symptoms can provide insight on the degree of disease and if the child is more at risk of respiratory sequelae after anesthesia. Children with mild symptoms often do well with anesthesia and surgery.</p><p class="Para" id="Par51">The risks and benefits of anesthesia and surgery must be carefully weighed in patients with URI. On occasion cancelation of surgery can lead to worsening of the disease process if surgery is postponed for the typical 4 weeks or resolution of URI. If the case is urgent, the anesthetic plan must be tailored to attempt to decrease the respiratory complication associated with URI, like suctioning of airway, use of <span id="ITerm83">laryngeal mask airway (LMA)</span> for instrumenting the airway if appropriate, use of anticholinergics, or humidification.</p><p class="Para" id="Par52">Our patient had URI symptoms 4 weeks before and was currently asymptomatic even though she was exposed to a sick sibling at home. She was symptom-free for surgery, and it was the ideal time to have her anesthetic and surgery.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec11"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">11 </span>Is MH the Diagnosis for Rising Temperature in PACU?</h2><p class="Para" id="Par53">She had the <span id="ITerm84">typical </span>clinical presentation of malignant hyperthermia of developing dramatic increase in temperature after reaching PACU with persistent tachycardia, hyperventilation, and rigidity suggestive of an ongoing hypermetabolic syndrome. Intravenous administration of succinylcholine can result in masseter muscle contraction which can cause difficulty in opening the jaws for reintubation—a problem that was not seen in her. There was a definite triggering agent administered intramuscularly because of the lack of a functioning intravenous line. This choice of this route for drug administration was necessary and clinically significant since the IM dose of succinylcholine (mg/kg) administered is always much higher than if it was administered intravenously to treat laryngospasm. Hyperthermia is considered as a dramatic but frequently a late sign of MH, but the steady rate of increase can be as rapid as 1–2 ° every 5<span id="ITerm85"> min</span>. If there is a delay in treating this rising temperature, it can lead hypercarbia, increase in oxygen consumption DIC, and multiple organ failure. Vigilant monitoring of temperature and aggressive measures to cool the patient down must be instituted as the treatment with <span id="ITerm86">dantrolene</span> and other treatment modalities to correct the combined respiratory and metabolic acidosis [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par54">Although we didn’t have a quantitative measure of her CO<sub>2</sub>, in PACU on arrival, she was tachypneic and trying to compensate for her metabolic acidosis. She had a steady rise in temperature in a short period of time after arrival which made the anesthesiologist suspect that MH was the possible diagnosis for this hyperthermia. It was evident that she was developing uncontrolled muscle contractures and limb rigidity as the second intravenous line was placed.</p><p class="Para" id="Par55">From her preoperative history, she had been exposed to triggering agents in the past. Her family history regarding MH was vague despite the history of a relative dying during emergency surgery under anesthesia. She was treated immediately with dantrolene 2.5 mg/kg every 5 min until her tachycardia decreased; her hyperthymia ceased to rise; and her rigidity became less. This required two doses of dantrolene. On her blood gas, pH is 7.15, PCO<sub>2</sub> 55, pO<sub>2</sub> 70, Na 135, K 5.3, and BE −10. She had both a metabolic and respiratory acidosis which were treated with sodium bicarbonate. After the second IV <span id="ITerm87">was </span>placed, an arterial line and foley catheter were placed. She was treated with active cooling techniques which included surface ice packs and forced cool air. She fortunately did not have hyperkalemia. Her urine was sent for analysis for myoglobin and color was noted to be the classical cola urine appearance pointing to myoglobinuria which was later confirmed by the lab to be positive and significantly high. She was admitted to the intensive care unit for monitoring for 24 h. Her CPK rise was also significant reaching as high as 36,000 I.U. almost 8 h after the episode. She didn’t have recrudescence during her stay in the hospital. She was discharged after 2 days with normal blood gases, electrolytes, and coagulation values. Her vital signs stabilized within 12 h, and she was afebrile and well hydrated with adequate urine output.</p><p class="Para" id="Par56"><span id="ITerm88">Education</span> was given to both parents about the episode of MH with the help of an interpreter. The plan was for her family to have genetic testing soon. Depending on family genetic testing, a muscle biopsy may be warranted for her parents. Our patient will always be identified as malignant hyperthermia susceptible for the rest of her life and will benefit from having a medical alert bracelet to identify her as MH susceptible. An anesthesia alert about her MH susceptibility should be entered into her electronic data systems so that she will never be exposed to triggering agents. If she undergoes an anesthetic for future surgery, TIVA with propofol and <span id="ITerm89">opioids </span>may be a choice with regional blocks with local anesthetics and nontriggering agents like nondepolarizing muscle relaxants if necessary to supplement the anesthetic. Prophylactic pretreatment with <span id="ITerm90">dantrolene</span> is still controversial although its availability must be confirmed before the surgery starts.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec12"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">12 </span>Summary</h2><p class="Para" id="Par57">It is fortunately rare to encounter MH in our daily clinical practice. However, it is vital for the anesthesiologists and perioperative caregivers to be aware of the development of MH, and so temperature monitoring should be undertaken in cases lasting longer than 30 min. MH is a hypermetabolic syndrome that can rapidly result in fatality if there is delay in diagnosis and treatment. When a child with occult MH susceptibility is exposed to triggering agents and develops signs persistent tachycardia, hyperventilation, hyperthermia, and muscle rigidity, aggressive measures should be taken to continuously monitor, treat, and reevaluate the ongoing hypermetabolic state with team effort to continue the treatment ultimately in an intensive care setting. A dramatic increase in temperature in the PACU should be investigated thoroughly to rule out onset of MH even if there are other differential diagnoses that could possibly be the etiology of a postoperative fever as in the patient described. The four “red herrings” or “false clues” for the postoperative fever in this patient are worth noting: a dental procedure where (1) the whole body is covered for the entire duration of surgery, (2) dental procedures with extraction of infected teeth after nasotracheal intubation causing bacteremia, (3) an ongoing viral infection, and (4) episode of aspiration of blood from the nose on anesthetic induction. Vigilance in monitoring and prompt treatment is vital in preventing morbidity and for improving safety in these children.</p></section>
