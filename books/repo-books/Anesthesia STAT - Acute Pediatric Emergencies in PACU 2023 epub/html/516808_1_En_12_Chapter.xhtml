Significant medical history includes: 22q.11 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge syndrome), postsurgical complete heart block with pacemaker, seasonal allergies, and hypothyroidism. Details of the patient’s congenital heart defect are described as: double outlet right ventricle, ventricular septal defect, and interrupted aortic arch type B which was repaired in infancy at an international hospital outside. This repair involved combining the aorta and pulmonary artery into a new aorta and then using a graft to form a new connection between the right ventricle and the pulmonary arteries. Prior to this routine cardiac catheterization, the patient reported no symptoms, and the procedure was elective.</p><p class="Para" id="Par3">The family lives a far distance from the hospital and has limited English proficiency. The preoperative evaluation was conducted with video-enhanced language interpretive services (an example of this is the MARTTI or My Accessible Real-Time Trusted Interpreter <span id="ITerm2">system</span>). The patient states he was told in the past that there was something wrong with his thyroid, but he currently takes no medications, and has no drug allergies. He lives with his grandmother, and she reports that he is sedentary, mainly playing video games several hours per day.</p><p class="Para" id="Par4">The patient underwent general endotracheal anesthesia after an intravenous induction with etomidate 0.2 mg/kg and rocuronium and for his cardiac catheterization. The volatile agent used for maintenance of anesthesia was isoflurane. He was easily extubated deep after reversal of muscle relaxant at the end of the catheterization and transferred to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) in the supine position. The patient received midazolam 2 mg, fentanyl 25 mcg, and approximately 1 mcg/kg of dexmedetomidine. For <span id="ITerm3">prevention</span> of postoperative nausea and vomiting, the patient received ondansetron intravenously. Shortly after arriving to the PACU, the patient began obstructing his airway, and his oxygen saturation showed an abrupt drop to the low 50s on pulse oximetry. An oral airway was immediately placed, and his breathing was assisted with 100% oxygen via bag mask ventilation to provide positive end expiratory pressure. Post-catheterization patients are required to remain supine for 4–6 hours to decrease risk of bleeding from vascular access sites in the groin since heparin is routinely given, but not reversed with protamine. This supine positioning worsened his airway obstruction. Therefore, bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) was started until the patient was sufficiently awake to maintain his airway without support.</p><p class="Para" id="Par5">Upon questioning his grandmother further, she reported a history of loud nighttime snoring, periods of apnea, and daytime sleepiness. She also reported that he jerks his arms and legs sporadically while sleeping. Since she considered these movements were related to nightmares, she had not taken him to a doctor.</p><p class="Para" id="Par6">The patient was closely observed in postanesthesia care unit overnight and an endocrine consultation was made for follow-up. His pediatrician was notified of the events, and a sleep study was ordered which confirmed the diagnosis of severe obstructive sleep apnea and periodic limb movement disorder. The endocrine assessment showed that he had moderate hypothyroidism and started him on levothyroxine.</p><div class="Para" id="Par7">In reviewing this patient’s acute respiratory <span id="ITerm4">depression</span> after general anesthesia combined with his undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea and occult hypothyroidism, the following questions need answers to elucidate how this problem could have been averted:<div class="OrderedList"><ol><li class="ListItem"><div class="ItemNumber">1.</div><div class="ItemContent"><p class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild" id="Par8"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Were the language barrier and absence of a thorough preoperative history contributory to this outcome?</em></p></div><div class="ClearBoth"> </div></li><li class="ListItem"><div class="ItemNumber">2.</div><div class="ItemContent"><p class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild" id="Par9"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Was there a need for the patient to be assessed preoperatively by a dedicated preoperative screening clinic because of his comorbidities?</em></p></div><div class="ClearBoth"> </div></li><li class="ListItem"><div class="ItemNumber">3.</div><div class="ItemContent"><p class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild" id="Par10"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Was the lack of complete assessment of this young obese man with congenital cardiac disease with occult OSA and hypothyroidism the reason for his respiratory failure in PACU?</em></p></div><div class="ClearBoth"> </div></li><li class="ListItem"><div class="ItemNumber">4.</div><div class="ItemContent"><p class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild" id="Par11"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Could management of his postoperative course have been improved by obtaining expert consultation by the sleep medicine physicians regarding his OSA or by completing some preoperative labs to evaluate the status of his thyroid function by an endocrinologist?</em></p></div><div class="ClearBoth"> </div></li><li class="ListItem"><div class="ItemNumber">5.</div><div class="ItemContent"><p class="Para" id="Par12"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Should this case have been postponed to a later date if the anesthesiologist felt that the patient was not properly screened or optimally prepared for a general anesthesia for cardiac catheterization followed by supine position?</em><span id="ITerm5"/></p></div><div class="ClearBoth"> </div></li></ol></div></div></section>

It is characterized by periods of periodic cessation of air exchange (apnea), with apneic episodes lasting longer than 10 s. These episodes occur more frequently during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and increase in frequency as more time is spent in REM sleep periods as the night progresses [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>]. Once thought to only be an isolated disorder of pharyngeal muscle mechanical dysfunction leading to intermittent airway obstruction, we know now that it is more complicated [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par15">Because of the multisystem implications, it can also be referred to as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) since it involves the central nervous, cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune systems [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></span>]. Sleep apnea may be <span id="ITerm6">defined</span> as central (absent gas flow, lack of respiratory effort), obstructive (absent gas flow, upper airway obstruction, and paradoxical movement of rib cage and abdominal muscles), or mixed (due to both CNS defect and obstructive problems) [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par16">The estimated prevalence of <span id="ITerm7">OSA</span> is between 1 and 5% making it a common childhood disorder [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></span>]. OSA occurs in children of all ages (about 1.2% of all children) but is more common in children 3–7 years of age. In a large study looking at over 5000 children, Bixler et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></span>] found the prevalence of AHI ≥ 5 was 1.2% in a representative sample of elementary school children. Risk factors for sleep-disordered breathing <span id="ITerm8">(SDB)</span> included waist circumference and nasal abnormalities (e.g., chronic sinusitis/rhinitis). Black or Latino heritage was also a risk factor for OSA, and this could be attributed to recent studies that show that predominately Black and Latino neighborhoods have increased air pollution. A 2019 study published in the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Annals of the American Thoracic Society</em> showed a relationship between chronic air pollution exposure and sleep apnea [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></span>]. Since air pollution exposures differ geographically, for example, in the United States due to racial and ethnicity discrimination in housing which lead to geographic segregation of people, this may partially explain difference in lung and sleep health by demographics such as socio-economic status, race and ethnicity [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></span>]. The strong linear relationship between waist circumference and BMI across all degrees of severity of SDB suggests that, as in adults, metabolic factors may be among the most important risk factors for SDB in children [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></span>].</p></section>

<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec9"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2.7 </span>Does Hypothyroidism Contribute to Worsening of OSA?</h3><p class="Para" id="Par27">There is a complex relationship between body mass index (BMI), thyroid function, and its effects on OSA—raising the question “should all patients with suspected OSA should be screened?”. Some studies have described an association between thyroid disorders and OSA. Whether this is a direct effect of thyroid disorders or it is indirectly related to BMI values is an important point to ponder. A recent study by Sharma et al. evaluated the prevalence of thyroid disorders in relation to BMI in newly diagnosed patients with OSA confirmed by polysomnography. This study found that the prevalence of hypothyroidism was common among patients with OSA and the severity of OSA correlated with thyroid function tests and BMI [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par28"><span id="ITerm20">Hypothyroidism</span><span id="ITerm21"/> can also contribute to OSA because of its impact on metabolic syndrome. In a 2018 study, Bruyneel et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></span>] showed that TSH levels did not correlate to AHI, but they did to BMI. Thyroid function parameters were associated with BMI but not with the severity of OSA. The one factor that is consistently a strong risk factor for OSA is obesity. There is a two-pronged association between thyroid dysfunction and obesity. The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction is higher in obese people, and patients with overt hypothyroidism (OH) are more prone to gain weight compared to euthyroid patients. Therefore, there is a natural link between hypothyroidism, obesity, and OSA.</p><p class="Para" id="Par29">Nocturnal breathing abnormalities, such as snoring, choking, and, in severe cases, apnea/hypopnea events, occur in 25–35% of patients with hypothyroidism [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">12</a></span>]. The effects of <span id="ITerm22">hypothyroidism</span> treatment on OSA have been mixed [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR12" role="doc-biblioref">13</a></span>]. Although many studies support the hypothesis that OSA is associated with thyroid dysfunction, the level of thyroid dysfunction does not appear to predict OSA severity, and the severity of the OSA may have subtle effects on the thyroid hormone levels [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR12" role="doc-biblioref">13</a></span>]. The indirect effects of hypothyroidism such as increased weight gain and metabolic syndrome can increase risk of developing OSA.</p><p class="Para" id="Par30">A meta-analysis of patients with euthyroid and hypothyroid <span id="ITerm23">status</span> and OSA showed that AHI, duration oxygen desaturation &lt;90%, and Epworth sleepiness scale (scale for daytime sleepiness) were higher in patients with OSA and hypothyroidism.

If possible, patients at increased perioperative risk from OSA should be placed in a non-supine position throughout the recovery process.</p><p class="Para" id="Par35">Hospitalized <span id="ITerm27">patients</span> who are at increased risk of respiratory compromise from OSA should have continuous pulse oximetry monitoring after discharge from the recovery room. If frequent or severe airway obstruction or hypoxemia occurs during postoperative monitoring, initiation of nasal CPAP or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation should be considered.</p><p class="Para" id="Par36">Patients at increased perioperative risk from OSA should not be discharged from the recovery area to an unmonitored setting (i.e., home or unmonitored hospital bed) until they are no longer at risk of postoperative respiratory depression. Because of their propensity to develop airway obstruction or central respiratory depression, this may require a longer stay as compared with non-OSA patients undergoing similar <span id="ITerm28">procedures</span>. To establish that patients can maintain adequate oxygen saturation levels while breathing room air, respiratory function may be determined by observing patients in an unstimulated environment, preferably while asleep. The preferred patient positioning is lateral and prone, with the least preferred positioning being the supine position.</p></section>

Their conclusion was that dexmedetomidine must be used with caution in patients with bradycardia or atrioventricular block [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR15" role="doc-biblioref">16</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR16" role="doc-biblioref">17</a></span>]. Although <span id="ITerm30">dexmedetomidine</span> can be safely used to decrease narcotics given, it can still produce bradycardia in patients and must be used with caution. In this case the patient has a pacemaker, and assuming it is functioning well, this would not be a contraindication to using dexmedetomidine.</p><p class="Para" id="Par39">Whenever a patient with a pacemaker is presenting for surgery, the pacemaker should be interrogated by electrophysiologists. Ideally there should be a report completed within 6 months from the date of surgery or procedure to ensure it is functional and has adequate battery life.</p></section>

If the patient will not tolerate placement of an oral or nasal airway device, utilize a strap which interlocks to the mask to make a seal around the nose and mouth, and connect it to a Jackson-Rees. You can also connect it to a ventilator machine that has a CPAP setting. This will not be as comfortable as a custom-fit <span id="ITerm32">CPAP</span> device but can work to facilitate ventilation.</p><p class="Para" id="Par42">In this case of a cardiac catheterization, you can incline the bed in reverse Trendelenburg to maintain the patient supine. If the case does not require the patient to lay supine in the bed, elevating the head of the bed 30° can help decrease obstruction. You can also try to place a shoulder roll under the patient. Alternative positioning such as placing the patient in a lateral decubitus position can help alleviate airway obstruction.</p><p class="Para" id="Par43">A recent article published as a front page in the journal <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Anesthesiology</em> discussed the use of alternative methods when <span id="ITerm33">CPAP</span> is not available. They found that elevating the head of the bed 30 degrees and using high-flow nasal cannula at 20 L/min helped decrease AHI [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR18" role="doc-biblioref">19</a></span>].</p></section>

In adult patients with OSA, high serum levels of erythropoietin have been associated with higher AHI.

<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec16"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2.14 </span>What Is the Etiology for Impaired Respiratory Function in Obese Patients Under Anesthesia?</h3><p class="Para" id="Par45">Functional residual <span id="ITerm35">capacity</span><span id="ITerm36"/> in normal patients decreases by 20% under general anesthesia in the supine position. When a normal healthy patient assumes supine position and anesthesia is induced, there is a change in the configuration of the thoracic and abdominal cavity which can decrease efficient oxygenation due to atelectasis, airway closure, and increased ventilation/perfusion mismatching in the dependent zones of the lung. Increasing tidal volume and vital capacity breaths can help re-expand atelectatic areas in the lung.</p><p class="Para" id="Par46">In obese patients, reduction of <span id="ITerm37">FRC</span><span id="ITerm38"/> is much greater due to the loss of inspiratory muscle tone of the muscles acting on the rib cage and from gas trapping when anesthetized.</p><p class="Para" id="Par47">Obesity alters the mechanical properties of both chest wall and lungs because of excess fat deposition in the abdominal and thoracic cavities. The net effect of these results in poor compliance of the lungs causing alteration in the pattern of breathing. The reduction in diaphragmatic movement downward due to intra-abdominal fat results in compression atelectasis of the lung bases and reduction in expiratory reserve volume and functional residual capacity. Distribution of ventilation in obese patients is toward the upper lobes which have lesser perfusion, thus increasing ventilation perfusion mismatch and existing intrapulmonary shunting. The reduction of <span id="ITerm39">FRC</span><span id="ITerm40"/> is directly proportional to the severity of obesity. Airway closure in obese patients can occur at normal resting breathing because of reduction of FRC to levels at or even below closing capacity.</p><p class="Para" id="Par48">General anesthesia worsens lung atelectasis in morbidly obese patients for 24 h after surgery compared to non-obese patients. Application of CPAP will improve postoperative pulmonary function in these patients at risk for persistent atelectasis. Another strategy that reportedly can improve ventilation is placing them in reverse Trendelenburg position [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR20" role="doc-biblioref">21</a></span>].</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec17"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">3 </span>Summary</h2><p class="Para" id="Par49">Obesity is a significant risk factor in children and a modifier of disease conditions like asthma, OSA, and pulmonary hypertension. In obese teenagers, a thorough preoperative evaluation of their cardiac and pulmonary function and comorbid conditions (OSA, hypertension, hypothyroidism, metabolic syndrome) should be obtained prior to scheduling the patient for elective surgery. During anesthesia, careful titration of drugs that can affect respiratory drive and vigilant intraoperative and postoperative monitoring of oxygenation are important. Applying CPAP or BIPAP to improve oxygenation and ventilation in patients with OSA and continuously monitoring the adequacy of ventilation can help optimize their perioperative stability and safety.</p><p class="Para" id="Par50">In patients who need to be supine after a catheterization procedure, a reverse Trendelenburg position in the postoperative period may be helpful to improve ventilation. Waist circumference and not BMI should be used to estimate the impairment of lung function in obese patients because it is considered as a marker of metabolic disease from obesity. Ideally this patient should have been seen in a preoperative clinic to facilitate time to discuss his complex medical history with appropriate interpreter services, to gather records from previous surgeries, and to investigate his snoring and excess somnolence as well as his thyroid function. Preoperative knowledge that this obese patient was hypothyroid with significant OSA would have enabled the anesthesiologist to choose a technique to avoid postoperative respiratory complications. It is important for the anesthesiologist to have a team discussion with the operative service to delay the case if the patient is not optimized preoperatively—preparing for success can prevent adverse events.</p></section>
