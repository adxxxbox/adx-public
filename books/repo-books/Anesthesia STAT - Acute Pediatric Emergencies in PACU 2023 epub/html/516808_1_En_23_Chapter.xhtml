Medical history included class 3 obesity, severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), mild asthma, pre-hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><p class="Para" id="Par3">Past <span id="ITerm1">surgical history </span>was significant for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy at age 6. The patient last had clear liquid at 10 pm the previous night.</p><p class="Para" id="Par4">Current <span id="ITerm2">medications </span>included daily omeprazole, oral contraceptive pills (Loestrin), and albuterol prn. She mentioned that in addition she uses a CPAP machine at night. Previous anesthetic history was unremarkable, and the patient has no known drug allergies.</p><p class="Para" id="Par5"><span id="ITerm3">Physical examination </span>of the patient revealed a wide neck circumference, Mallampati 3, but reassuring thyromental distance. In addition, she has large breasts and an obese abdomen. The respiratory exam showed distant breath sounds bilaterally, and her cardiac exam on auscultation revealed regular heart rate and rhythm. Additionally, the patient described that she did not walk much because of shortness of breath with activity and that she has been having difficulty lying flat. She regularly uses two pillows to prop her up at night when she goes to sleep. Preoperative ECG and ECHO were normal.</p><p class="Para" id="Par6">Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 136/88 mmHg; heart rate, 80 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 25 breaths per minute; and spO<sub>2</sub>, 96% on room air.</p><p class="Para" id="Par7">The patient agreed to a preoperative placement of IV although she was mildly anxious. With the use of a S-Caine <span id="ITerm4">patch™</span> to numb the skin, an intravenous catheter was placed on the dorsum of her hand as she was able to be kept calm through <span id="ITerm5">verbal reassurance</span> [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>]. She was brought to the operating room and positioned with a few blankets to prop her up. She was also placed in a slight reverse Trendelenburg position to assist with lung mechanics and to minimize passive regurgitation.</p><div class="Para" id="Par8">After monitors were placed, she was preoxygenated with 100% oxygen for about 4–5 min and anesthetic induction proceeded with 40 mg of intravenous lidocaine, 150 mg of propofol, and 25 μg of fentanyl. After the patient became apneic, an oral airway was placed, and patient was masked with 100% oxygen prior to the administration of succinylcholine. <span id="ITerm6">Intubation</span> was accomplished with use of a CMAC, and endotracheal tube placement was confirmed with end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO<sub>2</sub>) and bilateral auscultation of equal breath sounds. After inflating the cuff, the endotracheal tube was taped carefully with Tegaderm on either side of the mouth, and a temperature probe was placed in the mouth. The patient was paralyzed with rocuronium 50 mg after she showed clinical evidence of having recovered from succinylcholine and placed on pressure-controlled ventilation. A test dose of cefazolin of 50 mg was administered followed by the maximum recommended dose of cefazolin of 2 Gms prior to the surgical prep and clean for the planned laparoscopic gastric sleeve surgery (Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">1</a></span>).<figure class="Figure" id="Fig1"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO1"><img alt="" aria-describedby="d64e259" src="../images/516808_1_En_23_Chapter/516808_1_En_23_Fig1_HTML.jpg" style="width:23.12em"/><div class="TextObject" id="d64e259"><p class="Para" id="Par98">A photograph of 4 laparoscopes connected to the 4 laparoscopic trocars, which are inserted inside the 4 laparoscopic ports of a patient's abdomen.</p></div></div><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Fig. 1</span><p class="SimplePara">Surgical setup for gastric sleeve surgery via laparoscopic approach.

This desaturation resolved after the ET tube that was inadvertently pushed in further into the trachea was pulled back to its original position. Placement of dilatational rubber bougies of increasing sizes often requested by the surgical team also can also cause the ET tube to move deeper into the trachea and cause sudden oxygen desaturation. The placement of temperature probe, orogastric tube, and dilatational rubber bougies can often push the tube tip into right main bronchus because of the patient’s short neck and steep Trendelenburg position.</p><div class="Para" id="Par10">During the case, the patient again developed <span id="ITerm8">hypercarbia</span> and decreased tidal volume after table position was changed to a sideway tilt combined with steep Trendelenburg position and when the insufflation of CO<sub>2</sub> commenced. After auscultation and determination that the tube tip was in the appropriate position above the carina, the inspired pressure was adjusted to improve the tidal volume to a volume of approximately 12–15 mL/kg and respiratory rate adjusted to reduce the ETCO<sub>2</sub>. Maintenance anesthetic was accomplished with <span id="ITerm9">sevoflurane</span> and <span id="ITerm10">pain management</span> with multimodal analgesia: fentanyl 0.2 mcg/kg, iv acetaminophen, and iv ketorolac (Toradol) after the surgery was over and surgeon was satisfied with overall hemostasis (Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2">2</a></span>). <figure class="Figure" id="Fig2"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO2"><img alt="" aria-describedby="d64e304" src="../images/516808_1_En_23_Chapter/516808_1_En_23_Fig2_HTML.jpg" style="width:23.12em"/><div class="TextObject" id="d64e304"><p class="Para" id="Par99">A laparoscopic photograph of the stomach post vertical sleeve gastrectomy surgery with visible blood vessels.</p></div></div><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Fig. 2</span><p class="SimplePara">Laparoscopic view after sleeve operation.

The need for awake extubation was discussed with patient and her parents during the preop interview that she might remember the presence of an endotracheal tube in her mouth for a brief period and that she may experience a mild sore throat which will be treated with blow by oxygen mist and if needed a nebulizing treatment of racemic epinephrine will be administered in PACU. The oropharynx was carefully suctioned, and a soft bite block was placed. During emergence, the patient had several episodes of coughing with increased peak airway pressures. The ETT was also suctioned with only minimal secretions. During this episode, the patient desaturated to 89%; auscultation revealed mildly coarse breath sounds that resolved with administration of albuterol. The patient was then successfully extubated in the semi-upright position after being fully awake. The patient was transferred to the hospital bed, and an attempt was made to have the head of the bed elevated and a few blankets rolled to form a firm shoulder roll prop which was placed behind the patient to help facilitate effective respirations. During transport to the post-anesthesia care unit, the patient was noted to have developed an obstructive pattern of breathing that was relieved by the chin lift and jaw thrust maneuver. Application of 100% oxygen by face mask connected to a Jackson-Rees <span id="ITerm14">circuit</span> that was attached to a portable oxygen tank allowed the continuous assessment of adequate respiratory rate and volume.</p><p class="Para" id="Par14">On arrival to the PACU, the patient although breathing spontaneously was noted to slowly develop heavy snoring and somewhat difficult to arouse. The oxygen saturation was 96% even when continuing 100% oxygen by face mask. The patient was also repositioned to try and relieve her <span id="ITerm15">upper airway obstruction</span>. An attempt was also made to place an oral airway; however, the patient was too awake for its placement. During the handoff process, the anesthesiologist emphasized to the PACU nurse the need to maintain the patient in an almost upright sitting position and about her sensitivity to narcotics and to place the patient on her home CPAP machine once it had been evaluated by the hospital biomed. Her vital signs were stable, and she appeared more responsive when the handoff was eventually over.</p><p class="Para" id="Par15">Approximately 25 min after the patient was dropped off at the PACU, anesthesia was called stat to the bedside for sudden onset of oxygen desaturation. On arrival, the patient was noted to be lying flat with the center of the bed sunken resulting in flexion of the patient’s neck. The patient was also noted have any spontaneous respiratory effort, and no noticeable chest rise was seen, and chest auscultation revealed no breath sounds. The oxygen saturations were noted to be in the 70s. The patient was also difficult to arouse, and the patient was still not wearing the CPAP machine. As soon as the head was extended and firm jaw thrust was applied simultaneously by the anesthesiologist, it was followed by placement of an <span id="ITerm16">oral airway and controlled ventilation</span> with 100% oxygen by face mask. There was a steady improvement of oxygen saturation, and after about 5 min, she was awake and maintained in a semi-sitting position with pillows and head of bed elevation. Her <span id="ITerm17">CPAP machine</span> was placed without difficulty when she tolerated this well. For the rest of her stay in PACU, she was advised to remain in a semi-sitting state with supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula with the side port attached to the monitor to measure CO<sub>2</sub> in each breath. She had one to one nursing care and the orders to receive Tylenol and Motrin round the clock. She spent the rest of the day playing cards with her parents and sister and watching some movies on TV. Her saturation on room air was back to preoperative levels and she was instructed to take deep breaths and cough frequently and helped by the nurse to ambulate around the PACU corridors. She was discharged home the next day without any further problems with oxygen desaturation.</p><section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec1"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">1 </span>What Are the Differential Diagnoses for Postoperative Desaturation After Bariatric Surgery?</h2><p class="Para" id="Par16">Patients who present <span id="ITerm18">for </span>bariatric surgery secondary to clinically significant obesity are at increased risk of respiratory complications. Some common causes of desaturation in the PACU includes upper airway obstruction, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), laryngospasm, hypoventilation secondary to residual anesthetics/analgesics causing respiratory depression and or inadequate airway maintenance (secondary to reduced muscle tone/residual neuromuscular blockade), obesity hypoventilation syndrome (chronic hypoventilation), and atelectasis. Additionally, poor positioning compounding reduced thoracic compliance, mucus plug/secretions, and bronchospasm which may result in hypoxemia [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>]. Pulmonary embolism should also be considered as a source of hypoxemia in this obese patient population postoperatively.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec2"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2 </span>How Does Respiratory Mechanics Differ in an Obese Patient?</h2><p class="Para" id="Par17">Obese patients have rapid <span id="ITerm19">desaturation</span> during the period of apnea during laryngoscopy, and this is mainly because of a decrease in functional residual capacity reduction in expiratory reserve and decreased ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratio [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par18">Prolonged pre-oxygenation in the “ramped-up” position is superior to the usual “sniff” position in morbidly obese patients to align oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal axes and must be meticulously accomplished prior to laryngoscopy and intubation [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par19">Video laryngoscopy should always be available and ready for use if there is a question about difficulty with direct laryngoscopy. Awake fiberoptic intubation is usually considered if the BMI is >50 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and/or a neck circumference is >42 cm.</p><p class="Para" id="Par20">After intubation, the tracheal tube position must be maintained at the correct depth, and ventilation must be optimized to maintain adequate oxygenation. Special ventilation techniques can improve oxygenation in morbidly obese patients undergoing anesthesia. Preoxygenation using a higher fraction of inspired oxygen with the patient at a 25 ° ramped-up position and rapid sequence intubation with succinyl choline to prevent air entry into the stomach with positive pressure ventilation by mask are suggested strategies in bariatric surgery. Laryngeal masks should be available as rescue devices and the difficult airway cart available in the OR.</p><p class="Para" id="Par21">Optimal ventilation strategies in obese patients include lung recruitment maneuvers up to 40 cm H<sub>2</sub>O for 30–40 s, use of higher tidal volumes (10–12 cc/kg) and PEEP (7–10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O), and complete muscle relaxation to maintain normocapnia [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par22">During bariatric surgery, the need for creating a pneumoperitoneum and increase in abdominal pressure can affect the patient’s respiratory mechanics [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR6" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></span>]. The addition of carbon dioxide for abdominal cavity inflation can cause increased intra-abdominal pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and decreased venous return which causes lowering of cardiac output. Pneumothorax, air embolism, and mediastinal emphysema are some of the fatal complications of pneumoperitoneum.</p><p class="Para" id="Par23">Extubation is usually accomplished when the patient is fully reversed, wide awake, and following verbal commands. The patient is maintained with a 30–45 ° elevation of the upper torso and moved to the hospital bed with the help of Hover device. Patient is transported to the PACU with oxygen blow by in the same head-up position with a portable pulse oximeter attached to the finger for continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation.</p><p class="Para" id="Par24">General anesthesia commonly results in a reduced functional residual capacity (FRC) in normal individuals and results in atelectasis [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></span>]. Being in the supine position also reduces the FRC by 20% secondary to compression atelectasis, and this is worsened in the obese patient. In the obese patient, the diaphragm is shifted upward, and the thorax becomes less compliant resulting in a restrictive ventilatory pattern and atelectasis [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></span>]. Overall, the FRC, vital capacity (VC), and total lung capacity (TLC) are reduced in the obese population although closing capacity stays the same [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">9</a></span>]. Any condition that worsens these volume relationships will result in potential small airway closure, V/Q mismatch, and hypoxemia. Because of this, patients must be <span id="ITerm20">monitored</span> carefully in the PACU to minimize episodes of significant desaturation [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></span>].</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec3"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">3 </span>What Is the Prevalence of OSA in the Bariatric Population and What Role Did This Patient’s OSA Play in Her Postoperative Desaturation?</h2><p class="Para" id="Par25"><span id="ITerm21">Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)</span><span id="ITerm22"/> is a disorder related to sleep and designated by prolonged or intermittent partial to complete upper airway obstruction during sleep. It affects 1.2–5.7% of children in the USA [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></span>]. OSA was reported to have a prevalence of 13–59% in adolescents with severe obesity [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></span>] and a prevalence of greater than 70% in a cohort of adults presenting for evaluation for bariatric surgery [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR12" role="doc-biblioref">12</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par26">This patient had a known history of OSA, and CPAP machine was not appropriately applied during the postoperative period and may have contributed to the significant hypoxemia experienced in the PACU. One study by Gallagher et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>] (2010) found multiple episodes of desaturation with a nadir of 75% despite use of CPAP. Additionally, desaturation was seen in 100% of the patients in the first 24 h despite diagnosis and treatment for at least 6 weeks preoperatively. Therefore, based on these findings, it is unclear if the use of the CPAP machine would have prevented the desaturation episode in the PACU.</p></section>

According to a study by Tran et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR13" role="doc-biblioref">13</a></span>] (2020), OHS is present in approximately two-thirds of patients being referred for bariatric surgery. They also determined that moderate to severe OSA was a significant predictor of OHS. Although it is possible that this patient may have had OHS contributing to her risk for respiratory complication, she was not formally evaluated for the syndrome and her daytime PaCO<sub>2</sub> was unknown.</p><p class="Para" id="Par28">Although, intuitively, hypoventilation may appear to be a significant contributor of postoperative desaturation, Gallagher et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>] (2010) found that it did not play a significant role in the cause of desaturation in their bariatric patient population. A study in adult patients with and without OSA who underwent laparoscopic bariatric surgery did not show a significant increase in the incidence of desaturations in patients with OSA [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR14" role="doc-biblioref">14</a></span>].</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec5"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">5 </span>What Role Does Opioid Administration Play in Postoperative Desaturation in Bariatric Patients and What Alternative Pain Management Strategy Could Have Been Employed in This Patient?</h2><p class="Para" id="Par29">It is well known that one of the <span id="ITerm25">most</span> feared side effects of opioid analgesics is respiratory depression. One potential cause of desaturation in the postoperative care unit in the obese population undergoing bariatric surgery is narcotic-induced decreased arousal. This decreased arousal was also seen with the use of PCA [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>]. The presence of OSA and OHS also worsens the respiratory depressant effects of systemically administered opioids [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR15" role="doc-biblioref">15</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par30">Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) recommends the implementation of opioid-sparing analgesia [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR16" role="doc-biblioref">16</a></span>] of which regional anesthesia is an important component [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">17</a></span>]. It has been established that multimodal opioid-sparing analgesia is effective at controlling pain while also decreasing the narcotic use after bariatric surgery [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR18" role="doc-biblioref">18</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par31">This patient was given a bolus of fentanyl postoperatively, and this most likely potentiated the decreased arousal resulting in increased obstruction and oxygen desaturation. The bariatric patient population benefits from multimodal analgesia that decreases the use of opioids. TAP blocks were employed in one study and was shown to be effective at improving pain management and decreasing the use of narcotics and essentially the respiratory depressant effects associated with narcotics use [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR19" role="doc-biblioref">19</a></span>]. In addition to regional techniques for pain management, this patient may have benefited from use of non-opioids such as scheduled anti-inflammatories, for instance, acetaminophen was found to have opioid-sparing effect in a retrospective analysis [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR20" role="doc-biblioref">20</a></span>]. Other infusions such as dexmedetomidine and ketamine that have opioid-sparing effects can also be considered. According to one study, preoperative administration of <span id="ITerm26">ketamine</span> has been shown to reduce opioid consumption in postoperative bariatric patients along with the pain scores [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">21</a></span>].</p></section>

The extent of postoperative atelectasis depends on several factors such as type of surgical procedure, type of anesthesia, baseline pulmonary function, and position during surgery [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR23" role="doc-biblioref">23</a></span>]. Obesity in bariatric patients increases the risk of postoperative atelectasis secondary to the reduced FRC [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR24" role="doc-biblioref">24</a></span>]. Atelectasis may cause a V/Q mismatch and result in decreased compliance of the lung [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR22" role="doc-biblioref">22</a></span>]. Atelectasis can increase morbidity and mortality. It was seen in one study to be the cause of 11% of postoperative respiratory failure and related death [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR25" role="doc-biblioref">25</a></span>]. Not surprisingly, a study by Baltieri et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR26" role="doc-biblioref">26</a></span>] (2016) found atelectasis to be 37% prevalent in the bariatric surgery patient population even after exclusion of medical problems like OSA. In addition to the worsening and prolongation of atelectasis, laparoscopic surgery compounds this problem secondary to the reduced lung compliance with the institution of pneumoperitoneum [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR27" role="doc-biblioref">27</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par34">Atelectasis is usually diagnosed after development of tachypnea and hypoxemia (from blood gas analysis) and is usually seen after discharge from the recovery area and can worsen and continue for up to 5 days [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR28" role="doc-biblioref">28</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par35">The presence of atelectasis can result in severe hypoxemia secondary to decreased compliance of the lung tissue, V/Q mismatch, poor gas exchange, and an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance.

Methods that can be implemented to reduce the risk after bariatric surgery includes lung recruitment maneuvers such as incentive spirometry, deep breathing exercise, coughing, CPAP and appropriate pain management with regional technique and patient-controlled analgesics over potent analgesics, early mobilization, and head-up position [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR30" role="doc-biblioref">30</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR31" role="doc-biblioref">31</a></span>].</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec10"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">10 </span>Could Residual Neuromuscular Blockade Be a Potential Cause of This Patient’s Postoperative Desaturation?</h2><p class="Para" id="Par40"><span id="ITerm33">She</span> was administered neuromuscular blockade during the intraoperative period. It is possible that the reversal was not fully adequate and may have resulted in upper airway obstruction secondary to the decreased tone of the oropharyngeal tissue. Even though intermediate acting neuromuscular blocker was used and reversed pharmacologically for complete reversal, the complete recovery of muscle strength may not be accomplished fully prior to tracheal extubation [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR37" role="doc-biblioref">37</a></span>]. Small degrees of residual neuromuscular blockade (TOF 0.7–0.9) can result in upper airway obstruction due to the decreased pharyngeal muscle tone; it also causes reduced hypoxic ventilatory response and airway reflexes and predisposes the patient to aspiration [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR38" role="doc-biblioref">38</a></span>–<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR40" role="doc-biblioref">40</a></span>]. Another study by Kumar et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR41" role="doc-biblioref">41</a></span>] (2012) reported that residual neuromuscular blockade can decrease the forced vital capacity and peak expiratory flow in the immediate postoperative period. Sugammadex was used for reversal in this patient. Sugammadex is a selective relaxant-binding agent specifically developed for rapid reversal of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium. Its potential clinical benefits include fast and predictable reversal of any degree of block, increased patient safety, and reduced incidence of residual block on recovery when compared to neostigmine [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR42" role="doc-biblioref">42</a></span>].
