His weight is 24 kg, and he looks small for his age. He has no history of prior anesthetics, he takes no medications and has no known drug allergies. General anesthesia is induced using an inhalational technique of 8% sevoflurane in 100% oxygen. A peripheral IV is placed and he is intubated with intravenous lidocaine, propofol, and rocuronium. A caudal block is attempted for postoperative pain relief but soon abandoned after two unsuccessful attempts resulting in a “bloody tap”. The patient is turned prone for optimal positioning for marrow harvesting. The procedure proceeds and finishes uneventfully, and when the patient is repositioned supine at the end of the case, a drop in SPO2 to the 70s is noted, while he was coughing and bucking on the tube as he emerged from anesthesia. Positive pressure ventilation became difficult, and bronchospasm is suspected. An IV bolus of propofol is used successfully and the patient is extubated to face mask and transferred to the PACU.</p><p class="Para" id="Par3">Twenty minutes following sign-out, the PACU anesthesiologist is called to the bedside because the patient is exhibiting severe agitation. After the patient is reoriented and calmed down, the source of the agitation is verbalized by him stating that he cannot see at all. Parents are near him and look alarmed because he is frantically touching objects and them saying repeatedly “I can’t see anything! Help me please, I think I am blind!”</p><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec2"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">1.1 </span>How Common Is Post-operative Visual Loss (POVL)?</h3><p class="Para" id="Par4">Postoperative visual loss (POVL) is a rare but devastating complication. In a literature review of perioperative visual loss after non-ocular surgeries, the author concluded that the <span id="ITerm1">incidence</span> was 0.002% of all surgeries and as high as 0.2% of cardiac and spine surgeries [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>], widely considered to be the “higher-risk” procedures for POVL [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR16" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>]. While any segment of the visual pathway can be implicated in POVL, the most common site for permanent injury is the optic nerves, mainly from ischemia.</p><p class="Para" id="Par5">While POVL is rare, other eye injuries do occur under general anesthesia with more <span id="ITerm2">prevalence</span>. In addition to vision loss, these injuries include direct trauma to the eye, keratopathy, or chemical injuries suffered while under general anesthesia.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec3"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">1.2 </span>Are There Specific Risk Factors That Make POVL More Likely?</h3><p class="Para" id="Par6">While it remains a rare complication, <span id="ITerm3"/>POVL has been shown to be associated with a variety of risk factors.</p><p class="Para" id="Par7"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Positioning</strong> <span id="ITerm4">complications</span> have been shown to increase the chance of POVL, with prone positioning leading to a higher risk of POVL [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR6" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></span>]. Ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) is equal to the difference between <span id="ITerm5">mean arterial pressure (MAP)</span> and intraocular pressure (IOP). Multiple studies have shown that in the prone position, IOP can rise dramatically leading to a lower ocular perfusion pressure, putting the patient’s vision at risk. Additionally, any positioning that results in any pressure on the face or eyes has been shown to increase the chance of POVL. Use of orthopedic and/or neurosurgical operating room tables that may lead to pressure on the eyes is particularly concerning, and patients should be positioned with extreme caution and care.</p><p class="Para" id="Par8">Traditionally, POVL was thought to be a complication specific to the very old and very sick, but newer research has shown that younger patients were among the highest-risk patients for POVL. <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Patient-specific</strong> <span id="ITerm6">factors</span> include male gender and age &lt; 18 years leading to a higher likelihood of POVL [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>]. Additionally, pathologic states during which oxygen delivery may be compromised, including hypotension and anemia, or the need for vasoconstrictive agents also increases the risk of visual complications.</p><p class="Para" id="Par9"><span id="ITerm7"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Procedure-specific risks</strong></span>: Studies have repeatedly shown that spinal and cardiac procedures have been most implicated in POVL [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></span>], especially in ischemic optic neuropathy and retinal vascular occlusion (see below). Some of the reasons for this include their long operative length and increased chance of hypotension and blood loss and transfusion, all states that can lead to hypoperfusion of the ocular structures.</p></section>

The donors are usually healthy, and after intubation they are <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">turned prone</strong> for the harvesting procedure.

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec6"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2 </span>Corneal Abrasions Describe the Presentation, Natural Course and Treatment of Corneal Abrasions</h2><p class="Para" id="Par16"><span id="ITerm11">Corneal abrasion </span><span id="ITerm12"/>is a complication well known to most anesthesiologists, as they are the most common perioperative ocular complication. Incidence has been shown to be as high as 0.013% to 0.17% of surgeries not involving the eye [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>]. Symptoms generally present in the 1–3 h following surgery and are described as a “foreign object sensation” in the eye [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR6" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par17">There are several reasons general anesthesia can predispose a patient to a corneal abrasion. These include physical contact with the globe during induction, maintenance, or emergence from anesthesia, especially inadvertently by a poorly fitting ventilation mask or from a patient scratching their eye upon awakening. Additionally, tear production that keeps the surface of the eye lubricated may be inhibited or depressed which can lead to a drier eye more susceptible to abrasion.</p><p class="Para" id="Par18">For this reason, prompt and correct taping of the eyelids as soon as the patient loses consciousness is important to lower the risk of corneal abrasions. Some anesthesiologists use ointment or eye drops to keep the eye moist, though no added benefit has been demonstrated for this practice [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par19">Signs and symptoms of corneal abrasion include burning, itching, and a “sharp sensation” in the eye. Pain is generally worse with blinking and patients will often refuse to open their eyes to prevent the pain from returning. When the eyes are open, patients can exhibit photophobia and blurred vision. Physical exam findings can include excessive tear production, miosis, redness, and irritation.</p><p class="Para" id="Par20">It should be noted that, in general, complete visual loss is rare and unexpected from a corneal abrasion. This said, pediatric patients often have limited ability to discern and describe their symptoms, especially when distressed, in pain, or while recovering from anesthesia. <span id="ITerm13"/><span id="ITerm14"/>It is not uncommon to hear complaints of complete blindness when the true cause is pain and irritation from a new corneal abrasion.</p><p class="Para" id="Par21">Given their relative frequency, there are often department-specific guidelines for treating corneal abrasions that specifically request ophthalmologist available for in-patient consultation, to come to the bedside for a full fundoscopic exam. In large academic centers, for instance, it is not uncommon to have an ophthalmologist evaluate for more serious issues before prescribing eye drops for pain and/or antibiotics. In outpatient surgery or smaller centers, often it is up to the anesthesiologist to diagnose (and follow up on) corneal abrasions. Generally, most treatment protocols will call for a quick examination of the eye, for foreign bodies and saline irrigation to wash out any objects that may be present, followed by prescribing antibiotic drops or ointment and discharge home with follow-up with the ophthalmologist within 1–3 days. In some situations, the anesthesiologist can perform a fluorescein dye exam which allows for quick and easy identification of abrasions of the cornea; however, anesthesiologist’s comfort with this exam varies based on practice setting, training, experience, etc.</p><p class="Para" id="Par22">Newer protocols that allow for streamlined treatment of uncomplicated corneal abrasions by anesthesiologists have been shown to be effective and potentially decrease the time to treatment and cost of care. Requesting a consultation with the inhouse ophthalmologist should be done as soon as possible and prior to discharging the patient home since this can become a medicolegal problem if correct diagnosis and treatment are not undertaken for the patient.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec7"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">3 </span>Ischemic Optic Neuropathy: Symptoms, Pathophysiology, and Prevention</h2><p class="Para" id="Par23"><span id="ITerm15">Ischemic optic neuropathy (ION)</span><span id="ITerm16"/> is characterized by acute damage to the optic nerve by an acute compromise in its blood supply. Unlike corneal abrasion, it is generally painless and leads to complete loss of visual fields in the affected eye. Most commonly in spinal fusions and cardiac surgery, the rate of this complication in these surgeries has continued to drop in the past two decades, likely from the use of less-invasive surgical techniques.</p><p class="Para" id="Par24">Symptoms are most described immediately after emergence from anesthesia, though delayed presentation of 1–2 days has been reported.</p><p class="Para" id="Par25">Two subtypes of ION exist: AION and PION. In AION there is swelling of the head of the optic nerve when viewed radiographically, whereas in the case of PION there is no such swelling. Incidence of AION is far more common than PION.</p><p class="Para" id="Par26">Risk factors for both AION and PION include any state in which blood supply may be compromised. As discussed above, these include hypotension, anemia, and positioning in which pressure may be inadvertently placed on the globe, preventing free blood flow. Multiple studies have shown that both cardiac surgery and spinal fusions are the surgeries during which ION occurs most frequently.</p><p class="Para" id="Par27">When ION is suspected, an immediate ophthalmologic consult is warranted. A fundoscopic exam as well as a test of all visual fields is of paramount importance. Usually imaging such as MRI can be considered to rule out other intracranial pathologies. Further diagnosis is usually directed by ophthalmologists and may include an arterial biopsy as well as an injection of fluorescent dye to evaluate for compromised blood flow.</p><p class="Para" id="Par28">Given the pathophysiology of the disease, the mainstay of treatment revolves around decreasing the swelling around the optic nerve. Long-term steroids are usually prescribed and have varying success depending on patient condition and disease severity.</p><p class="Para" id="Par29">From an anesthesiologist’s <span id="ITerm17">perspective,</span> it is most important to recognize patients who may be at risk for this complication and to manage their blood pressure promptly and aggressively to prevent low perfusion states. As with all patients, proper positioning must be ensured to prevent any state in which flow in the retinal artery or its vascular bed may be decreased. Protection of the eyes by application of a complete covering and avoidance of pressure on the globe during positioning and throughout surgery is vital in children maintained in the prone position.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec8"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">4 </span>Retinal Vascular Occlusion: Etiology and Natural Course</h2><p class="Para" id="Par30"><span id="ITerm18">Retinal vascular occlusion (RVO) </span><span id="ITerm19"/>is an aptly named condition during which blood flow into, or out of, the retina is compromised. As in ischemic optic neuropathy, retinal vascular occlusion is most common in cardiac and spinal surgery and thought to occur from either embolic phenomena or vascular compression states. As with other ocular injuries, poor positioning can lead to decreased blood flow and cause retinal vascular occlusion.</p><p class="Para" id="Par31">A large US study of over five million cardiac procedures from 1998 to 2013 showed that the risk retinal arterial occlusion during cardiac surgery was significantly higher for patients with carotid stenosis, a history of CVA, hypercoagulability, giant cell arteritis, and diabetes [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR13" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par32">Another traditional risk factor for RVO is a retrobulbar block performed by ophthalmologists during surgical procedures. Instillation of local anesthetic in and around the retina can lead to increased venous pressure preventing adequate blood flow to the retina.</p><p class="Para" id="Par33">With RVO, painless visual loss is demonstrated immediately following or soon after surgery. Similar to ION, an ophthalmologic consultation and fundoscopic exam are warranted immediately while excluding other organic causes of visual loss. After diagnosis, treatment focuses on <span id="ITerm20">decreasing</span><span id="ITerm21"/> swelling in the optic vasculature by intravitreal injection of corticosteroids or antivascular endothelial growth factor medications.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec9"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">5 </span>Cortical Blindness: Etiology and Course</h2><div class="Para" id="Par34">The pathophysiology of <span id="ITerm22">cortical blindness</span><span id="ITerm23"/> does not depend on vascular compromise to the structures of the eye. Instead, symptoms result from ischemia of the optic cortex of the brain. Cortical blindness results in a loss of visual fields with a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">normal</em> ophthalmologic examination of the eye as well as normal pupillary responses [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></span>]. Since the perfusion of the visual cortex is fed via “watershed” blood supply, it is particularly vulnerable to injury caused by low perfusion states. This is illustrated in Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">1</a></span>, where blood supply to the <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">central retinal artery</strong> is shown to be the most distal from its supplying vessels (the carotid, middle cerebral, and anterior cerebral arteries). Thus, cortical blindness is likely to co-present with other neurologic symptoms including nausea or sensory deficits, unlike the other diagnoses described above.<figure class="Figure" id="Fig1"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO1"><img alt="" aria-describedby="d64e468" src="../images/516808_1_En_17_Chapter/516808_1_En_17_Fig1_HTML.png" style="width:22.92em"/><div class="TextObject" id="d64e468"><p class="Para" id="Par43">An illustration of blood supply to the eye through an optic nerve.

These include vascular accidents during surgery, prolonged states of poor perfusion including anemia and hypotension or blood loss, as well as prone positioning.</p><p class="Para" id="Par37">In general, symptom presentation can tend to be later than in ION or RVO. CT or MRI findings can demonstrate infarct injuries in the occipital lobe of the affected side, while fundoscopic exam traditionally remains normal.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec10"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">6 </span>Could This Be Related to the Failed Caudal Attempts in Our Patient?</h2><p class="Para" id="Par38"><span id="ITerm26">Vision loss</span> after neuraxial anesthesia is an exceedingly rare complication. After literature review, only ten such cases have been described, all of whom were adult patients presenting lumbar epidural injections [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR18" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></span>]. No pediatric case reports of blindness following either epidural or caudal anesthetics were found. The most likely explanation for these patients is retinal hemorrhage following a rapid rise in cerebrospinal fluid pressure during medication administration. Although the attempted caudal on our patient was unsuccessful, any contribution to the patient’s ocular symptoms from caudal attempt would be extremely unlikely.</p><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec11"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">6.1 </span>What Is the Goal in Assessing This Patient?</h3><p class="Para" id="Par39">When a pediatric patient complains of postoperative visual loss, a great deal of stress and anxiety can be expected—from both the patient and their family. An astute anesthesiologist will approach the complication with a sense of calm and quickly work through their differential. As in any acute neurologic changes, the clinician must quickly determine whether an acute, evolving neurologic insult (i.e., stroke) is evolving in real time. A rapid and thorough neurologic exam should be completed, and if any non-ophthalmologic deficits are revealed, stat cranial imaging should be undertaken.</p><p class="Para" id="Par40">Assuming <span id="ITerm27">visual loss</span> remains the only finding, the anesthesiologist should have a low threshold for an ophthalmologic consult for a full fundoscopic exam.</p><p class="Para" id="Par41">As in most neurologic complications, a rapid diagnosis is key for establishing a treatment plan that gives the patient the best chance of a full recovery.</p><p class="Para" id="Par42">In conclusion, while rare, POVL is an alarming and devastating postoperative complication. By identifying the patient and procedure-specific risk factors, anesthesiologists are empowered to prevent these events. A working knowledge of the most common conditions responsible for POVL allows for an expedient and robust management strategy should this complication occur.</p></section>
