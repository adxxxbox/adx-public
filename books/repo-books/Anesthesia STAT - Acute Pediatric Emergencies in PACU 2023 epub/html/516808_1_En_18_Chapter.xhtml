Intermittent intravenous propranolol was administered to treat elevated blood pressure and heart rate. Small doses of dexmedetomidine were also given and patient was instructed to be kept Nil Per Os and to continue receiving intravenous fluids. She responded to the drugs administered and became sedated with lower heart rate, BP, and respiratory rate. An hour later, patient woke up and complained of having dysphagia and dyspnea, and the PACU anesthesiologist was called urgently to assess. Upon arriving at the bedside, it was evident that there was an expanding hematoma under the incision site which needed urgent surgical evacuation. The need to establish an airway support in the form of endotracheal intubation if the hematoma evacuation is delayed was also clear to the attending anesthesiologist.

Congenital hyperthyroidism is caused by the transfer of maternal thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins in utero. These infants may be premature, and tachycardia, respiratory distress, and congestive heart failure may be present along with physical appearance of goiter. Conversely, Graves’ disease occurs more frequently among adolescents than children and four to five times more frequently among females.</p><p class="Para" id="Par37">Many symptoms and <span id="ITerm10">signs </span>are associated with hyperthyroidism. They are the same for all hyperthyroidism with some exceptions, such as infiltrative ophthalmopathy and dermopathy, which are confined to Graves’ disease. The clinical presentation may be dramatic or subtle.</p><p class="Para" id="Par38">The more common signs of hyperthyroidism (1) <span id="ITerm11">goiter</span>; (2) <span id="ITerm12">tachycardia</span>; (3) widened pulse pressure; (4) warm, fine, moist skin and fingernails may separate from the nail bed; (5) tremor (97%); (6) eye signs (71%); and (7) atrial fibrillation (10%). In hyperthyroidism, the metabolic rate of the body is increased, causing significant changes in the cardiovascular system, proportional to the severity of the thyroid dysfunction.</p><p class="Para" id="Par39">The most frequent symptoms of hyperthyroidism (1) nervousness and increased activity (99%), (2) increased sweating, (3) hypersensitivity to heat, (4) palpitations, (5) fatigue, (6) increased appetite, (7) weight loss, (8) tachycardia, (9) insomnia, (10) weakness, and (11) frequent bowel movements. Eye signs noted in patients with thyrotoxicosis include stare, lid lag, lid retraction, and mild degrees of conjunctival injection or edema-producing symptoms including orbital pain, lacrimation, irritation, and photophobia.</p><p class="Para" id="Par40"><span id="ITerm13">Infiltrative ophthalmopathy</span> is a more serious development and is specific for Graves’ disease. It is characterized by increased retro-orbital tissue, producing exophthalmos, and by lymphocytic infiltration of the extraocular muscles, producing a spectrum of ocular muscle weakness frequently leading to blurred and double vision. The pathogenesis of infiltrative ophthalmopathy is poorly understood. It may occur before the onset of hyperthyroidism or as late as 15–20 years afterward and frequently worsens or improves independent of the clinical course of hyperthyroidism.</p><p class="Para" id="Par41"><span id="ITerm14">Infiltrative dermopathy</span>, also known as pretibial myxedema (a confusing term, since myxedema suggests hypothyroidism), is characterized by nonpitting infiltration of mucinous ground substance, usually in the pretibial area. The lesion is very pruritic and erythematous in its early stages and subsequently becomes brawny. Like ophthalmopathy, infiltrative dermopathy may appear years before or after hyperthyroidism.</p><p class="Para" id="Par42">The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism depends on a careful clinical history and physical examination, a high index of suspicion, and routine thyroid hormone determinations. A serum T<sub>4</sub> assay and a T<sub>3</sub> resin uptake test are a highly accurate combination of initial tests for assessing thyroid status. Mild to moderate hyperthyroidism may be difficult to diagnose clinically during pregnancy since many normal parturients experience tachycardia, heat intolerance, and emotional instability. In hyperthyroidism, there is increased T<sub>4</sub>, increased RT<sub>3</sub>U, and increased T<sub>3</sub>, while in pregnancy there is increased T<sub>4</sub>, decreased RT<sub>3</sub>U, and normal T<sub>3</sub>. Age-adjusted normal values are needed because thyroid hormone levels are higher in children [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par43"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Preoperatively</em>, elective surgery should be deferred until the patient has been rendered euthyroid and the hyperdynamic cardiovascular system has been controlled with a beta antagonist, as evidenced by an acceptable resting heart rate. The child should have received ablation treatment to ensure a euthyroid state confirmed by preoperative thyroid function tests. All drugs being administered to manage the hyperthyroid state should be continued through the perioperative period. One week before surgery, administration of Lugol’s iodine solution may be initiated to decrease vascularity and hyperplasia of the overreactive gland.</p><p class="Para" id="Par44">When surgery cannot be delayed in a symptomatic hyperthyroid patient, the continuous infusion of a beta blocker may be useful for the control of cardiovascular responses evoked by sympathetic nervous system stimulation [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></span>]. Poor control of hyperthyroidism and surgery are associated with an increased risk of the development of thyroid storm.</p><p class="Para" id="Par45">Anxiety relief is often provided by the oral administration of a benzodiazepine. The use of an anticholinergic drug is not recommended, since such a drug could interfere with the body’s normal heat-regulating mechanism and contribute to an increase in heart rate. Evaluation of the upper airway for evidence of obstruction is an important part of the preoperative preparation. A large goiter requires a computed axial tomography scan to determine if tracheal compression or deviation exists. <span id="ITerm15">Propranolol</span> may be used preoperatively to control tachycardia [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></span>–<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR6" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par46"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Induction of anesthesia</em> <span id="ITerm16"/>is usually achieved with intravenous induction drugs.</p><p class="Para" id="Par47">Patients do best with premedication with midazolam in the preoperative area followed by a smooth induction with preoxygenation and intravenous line placement followed by intravenous drugs like propofol with frequent checks on hemodynamic stability.</p><p class="Para" id="Par48"><span id="ITerm17">Ketamine</span> is not an appropriate selection because it can stimulate the sympathetic nervous system.

Placement of artificial tears and eye lubricant is advised. Covering both eyes with soft cotton gauge and placing OPSITE over the protuberant eyes completely may be sufficient although goggles have been placed in patients with very protuberant eyes. It is optimal to continue to monitor the eyes to prevent any pressure over it from surgeon’s hands or retractors since the surgical site is close to the face.</p><p class="Para" id="Par51">During positioning of these patients, slight head-up position is often requested by surgeons to allow increased venous drainage of the surgical site [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">9</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par52"><span id="ITerm19">General anesthesia</span> is usually maintained with a combination of inhalational agent and intravenous anesthetics since neuromuscular agents are often avoided. <span id="ITerm20">Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA)</span> can also be achieved with propofol, because of rapid-onset and quick recovery potential. In addition, short-acting narcotics like remifentanil can be given as an infusion for continuous analgesia. Intravenous dexmedetomidine can be helpful to counter sudden increase in heart rate during surgical manipulation of the thyroid. Most commonly, a combination of inhalational anesthetic and intravenous anesthetic is chosen to achieve hemodynamic stability during thyroid surgery.</p><p class="Para" id="Par53">Intraoperatively, there may be transient episodes of tachycardia and hypertension attributed to increased levels of thyroxine being released during surgical manipulation and can be treated with small doses of propranolol and intravenous dexmedetomidine.</p><p class="Para" id="Par54">A second intravenous line is usually necessary to be placed to enable the anesthesiologist to draw lab specimens intraoperatively.</p><div class="Para" id="Par55">The anesthesiologist should be familiar with the proper use and functioning of the neural integrity monitor (NIM) electromyogram (EMG) tracheal tube. The use of the specialized neural integrity monitor electromyogram (NIM EMG) endotracheal tubes to accurately monitor amplitude and latency changes requires optimal placement at the vocal cords to allow neuromonitoring (Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2">2</a></span>). Proper understanding of its structure and function is essential for the anesthesiologist. It is frequently being utilized, for the head and neck procedures, when laryngeal nerves could be injured during the process of surgical dissection.

A retrospective study of 113 children who underwent thyroid surgery between 2001 and 2019 showed that use of IONM was associated with decreased rate of RLN injury during pediatric thyroid surgery [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par58">If the plan is to avoid <span id="ITerm23">neuromuscular blockade</span>, the induction can be accomplished by a combination of inhalation agent sevoflurane and intravenous hypnotics and narcotics. When the depth of anesthesia is sufficient for performing a direct laryngoscopy, it is useful to spray the larynx and the vocal cords with 2% lidocaine spray prior to intubation.</p><p class="Para" id="Par59">If the goiter is large, the difficulty with tracheal intubation is mainly from reduced mobility of the underlying structures. The use of video laryngoscope such as GlideScope has improved visualization of vocal cords and tracheal intubation in patients with potential for difficult airway.</p><p class="Para" id="Par60">If the special NIM EMG tube is not being used, then neuromuscular paralysis may be used. To facilitate tracheal intubation, a depolarizing agent may be required. Preparalytic, as well as postparalytic, assessment of train-of-four monitoring should be conducted with documentation of the <span id="ITerm24">return </span>of neuromuscular function. If requested by the surgeon, the selection of a muscle relaxant should include consideration of the potential impact of this drug on the sympathetic nervous system. Pancuronium is not an appropriate selection, in view of the ability of this drug to increase heart rate and thereby mimic sympathetic nervous system stimulation.</p><p class="Para" id="Par61"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Goals during maintenance of</em> <span id="ITerm25"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">anesthesia</em></span> for a hyperthyroid patient are to avoid the administration of drugs that stimulate the sympathetic nervous system and to provide sufficient anesthetic depression to prevent an exaggerated response to surgical stimulation. The possibility of organ toxicity owing to altered or accelerated drug metabolism in the presence of hyperthyroidism must also be considered when selecting drugs for maintenance of anesthesia. The use of volatile agents is acceptable. Increased cardiac output and temperature may result in an increased <span id="ITerm26">minimum alveolar concentration (MAC)</span> for the volatile agents. High-dose narcotics would be required to provide adequate inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system. Muscle relaxation, as described above, should be avoided, but if requested, the choice of a nondepolarizing agents with minimal cardiac effects is preferable. A prolonged response to nondepolarizing agents may occur in patients with preexisting muscle weakness. Hypercarbia will result in stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and should therefore be avoided. In the presence of tachycardia, the use of beta blockers during the perioperative period is essential. Treatment of hypotension, if needed, is best achieved with the use of a direct-acting agent such as phenylephrine rather than agents such as ephedrine, which act in part by an indirect mechanism. Constant monitoring of body temperature is essential.</p><p class="Para" id="Par62">Regional anesthesia with its associated blockade of the sympathetic nervous system is a potentially useful selection for the hyperthyroid patient, assuming there is no evidence of high-output congestive heart failure. <span id="ITerm27">Epinephrine</span> is to be avoided in the local anesthetic solution, as systemic absorption of this catecholamine could produce an exaggerated circulatory response.</p><p class="Para" id="Par63">Every effort must be taken to decrease or possibly eliminate the potential for postoperative vomiting in patients with thyroid surgery. Incidence of vomiting is high in patients after thyroid surgery, and this can increase postoperative bleeding and hematoma formation which can lead to airway obstruction. Vagal stimulation from the surgical manipulation of neck structures during surgery, female gender, age, and history of motion sickness all contribute to increase incidence of postoperative vomiting.

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec6"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">3 </span>Summary</h2><p class="Para" id="Par73">Caregivers should be vigilant about the possibility of occurrence of a thyroid storm in the postoperative period even after total thyroidectomy. This patient was found to be noncompliant to medication intake and showed clinical signs of thyroid storm even after complete removal of the thyroid gland. In the adolescent and young adult, the fractional rate of turnover of T4 in the periphery is normally about 10%/d (half-life, 6.7 d). The half-life of thyroxine is inversely related to the initial serum thyroxine levels<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">.</strong> Large quantities of thyroglobulin are released into the blood during surgical manipulation of the thyroid [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR20" role="doc-biblioref">20</a></span>]. Metabolic and hemodynamic manifestations of thyrotoxicosis may be masked intraoperatively by anesthetics and sedation and exaggerated in the postoperative period. The diagnosis of a thyrotoxic crisis is made entirely on the clinical findings. Most importantly, there is no difference in thyroid hormone levels between patients with “uncomplicated” thyrotoxicosis and those undergoing a thyroid storm. Any delay in therapy, such as awaiting additional laboratory results, must be strictly avoided, because the mortality rate may rise to 75%. Treatment of a thyroid storm must be immediate and should occur in an intensive care setting. Monitoring in an acute care setting with tight control of blood pressure is often needed to manage a developing thyroid storm. Surgical outcomes after thyroid surgery at a single center in 464 patients with a median age of 15 years reported that six patients required return to the OR for hematoma evacuation including five patients after surgery for Graves’ disease [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">21</a></span>]. The possibility of acute postoperative thyroid storm leading to acute airway loss from an expanding neck hematoma should be considered in patients with poor medical compliance [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR22" role="doc-biblioref">22</a></span>].</p></section>
