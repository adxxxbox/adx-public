The patient’s mother accompanies her and states that her daughter has a history of sickle cell disease (SCD) and has had multiple vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) in the past requiring inpatient admissions for treatment but that she had not had any admissions or transfusions in the past 6 months prior to surgery. The mother also says that her daughter had an adenotonsillectomy for OSA as a toddler but had no anesthetic complications and reports no known drug allergies.

Hemoglobin A (also known as adult hemoglobin, A<sub>1</sub>, or α2β2) is the most common making up 95–98% of hemoglobin and consists of two α and two β-globin chains. Hemoglobin A<sub>2</sub> (α<sub>2</sub>δ<sub>2</sub>) and fetal hemoglobin (α<sub>2</sub>γ<sub>2</sub>) are less common, and other forms of hemoglobin, such as C, D, and E, are even more rare [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>]. The α- and β-globin chains that make up HbA are produced by the genes known as HBA and HBB, respectively. Hemoglobin S (HbS), or sickle hemoglobin, occurs when a nucleotide, specifically glutamic acid, is substituted for valine at the sixth position on the HBB gene causing an abnormal version of the β-globin chain [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>]. HbS proteins have the potential when oxygen is low to stick together inside erythrocytes forming long chains called polymers. Polymerization subsequentially produces conformational changes of erythrocytes altering their shape into sickles or crescent-like shapes resembling the harvesting tool (Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">1</a></span>). When a child inherits the mutated allele from both parents, they are homozygous recessive for HbS and have sickle cell disease, also known as SCD or HbSS. Sickle cell trait (SCT), which generally bears no clinical significance, is a heterozygous and often benign state that occurs when a person inherits one normal hemoglobin and one abnormal β-globin gene, such as β-thalassemia (HbSβ), C (HbSC), or D-Punjab (HbSD) [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par10">Although SCD is considered a genetic disorder, environmental factors in history may have triggered the first mutation of the gene [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></span>]. The outbreak of plasmodium falciparum malaria in Africa, India, and the Middle East, secondary to deforestation and stagnant pools of water, coincides with the advent of the mutation. In the 1940s, J. B. S. Haladane observed that red blood cell disorders, such as SCD, were more common in areas where malaria was endemic and that individuals with these disorders did not contract malaria, and therefore he proposed the genetic link between the malaria endemic and the sickle cell gene (Haladane 1949) [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></span>]. This theory may explain why SCD is more common among individuals of African descent.</p><div class="Para" id="Par11">SCD is diagnosed in nearly 275,000 children annually worldwide, and more than two million people throughout the world carry SCT [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></span>].

The life expectancy of Americans living with SCD is reduced to between 42 and 48 years due to complications of the disease, but improved newborn screening, vaccines, and antibiotic therapy, as well as other innovative treatments over the past two decades, have contributed to earlier diagnosis, better treatment options, and longer survival of individuals living with SCD [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR6" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></span>].<figure class="Figure" id="Fig1"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO1"><img alt="" aria-describedby="d64e284" src="../images/516808_1_En_24_Chapter/516808_1_En_24_Fig1_HTML.png" style="width:34.18em"/><div class="TextObject" id="d64e284"><p class="Para" id="Par38">2 electron microscopic images.

Hypoxia may trigger polymerization of HbS and subsequent sickling of erythrocytes leading to an acute painful episode often referred to as a “sickle cell crisis” or vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). Acidosis which decreases hemoglobin’s affinity for oxygen may also cause sickling. Dehydration not only contributes to sickling by decreasing the osmolality of plasma which increases the concentration of HbS inside the erythrocyte but also decreases the volume and increases the viscosity of plasma resulting in slower blood flow through capillaries. Hypothermia triggers vasoconstriction limiting blood flow to organs which can also decrease the exchange of oxygen by the lungs worsening hypoxia and sickling. VOC symptoms and severity vary between individuals, but hemolytic anemia, infection, and organ damage can result from VOC [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></span>].</p><div class="Para" id="Par13">Ninety percent of children have nonfunctioning spleens by the age of 6 due to multiple splenic microinfarcts secondary to VOC which leads to an increased risk of infection [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>]. <span id="ITerm2">Acute chest syndrome (ACS)</span> results when there is an area of poor ventilation within the lungs from an infection, such as RSV, causing a V/Q mismatch which leads to hypoxia, acidosis, and subsequent sickling which in turn leads to poor pulmonary perfusion and worsening hypoxia and further sickling [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>]. ACS is more common in children between the ages of 2 and 4, and they often present with fever, respiratory symptoms, and chest pain [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>]. The major clinical expressions of SCD are listed in Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">1</a></span>. In addition to ACS, other serious life-threatening complications can occur, such as cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, aplastic anemia, and acute renal failure. The most common permanent sequelae in patients with SCD are ischemic stroke and silent cerebral infarcts that can lead to cognitive impairment, disability, and death and occur in approximately 20% of patients with SCD by the age of 40 [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">9</a></span>].

The most common elective surgeries that children with SCD present to the operating room for are cholecystectomy, adenotonsillectomy, splenectomy, umbilical hernia repair, appendectomy, myringotomy, inguinal hernia repair, and hip replacement [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></span>]. Children with SCD may have high unconjugated bilirubin levels chronically leading to gallstones requiring gall bladder removal.

<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec5"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">1.4 </span>What Other Disease States Are Associated With Sickle Cell Disease and May Affect Perioperative Outcomes?</h3><div class="Para" id="Par16">Children with SCD <span id="ITerm5">are </span>predisposed to vasculopathies. Moyamoya disease (MMD) is the presence of idiopathic internal carotid stenosis. Moyamoya is a Japanese word meaning “puff-of-smoke” which is how the stenotic arteries appear on cerebral angiogram (Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2">2</a></span>). When this stenosis occurs in the setting of SCD, it is called moyamoya syndrome [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>]. Sickle cell-induced moyamoya syndrome (SCD-MMS) has been reported to occur in as many as 43% of all patients with SCD and occurs more commonly in SCD patients with abnormal transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></span>]. Although TCD velocities can be used to screen SCD patients for cerebral vasculopathy, a cerebral angiogram or MRI should be done to confirm the diagnosis of SCD-MMS. SCD-MMS patients have greater than 12 times the risk of cerebral infarction making them high risk for neurologic complications especially perioperatively [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR12" role="doc-biblioref">12</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR13" role="doc-biblioref">13</a></span>].

<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec7"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">1.6 </span>How Will You Preoperatively Assess Sickle Cell Patients and Plan for Surgery?</h3><p class="Para" id="Par18">Since there are no published reports that <span id="ITerm10">preoperative</span> screening for SCD decreases perioperative morbidity or mortality, routine preoperative screening for SCD is not recommended especially if neonatal screening is available locally [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></span>]. If neonatal screening is not available, some researchers argue that preoperative screening for SCD in regions where malaria remains endemic should be considered although this may not be practical or affordable in resource-poor countries [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></span>]. Most researchers agree that tailored perioperative care for children with SCD who are under 6 months of age presenting for surgery is unnecessary, since infants rarely manifest SCD-associated symptoms [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR14" role="doc-biblioref">14</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par19">For those patients with SCD who are older than 6 months of age, a preoperative evaluation is recommended either in person or virtually to ensure the patient is medically optimized prior to surgery [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">17</a></span>]. Additional goals of the preoperative evaluation are to estimate the risk associated with the surgery and create an individualized anesthetic plan that will minimize perioperative complications associated with SCD [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">17</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par20">A thorough history and complete physical examination should <span id="ITerm11">be</span> performed. A detailed history of pain and pain treatment strategies should be documented and may assist in perioperative pain management, especially in patients who have developed chronic pain, central desensitization, hyperalgesia syndrome, and opioid tolerance [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></span>]. Many researchers recommend a detailed nervous system exam including TCD velocities, cerebral angiography, or MRI preoperatively to screen for SCD-MMS and other vasculopathies that may increase the risk of stroke [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></span>]. An echocardiogram should be obtained for patients with a history of cardiac disease and obstructive sleep apnea. A complete blood count with differential should be obtained preoperatively, especially for those patients taking hydroxyurea which can cause neutropenia. Hemoglobin S percentage should be determined by electrophoresis or high-performance liquid chromatography prior to any medium- to high-risk surgery [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></span>]. Since many SCD patients have had a prior blood transfusion and therefore mounted an immune response (i.e., alloimmunization), a type and crossmatch should be done prior to surgery even if intraoperative transfusion is unlikely. Other laboratory studies, such as renal and liver function tests and a chest radiograph, should be tailored to the patient’s history and the procedure being performed.</p><p class="Para" id="Par21">Preoperative counseling to the patient and caregivers on how to avoid triggers of VOC, such as anxiety, stress, infection, and dehydration, should be included in the preoperative discussion [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">17</a></span>].

Anxiety can cause breath-holding and hypoxia triggering VOC. Patients with SCD should be scheduled as the first case of the day to reduce anxiety and minimize the risk of dehydration from prolonged fasting. Ambulatory surgery should be discouraged since patients must be monitored by experienced clinicians postoperatively for complications, although some argue that ambulatory surgery can be done safely if the patient is the first surgery of the day leaving plenty of time for postoperative monitoring [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></span>].

A multicenter randomized controlled trial from 2013 of patients over the age of 1 with red blood cell disorders presenting for low- to medium-risk surgery described a significantly higher rate of perioperative complications, especially ACS, in patients who were not transfused and reported no transfusion reactions [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR19" role="doc-biblioref">19</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR20" role="doc-biblioref">20</a></span>]. Another analysis of 79 patients with SCD and abnormal TCD velocities found a higher rate of new MRI brain infarcts among patients who discontinued chronic transfusion therapy and therefore recommend transfusion therapy for SCD patients with a high risk of having cerebrovascular events [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR18" role="doc-biblioref">18</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR19" role="doc-biblioref">19</a></span>].

Despite varying reports, preoperative transfusions of packed red blood cells up to a hemoglobin of 10 g dL<sup>−1</sup> have become commonplace for all children undergoing low- to medium-risk surgery in the United States [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>]. For children undergoing high-risk surgery, such as neurosurgery, cardiothoracic surgery, or major orthopedic surgery, or who are at high risk for perioperative complications due to previous stroke, ACS, or renal failure, exchange transfusions aiming for a hemoglobin of 10 g dL<sup>−1</sup> and HbS &lt; 30% are recommended [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR18" role="doc-biblioref">18</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR19" role="doc-biblioref">19</a></span>].</p></section>

Preoperative anxiolysis may be required, since perioperative anxiety can lead to breath-holding, hypoxia, and sickling [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></span>]. During the induction and emergence of anesthesia, obstruction and laryngospasm should be avoided or rapidly diagnosed and treated to minimize hypoxia. Hypoventilation and atelectasis should also be avoided, so controlled ventilation and the use of muscle relaxants may be preferred especially for laparoscopic procedures. To reduce the risk of infection postoperatively, prophylactic antibiotic administration is recommended for all procedures. The use of intraoperative tourniquets in sickle cell patients undergoing orthopedic surgery remains controversial, because there are no randomized controlled trials offering conclusive evidence. Some argue that tourniquets cause stasis, hypoxia, and acidosis which can trigger polymerization and sickling, but there are many reports of tourniquets being used in SCD patients without complications when vigilance is maintained. Overall, the benefits of less blood loss and therefore the avoidance of hypotension may outweigh the risk of the tourniquet triggering VOC [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR17" role="doc-biblioref">17</a></span>].

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec17"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">5 </span>Summary and Conclusion</h2><p class="Para" id="Par37">Children with SCD are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality during the perioperative period, and therefore careful preoperative assessment and planning are essential to reduce postoperative complications, such as ischemic stroke seen in this patient. SCD patients with abnormal TCD velocities are especially at risk for postoperative cerebrovascular events, and therefore all SCD patients should be screened preoperatively for SCD-MMS. Patients with SCD-MMS should consider early indirect revascularization surgery, which has been shown to be safe and efficacious in reducing the lifetime risk of cerebral infarcts and neurologic complications, prior to other elective surgeries. SCD-MMS patients having revascularization surgery should be monitored intraoperatively using EEG. <span id="ITerm34">Laparoscopic surgery</span>, rather than open abdominal surgery, lowers the risk of postoperative ACS. Although preoperative transfusions remain controversial in SCD patients who do not have MMS, all SCD patients having major surgery should be transfused to a hemoglobin of 10 g dL<sup>−1</sup> and a HbS &lt; 30% to reduce the risk of perioperative complications. Perioperative reduction of hypoxia, hypothermia, hypotension, and acidosis reduces the likelihood of polymerization and sickling. <span id="ITerm35">Tourniquets</span> can be used safely intraoperatively to reduce blood loss and minimize hypotension, but cell salvage is not recommended. Antibiotic and DVT prophylaxis are important to prevent infection and blood clots, respectively. Regional anesthesia can be done safely and may improve analgesia and blood flow to the surgical site reducing the risk of sickling. Pre- and postoperative incentive spirometry can reduce the incidence of ACS. <span id="ITerm36">NIRS</span> may be a useful tool to detect changes in brain oxygenation and therefore reduce the risk of ischemic stroke perioperatively in patients with abnormal TCD velocities or SCD-MMS. All SCD patients should be monitored postoperatively and neurologic changes should be addressed and treated immediately to avoid long-term sequelae.</p></section>
