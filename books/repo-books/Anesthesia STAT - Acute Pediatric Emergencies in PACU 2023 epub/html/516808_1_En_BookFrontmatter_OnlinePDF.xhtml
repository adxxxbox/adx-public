The authors will first focus on how clinical monitoring and safety of our post-op patients can and must continue after we hand off their care to the PACU team and then describe 24 interesting clinical scenarios that needed urgent intervention in PACU.</p><p class="Para" id="Par9">The task is undertaken by authors who are friends and colleagues, who describe these clinical scenarios from their experience of caring for children who developed these complications.</p><p class="Para" id="Par10"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Chapter</strong><span class="ExternalRef"><a href="516808_1_En_1_Chapter.xhtml"><span class="RefSource"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">1</strong></span></a></span> is an introduction to this book—about nuts and bolts of post-op handoff and why the transfer of information of surgical patient is important for post-op care in pediatric anesthesia. It is titled “Passing the Baton” as in a relay race scenario and is about the transfer of patient’s medical and surgical information or the “Baton” between members of the relay team.</p><p class="Para" id="Par11">The focus of the first half is on how checklists became an important part of handoffs historically and why an ideal complete handoff is necessary for continuation of the patient’s safety. The specific focus on lateral or recovery positioning of patients postoperatively and the scientific reason why an emerging patient should be in lateral position is described with studies to support the importance of this positioning. This is one simple effective technique used by the author <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Dr. Susan T. Verghese</strong> to maintain airway patency of all patients during transport from OR to PACU. The second half is authored by two experienced nurses at Children’s PACU team: <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Ms. Kathleen Curtis BSN, RN, and Ms. Susan P. Joslyn BSN, RN.</strong> They highlight the physical PACU setup, the flow of cases from Phase 1 to Phase 2 and the clinical problems seen in pediatric patients from the PACU nursing perspective.</p><p class="Para" id="Par12">The first clinical scenario by <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Giuliana Geng-Ramos,</strong> is about a young child developing anaphylaxis after administration of antibiotic in PACU.</p><p class="Para" id="Par13">The next clinical scenario titled somnolence in an infant after VP shunt revision is by <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Dr</strong>. <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Nina Deutsch</strong> who discusses the etiology of lethargy in a child after placement of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt.</p><p class="Para" id="Par14"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Dr. Chaitanya Challa</strong> takes on the task of detailing an undesirable post-op problem in PACU by describing the scenario of emergence delirium in a toddler after surgery.</p><p class="Para" id="Par15">An unusual complication of cardiac arrest after central line placement in a child in PACU is described by <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Dr. Chinwe Unegbu</strong>.</p><p class="Para" id="Par16">A 7-year-old young child who has a loose tooth pre-operatively seems to have lost it on arrival to PACU! <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Dr. Jonathan Maxwell Teets</strong> takes the reader through a hide and seek game where the tooth was there before but not now! Where is it? Who saw it last?</p><p class="Para" id="Par17">It is unusual to anticipate problems after a bone marrow biopsy in a child with leukemia. <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Dr. Andrew Matisoff</strong> describes a sudden clinical deterioration in a young child who develops intractable cardiac arrythmias after anesthesia for a brief surgical procedure.</p><p class="Para" id="Par18"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Dr. Cassie Rim</strong> describes another rare but clinically fascinating scenario where an obese teenager develops shoulder pain and tachycardia after a liver biopsy performed by the interventional radiologist under fluoroscopic guidance.</p><p class="Para" id="Par19">In a scenario of acute oxygen desaturation in a healthy teen on arrival to PACU after hardware removal, <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Dr. Dan Vuong Thoai</strong> describes a classic clinical picture of negative pressure pulmonary edema developing from airway obstruction.</p><p class="Para" id="Par20">Establishing Latex-free OR environment has made allergic reactions to latex, a rare occurrence. <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Dr. Mingfei Wang</strong> takes the reader through an unanticipated case scenario of a child with Spina Bifida developing latex allergy in PACU.</p><p class="Para" id="Par21">In another interesting clinical scenario, Dr. <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">David Rico Mora,</strong> describes acute O<sub>2</sub> desaturation developing in a teenager in PACU after esophagoscopy and esophageal dilatation.</p><p class="Para" id="Par22">Although the lateral positioning of patient is the most beneficial position in patients with OSA, this position may not be possible for the patient to assume in some cases. <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Dr. Daniela Perez Velasco</strong> describes the problem of respiratory arrest occurring in a teen with obesity and OSA after a cardiac catheterization procedure.</p><p class="Para" id="Par23">Caudal anesthesia is an easily performed regional technique used in children to provide intra-operative and postoperative analgesia for urological surgery. <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Dr. Elisha Peterson</strong> describes the complication of weakness and the inability to walk in a toddler in PACU after a caudal block.</p><p class="Para" id="Par24"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Dr. Pooja Gupta</strong> draws an informative clinical picture of the acute complication of post-extubation croupy cough and desaturation in ex-premature toddler. She highlights important techniques to minimize the development of croup and the ways to treat it in PACU.</p><p class="Para" id="Par25"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Dr. Philip Dela Merced</strong> describes the genesis of apnea in an ex-premature infant undergoing hernia repair under spinal anesthesia and describes the current treatment available for this complication.</p><p class="Para" id="Par26"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Dr. Nina Rawtani</strong> gives the reader a comprehensive clinical picture of a child with persistent vomiting after eye muscle surgery.

Santos</strong> takes the readers through a maze of causes for sudden fever after dental rehabilitation in a child. Wait, but could this be malignant hyperthermia?</p><p class="Para" id="Par32"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Dr. Angela Lee</strong> details an urgent scenario of a young child vomiting blood in PACU after T&amp;A and enumerates steps to treat this perilous complication promptly to decrease morbidity.</p><p class="Para" id="Par33"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Dr. Phayon Lee</strong> describes the scenario of a morbidly obese teenager developing acute oxygen desaturation shortly after arrival to PACU.
