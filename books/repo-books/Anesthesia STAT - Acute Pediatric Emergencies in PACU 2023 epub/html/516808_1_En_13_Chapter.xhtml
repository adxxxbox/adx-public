He had an uneventful inhalational anesthetic induction with oxygen nitrous oxide and sevoflurane by mask followed by an intravenous line placement on his left hand and easy placement of LMA. A caudal block was placed with the patient positioned with knees bent and legs flexed upward in the left lateral position using a sterile technique. He received an epidural single shot via caudal approach of 11 mL of 0.2% ropivacaine administered in slow incremental doses. The surgery proceeded smoothly with the patient breathing spontaneously via an LMA, 60% oxygen 40% air and less than 2.7% sevoflurane, requiring no narcotics or intravenous agents. Having confirmed the success of the caudal block, the LMA was removed deep, and he was transferred to the PACU lying on his side with an oral airway in place. Vital signs on arrival to PACU were stable, and during the hand off to the PACU nurse, the anesthesiologist emphasized that the caudal block was easy</em><span id="ITerm2"/> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">to perform and was assessed to be successful during the intraoperative period. Upon waking up after 10 min, he cried and moved his right leg as he spat out the oral airway but did not appear to move his left leg at all. He appeared agitated when his left leg was lifted off the bed and cried until he was reunited with his parents. The parents were allowed to hold him and notices that he is not moving his left leg at all. The PACU nurse calls the PACU attending saying that the parents are with the child and want to know the reason for this left foot weakness. You arrive at the bedside and evaluate the clinical situation. He appears comfortable, drinking his bottle, and his vital signs are stable. On examination, the right leg is held normal and responds to tickling but he shows</em><span id="ITerm3"/> <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">no response to tickling his left foot.</em></p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec6"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">6 </span>Discussion</h2><p class="Para" id="Par12">Caudal blocks are simple and easy to perform, and they have a lower learning curve than other regional anesthesia techniques [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>]. Caudal approach to epidural is the most common regional block in pediatric anesthesiology [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>–<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></span>]. For surgical procedures inferior to the umbilicus, caudal approach provides targeted dense analgesia which decreases the amount of volatile anesthetic and systemic analgesics needed throughout the perioperative period which results in decreased time in the hospital [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par13">Caudal blocks are also safe to perform with a complication rate of 3% in children for single caudal shots. The most common problem during single-shot caudal is the technical challenge to identify the epidural space resulting in block failure [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></span>]. Other <span id="ITerm9">complications</span> from caudal approach to epidural include violation of dura, blood vessel, rectum, seizure, cardiac arrest, urinary retention and/or incontinence, pain, paresthesia, or transient neurologic deficit and extremely rare possibility of permanent neurologic damage [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></span>–<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></span>]. In a cohort of over 18,000 children, rate of seizures and cardiac arrest occurred in 2/10,000 cases [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></span>]. No complication lasted longer than 3 months [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par14">Most caudal blocks are performed as a single shot, where a dose of local anesthetic is deposited in the epidural space [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>]. Catheters can be left in the epidural space through the caudal approach, but this clinical practice is less common. Contraindications to caudal block are spinal dysraphism, pilonidal cyst, localized infection, spinal anomalies, bleeding disorders, or coagulation disorders [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par15">Pediatric <span id="ITerm10">caudal blocks</span> can be conducted via a palpation technique based purely on landmarks or a technique based on ultrasound guidance. The ultrasound is easy to use and radiation-free and can provide real-time images in guiding the needle entry into the caudal space. This technique however has not gained popularity perhaps due to the current high success of caudal blocks accomplished by using landmarks in children with low complications.</p><p class="Para" id="Par16"><span id="ITerm11">In adults</span> with chronic pain, fluoroscopic guidance is used for definitive confirmation during placement of specific drugs for blocking pain fibers arising from the lower lumbar and sacral segments.</p><p class="Para" id="Par17">A technique based on <span id="ITerm12">anatomic landmarks</span> is the most common technique for performing a caudal epidural block in <span id="ITerm13">children</span>. Caudal blocks in children are mainly performed after the patient has undergone a general anesthetic with an airway device and an intravenous line in place [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></span>]. Patients are positioned on their side with knees, hips, and neck in a flexed position to facilitate palpation of anatomical landmarks and to decrease risk dural sac puncture [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>].</p><div class="Para" id="Par18">The <span id="ITerm14">anatomic landmarks</span> form an inverted triangle with the posterior superior iliac spines as the base and the sacral hiatus forming the apex (Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">1a, b</a></span>). Needle should be positioned at a 45-degree angle to the horizontal plane in between the sacral cornua into the sacral hiatus [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>]. A distinct “pop” or “sudden give” sensed by the proceduralist’s hand while advancing the needle often indicates the entry into the caudal epidural space. The loss of resistance thus sensed is an important sign sought in confirming successful needle entry in the landmark technique to caudal block. The epidural <span id="ITerm15">space</span> is encountered by piercing the sacrococcygeal ligament which lies between the sacral cornua [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>]. The angle of the beveled needle is then flattened once the sacrococcygeal ligament is perforated in the sacral hiatus. A common mistake is directing the needle, deep perpendicularly, without flattening and hitting the bone beneath instead of entering the sacrococcygeal ligament. The termination of the spinal cord in adults is at L1–2 and the dural sac at S1–2. In children the spinal cord terminates much lower at L3–4 and the dural sac at S3–4. Therefore, there is a possibility of inadvertent needle entry into the dural sac during the performance of a caudal block in young infants. If heme or spinal fluid is encountered during needle puncture, then the needle is removed, and a decision can be made to try again with the use of imaging guidance or abort the procedure. If subcutaneous injection is encountered, reattempt can be made with a steeper needle angle. The administration of the desired volume of the local anesthetic is usually done in 2 mL aliquots with the needle held steady with the operator’s left hand and a negative aspiration of blood or spinal fluid confirmed by the right hand before administering the next 2 mL bolus.<figure class="Figure" id="Fig1"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO1"><img alt="" aria-describedby="d64e451" src="../images/516808_1_En_13_Chapter/516808_1_En_13_Fig1_HTML.png" style="width:34.48em"/><div class="TextObject" id="d64e451"><p class="Para" id="Par41">A photograph of a child's sacral triangle at the hip area with the P S I S, S C, S H, coccyx, S C, and P S I S labels.

A low-concentration high-volume injectate strategy is more efficacious than a high-concentration low-volume strategy for caudal blocks in children if a higher-level sensory block is required [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">9</a></span>]. In a single-center study in children undergoing orchiopexy, the researchers found that a higher volume (1 mL/kg) of a 0.20% bupivacaine decreased reactivity to spermatic cord traction intraoperatively than 0.8 mL/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine without any change in the quality of postop analgesia [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par24"><span id="ITerm21"><strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">Additives</strong></span> can be included with the local anesthetic to prolong block duration such as sodium bicarbonate, epinephrine, morphine, clonidine, dexmedetomidine, midazolam, ketamine, neostigmine, and dexamethasone. A meta-analysis of 15 studies concluded that alpha 2 agonists prolong block duration with less side effects than other adjuvants but could not offer an ideal dose for alpha 2 agonist due to mixed results of these studies and publication bias [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></span>].

Ultrasound can be used for caudal injections under real time by placing a linear probe ultrasound in a long axis along the lumbar spine.

Obtaining written consent for caudal spinal or epidural in children is currently not in existence although its need is debated often. The volume of same-day surgeries is increasing, leading to shorter time for preoperative interview in most surgical centers. The anesthetic consent is often included in the surgical consent, and therefore a separate signed consent is currently not necessary before proceeding to the administration of general anesthesia. Informing parents about the specific regional technique planned, including its complications and side effects, is done during the preoperative visit. In turn, the parents usually express their willingness to go ahead with the plan for their child and ask questions related to the type of anesthetic procedure and the reason for the choice of regional block if they are knowledgeable or familiar with these blocks. It is important to document this preoperative discussion and verbal consent in the electronic chart of the patient with a witness if necessary.</p><p class="Para" id="Par39">Most parents and caregivers have poor recall of verbally detailed discussion, and there is always a possibility of saying that they were uninformed about the specific complication that occurred in their child. The quality of information regarding adjunct procedures and regional blocks can be improved by providing parents with information leaflets and documenting that a valid informed consent was obtained. This time-consuming yet legally necessary documentation can be helpful in preventing parental dissatisfaction and escalation to a legal malpractice claim [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">21</a></span>].</p></section>

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec13"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">7 </span>Conclusion</h2><p class="Para" id="Par40">Caudal block in children is a versatile regional block that provides both intraoperative and postoperative analgesia in young, anesthetized children for surgeries below the umbilicus. It is the most utilized, easy to learn regional technique currently performed with a single-needle entry into the caudal space if landmarks are clear on palpation. There are other tests to assure correct needle entry if anatomical difficulty is encountered and additives to prolong the duration of the local anesthetics. Real-time ultrasound use is useful in allowing the proceduralist to visualize the entry of the needle and the injected drug into the caudal space, but the setup and its use may prolong the caudal block procedure.</p></section>
