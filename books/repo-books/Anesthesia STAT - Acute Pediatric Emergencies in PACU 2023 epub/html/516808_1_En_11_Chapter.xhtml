His past medical history includes tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) type C repaired at birth, intermittent asthma (last asthma exacerbation 2 years ago), gastric esophageal reflux disease (GERD), and failure to thrive. He has undergone numerous esophagoscopies, dilatations for residual strictures, and biopsies as well as T&amp;A for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) under general anesthesia in the past with no complications. Patient has been treated with omeprazole, multivitamins, and albuterol at home. Patient’s vital signs in the preoperative area were unremarkable and nil per os (NPO) status was adequate. He underwent an esophagoscopy under general anesthesia with esophageal balloon dilatation and biopsy. Rapid sequence induction with propofol and rocuronium was performed; an oral endotracheal tube (6.5 mm) was placed without any complications. Maintenance of anesthesia was achieved with sevoflurane. Sugammadex was given at the end as a reversal agent and an uneventful awake extubation was performed after completion of the procedure. Patient was taken to the PACU, and his vital signs were the following: blood pressure 95/55, heart rate 98/min, oxygen saturation 99% on 4 Liters of O<sub>2</sub> blowby, respiratory rate 19/min, and temperature 36.4 °C.</p><p class="Para" id="Par3">Fifteen minutes after arrival to the PACU, the PACU nurse calls you urgently because the patient’s oxygen saturation has acutely dropped to 82–84%.

Neonates and younger infants are the most susceptible age group affected by these complications. Data has shown that pediatric patients with <span id="ITerm4">PRAE</span> and cardiopulmonary arrest had better outcomes whenever their care was supervised by trained pediatric anesthesiologists in pediatric centers when compared with the care provided by general anesthesiologists in mixed practices. In addition, these events are most seen on induction and recovery from anesthesia, and the main pathologic processes involved in the origin of <span id="ITerm5">PRAE</span> are laryngospasm, bronchospasm, severe persistent coughing, partial/complete airway obstruction, apnea, desaturation, and stridor among others.

Furthermore, <span id="ITerm7">PRAE</span> are associated with most reintubations, prolonged hospital stays, and unplanned admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU) which can negatively impact the healthcare revenue and increase medical expenditure. For instance, postoperative hypoxemia can be caused by medications utilized perioperatively: respiratory depressants (narcotics and opioids), volatile agents and neuromuscular blocking agents (depolarizing and non-depolarizing muscle relaxants), as well as respiratory pathologies (atelectasis) [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par10">This patient is high risk for <span id="ITerm8">PRAE</span> due to the past medical history of intermittent asthma (increased risk of laryngospasm and bronchospasm) and OSA (increased risk of partial or complete airway). It is important to consider not only the patient’s risk factors for desaturation but also the possible procedural risk factors that could be intimately involved with his current clinical presentation.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec3"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">3 </span>What Would You Do in This Clinical Scenario?</h2><p class="Para" id="Par11">First, airway patency assessment should be prioritized. It is necessary to look for airway secretions or foreign bodies to rule out possible aspiration or laryngospasm. If secretions are found in the airway, rapid oropharyngeal suction needs to be initiated, and simultaneously, 100% inspired oxygen needs to be administered. At this time, if airflow obstruction is witnessed, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) should be applied, and the placement of an oropharyngeal airway should be considered. Additionally, if laryngospasm is the possible diagnosis, forced jaw thrust and intravenous propofol should be given to deepen the level of anesthesia to break the laryngospasm. However, if these maneuvers are unsuccessful, intravenous succinylcholine must be given as soon as possible, and endotracheal intubation should follow if the clinical scenario abruptly deteriorates [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par12"><span id="ITerm9">Lung auscultation</span> should be rapidly performed, being the main goal to guarantee adequate air exchange and identify the presence of wheezes which can be associated with bronchospasm and aspiration. If bronchospasm is high on the differential, inhaled beta 2 agonists (albuterol) should be given rapidly. For the most part if this treatment is unsuccessful, titratable doses of intravenous epinephrine should follow. Magnesium sulfate and ketamine are treatment alternatives described in the literature as well [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par13"><span id="ITerm10">Upper airway obstruction</span> against a close glottis could produce an overwhelming elevation of the negative intrathoracic pressures increasing hydrostatic pressures and capillary permeability with ensuing leaking that will trigger the formation of negative pressure pulmonary edema. Therefore, this complication needs to be addressed acutely with measures to maintain airway patency and oxygenation, mechanical ventilation needs to be started in severe cases, and fluid restriction and diuretics should be considered as possible treatment options if improvement is not achieved [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par14">In case respiratory depression is high on the differential diagnosis, it is important to perform a pupil exam to rule out miosis that is a common finding in opioid overdose, and residual neuromuscular blockade should be assessed as well. If opioid overdose is suspected, intravenous naloxone needs to be given. If residual neuromuscular blockade is present, the use of reversal agents needs to be considered when these agents have not been given to the patient beforehand. In most cases if the airway is patent, and the lung auscultation is normal, other possible etiologies like atelectasis should be ruled out and rapidly addressed with the use of pulmonary toilet maneuvers and incentive spirometry. Additionally, postoperative atelectasis can be prevented with the use of positive end expiratory pressure intraoperatively [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par15">Alternatively, if the patient is presenting with stridor following endotracheal extubation, humidified mist, racemic epinephrine, and dexamethasone should be considered as treatment options for the possible diagnosis of postintubation croup [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>]. It is paramount to look for acute changes in the patient’s vital signs and rapid deterioration of the clinical status which is commonly associated with medical emergencies like tension pneumothorax, massive pulmonary embolism (PE), pericardial tamponade, or iatrogenic esophageal rupture that will require emergent surgical consultation and management.</p></section>

Nevertheless, patients with esophageal perforation with mediastinitis will require thoracic drainage using minimally invasive thoracoscopic approach [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par89">The successful management of esophageal perforation is multidisciplinary where radiologists, endoscopists, and surgeons are involved in the decision-making. In summary, the most common operative treatment options known are the following: drainage alone, decortication and drainage, primary repair with or without tissue aid, controlled tissue aid, controlled fistula formation with T-tube, esophageal resection, and esophageal exclusion [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></span>].</p></section>
