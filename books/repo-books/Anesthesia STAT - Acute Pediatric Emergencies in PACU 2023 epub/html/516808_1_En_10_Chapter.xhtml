He was induced with inhaled nitrous oxide and sevoflurane. An intravenous catheter was placed in the upper extremity. At first, a laryngeal mask airway was attempted; however due to airway obstruction and improper seating, patient was eventually intubated with rocuronium. Before the start of surgery, vancomycin was requested by the surgeon as antibiotic prophylaxis. After a test dose, the drug was infused slowly and vital signs were monitored closely. The rest of the surgery was uneventful, and patient was extubated awake without any issue. He presents to the PACU still recovering from his anesthetic. His breathing is a bit noisy with an occasional mild croupy cough. The croupy cough worsens after he wakes up and now, he is crying inconsolably. He is tachycardic and tachypneic and seems to have developed a red rash over his face, trunk, and limbs and as well as the erythema around his newly placed suprapubic catheter.

This leads to deformities of the spinal cord and vertebral column. Most occurrences of neural tube defect are isolated and multifactorial; however they can be associated with certain genetic syndromes, chromosomal abnormalities, nutritional deficiencies, or environmental exposures. The incidence of <span id="ITerm1">spina bifida</span> is highly variable across ethnicities, geographical locations, and genders. In the United States, the rate is approximately 0.2 per 1000 births and is more common in boys than girls. Across ethnicities, the highest rates are found in the Caucasian and Hispanic population [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>]. Folic acid deficiency during the first trimester has been linked to neural tube defects and spina bifida. The rates of <span id="ITerm2">neural tube defects</span> have dramatically decreased since folic acid supplementation and food fortification were implemented in the 1990s [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>].</p><div class="Para" id="Par33">Spina bifida can be <span id="ITerm3">classified</span> into three categories: occulta, meningocele, and myelomeningocele (Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">1</a></span>).<figure class="Figure" id="Fig1"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO1"><img alt="" aria-describedby="d64e380" src="../images/516808_1_En_10_Chapter/516808_1_En_10_Fig1_HTML.png" style="width:34.6em"/><div class="TextObject" id="d64e380"><p class="Para" id="Par58">A 4-part illustration. 4 diagrams illustrate the types of spines with neural tube defects.

As much 10–20% of the general population may have <span id="ITerm4">spina bifida occulta</span>.</p><p class="Para" id="Par35"><span id="ITerm5">Meningocele</span> is the rarest form of spina bifida characterized by the protrusion of a spinal fluid-filled sac or meninges without neural tissue through a vertebral defect. Meningocele accounts for about 5% of patients with spina bifida.</p><p class="Para" id="Par36"><span id="ITerm6">Myelomeningocele</span>, the most common and severe form, accounts for 75% or more of all spina bifida cases [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></span>]. In myelomeningocele, the spinal cord, neural tissue, and meninges protrude through the vertebral arch. The most common location is in the lumbosacral region; however it can occur anywhere along the spine.</p><p class="Para" id="Par37">Although some patients with spina bifida are symptoms-free, the majority of patients especially those with myelomeningocele have neurologic, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and urologic abnormalities. <span id="ITerm7">Common neurologic complications</span> include Arnold Chiari II malformation, obstructive hydrocephalus, and tethered cord. Intellectual disability occurs infrequently but can affect up to 20–25% of spina bifida patients. Patients with spina bifida usually have normal kidney functions; however sacral nerves S2–4 are almost always affected leading to neurogenic bladder, frequent urinary tract infections, vesicoureteral reflux, and hydronephrosis. Similarly, intestinal motility and rectal sphincter tone are affected in almost 90% of patients with spina bifida leading to constipation and fecal incontinence [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></span>]. The degree of musculoskeletal derangement depends on the level of the spinal defect. The higher the level, the greater the effect, ranging from minor mobility difficulties to complete paraplegia.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec4"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2.2 </span>Latex</h3><p class="Para" id="Par38">Latex is derived from the sap of the plant, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Hevea brasiliensis</em>. Natural rubber latex undergoes extensive manufacturing processes resulting in the final commercial and consumer product. Natural latex contains more than 240 polypeptides with at least 15 known allergenic proteins (Hev b 1 to 15). Spina bifida patients are primarily sensitized against Hev b 1 and b 3, while healthcare workers are primarily sensitized against Hev b 5 and b 6 [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></span>]. Latex allergy was first documented in the 1930s; however incidence peaked in the 1980s to 1990s when high protein content latex gloves were mass-produced to combat the HIV and hepatitis C epidemic [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR6" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></span>]. Latex proteins have also been found to have high cross-reactivity with certain fruits such as avocado, banana, kiwi, and chestnut. Patients with allergies to these fruits should be considered high risk for latex allergy as well [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par39">Latex has many <span id="ITerm8">beneficial properties</span> such as tear resistance, strong tensile, and elongation abilities making it ideal for many medical and household products. Latex can be found in a variety of medical products including gloves, catheters, tubing, tourniquets, blood pressure cuffs, and stethoscopes. With the rise of latex allergy, hospitals and medical facilities have moved away from latex products and often strive to provide latex-free environment for their patients. However, latex products are still widely used throughout the world especially in developing countries.</p><p class="Para" id="Par40">Symptoms of <span id="ITerm9">latex allergy</span> can range from contact dermatitis, GI upset, to full-blown anaphylactic shock. Latex sensitization occurs with direct contact with latex allergens or by inhalation of latex particles. The majority of latex allergies are type 1 hypersensitivity reactions. <span id="ITerm10">Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction</span> is an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated antibody release against the latex proteins leading to mast cell and basophil degranulation and release of mediators such as histamines, tryptases, prostaglandins, cytokine, and leukotrienes. These <span id="ITerm11">mediators</span> induce systemic effects such as vasodilation, bronchospasm, nausea/vomiting, mucosal edema, and tachycardia. This reaction is almost immediate and occurs usually within minutes of exposure. Very rarely patients may develop a delayed type 4 hypersensitivity reaction to latex. <span id="ITerm12">Type 4 hypersensitivity reaction</span> typically occurs 24–48 h postexposure and is mediated by activated T cells or macrophages leading to tissue inflammation and damage. Most of the delayed reactions are not due to latex proteins but due to other components and preservatives added during the manufacturing process.</p><p class="Para" id="Par41">Children with <span id="ITerm13">spina bifida</span> often have orthopedic, urologic, gastrointestinal, and neurologic abnormalities requiring multiple surgeries and procedures during their first few years of life. The repeated hospitalizations and exposure to latex allergens during surgeries and procedures increase the risk for latex allergy. The <span id="ITerm14">prevalence</span> of latex allergy in patients with spina bifida has been documented to be as high as 70% compared to just 1–2% in the general population [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">9</a></span>].</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec5"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2.3 </span>Anaphylaxis</h3><div class="Para" id="Par42">Anaphylaxis is a severe systemic hypersensitivity reaction characterized by rapid onset with life- threatening airway, breathing, and circulatory collapse with or without cutaneous or mucosal changes. The most common allergens to cause anaphylaxis in the perioperative settings are antibiotics, neuromuscular blocking agents, and latex. It can be difficult to identify the symptoms of anaphylaxis under general anesthesia, and there are a multitude of reactions that can mimic anaphylaxis. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic and is the most prescribed parenteral antimicrobial for treating methicillin-resistant <em><strong class="EmphasisTypeBoldItalic ">Staphylococcus aureus</strong></em> (MRSA) infections. <span id="ITerm15">Adverse effects</span> of vancomycin include nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and red man syndrome (RMS). RMS is secondary to histamine release and not due to a true IgE- mediated allergic reaction and therefore not a true allergy [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></span>].

There are many disorders that can mimic anaphylaxis in children. These include acute generalized urticarial or angioedema, asthma exacerbation, vasovagal syncope, panic or anxiety attack, foreign body aspiration, croup or epiglottitis, and other forms of shock. Once an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis is suspected, the first step is to remove the allergen from the patient if possible. Immediate assessment of airway, breathing, and circulation should be performed as death from anaphylaxis can occur within minutes after onset.</p><p class="Para" id="Par46">Epinephrine is the <span id="ITerm21">medication</span> of choice for the treatment of anaphylaxis. There are no absolute contraindications to the use of epinephrine in the setting of anaphylaxis. Epinephrine is a nonselective agonist to all adrenergic receptors and counteracts all the deleterious effects of anaphylaxis. It increases peripheral vascular resistance and decreases mucosal edema by stimulating the α1 receptors, improves cardiac output via activation of the β1 receptors, and reverses bronchoconstriction and stabilizes mast cells and basophils via the β2 receptors. Early epinephrine administration is vital in avoiding clinical progression toward cardiovascular collapse. Epinephrine can be administered intravascularly (IV) or intramuscularly (IM) in the anterolateral thigh. IM is preferred due to increased cardiovascular complications associated with IV dosing [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR16" role="doc-biblioref">16</a></span>]. There are currently three IM epinephrine auto-injectors available on the market with different dosing (0.1, 0.15, and 0.3 mg).</p><div class="Para" id="Par47">Dosage for IM <span id="ITerm22">epinephrine</span> is 0.01 mg/kg with a maximum of 0.5 mg. For infants less than 10 kg, 0.01 mg/kg is preferred. However, if it is not available, then 0.1 or 0.15 mg IM can be used. For children between 10 and 25 kg, 0.15 mg IM should be used. For children between 25 and 50 kg, 0.3 mg IM is indicated. For children greater than 50 kg, 0.5 mg IM should be used and if not available, then 0.3 mg IM can be used. However, there are instances where IV epinephrine is indicated such as when a patient is presenting with cardiovascular collapse or when the patient is refractory to IM epinephrine. IV epinephrine for anaphylaxis is dosed at one-tenth or less the dosing for cardiac arrest or 1 mcg/kg which may be repeated or titrated to restore blood pressure. Epinephrine dosing for children with anaphylaxis is summarized in Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab3">3</a></span>.<div class="Table" id="Tab3"><div class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Table 3</span><p class="SimplePara">Epinephrine dosing in children with <span id="ITerm23">anaphylaxis</span></p></div></div><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col class="tcol1 align-left"/><col class="tcol2 align-left"/><col class="tcol3 align-left"/><col class="tcol4 align-left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Route</p></th><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Weight</p></th><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Preferred dosing</p></th><th style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Alternative option</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">IM</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">&lt;10 kg</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">0.01 mg/kg</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">0.1 or 0.15 mg auto-injector</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"> </td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">10–25 kg</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">0.15 mg auto-injector</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"> </td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"> </td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">25–50 kg</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">0.3 mg auto-injector</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"> </td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"> </td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">>50 kg</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">0.5 mg</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">0.3 mg auto-injector</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">IV</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">All weights</p></td><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; text-align: left;"><p class="SimplePara">Slow bolus 1 mcg/kg or one-tenth the dosing for cardiac arrest</p></td><td style="text-align: left;"> </td></tr></tbody></table><div class="TableFooter"><p class="SimplePara">Adopted from ref.

For infants and children, epinephrine infusion dosing is 0.02–0.2 mcg/kg/min titrated to target blood pressure. A central <span id="ITerm24">line</span> is preferred when administering epinephrine infusion; however its placement should not delay the initiation of the infusion. In rare cases where refractory hypotension does not respond to epinephrine, other vasopressors such as vasopressin, dopamine, and norepinephrine may be considered. If the patient is in cardiovascular collapse with no pulse, begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and follow the <span id="ITerm25">Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) algorithm</span>.</p><p class="Para" id="Par49">Large-bore IV <span id="ITerm26">access</span> should be obtained in all cases of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can cause massive fluid shift via vasodilation and increased vascular permeability. IV fluid resuscitation should be started immediately for hypotensive patients and those not responding to IM epinephrine. Balanced crystalloids are preferred as the first-line resuscitation fluid. Children should receive 10–20 mL/kg initial bolus which can be repeated as needed while monitoring for signs of volume overload.</p><p class="Para" id="Par50">Initial airway <span id="ITerm27">assessment</span> should include signs of angioedema to the face, lips, tongue, and uvula, listening for airway stridor, and evaluating for signs of respiratory distress. To assess for peri-glottic edema, patients should be asked to phonate and observed for hoarseness or changes in their voice. Supplemental oxygen should be started on all patients suspected of anaphylaxis. Airway assessment is crucial in determining if the patient requires emergent intubation as angioedema and upper airway compromise can deteriorate rapidly. Intubation may be difficult due to the severity of the upper airway edema and distortion of normal anatomy and landmarks. Difficult airway cart along with video laryngoscopes and fiber-optic scope should be immediately available. For older patients, awake fiber-optic intubation could be tried; however for younger patients it may not be a feasible option. If difficult airway is suspected, maintaining spontaneous ventilation during induction of anesthesia is important to prevent complete airway collapse. In severe cases of angioedema, otolaryngologist should be consulted and present during intubation in the event rigid bronchoscopy or emergent cricothyroidotomy is needed to secure the airway.</p><p class="Para" id="Par51">Adjunct treatments for <span id="ITerm28">anaphylaxis</span> include H1 antihistamines, H2 antihistamines, beta 2 adrenergic agonist, and glucocorticoids. These medications can be used to treat specific symptoms of anaphylaxis but should not be used as first-line, sole therapy, or replacement for epinephrine. H1 antihistamines such as diphenhydramine may be used to treat cutaneous symptoms such as flushing and pruritus and improve patient comfort. The dosing for diphenhydramine is 1 mg/kg IV with a maximum single dose of 50 mg which may be repeated up to daily maximum of 200 mg or 5 mg/kg. H2 antihistamines such as famotidine can be used to treat pruritus and GI symptoms. The dosing for famotidine is 0.25 mg/kg with a maximum of single dose of 20 mg. However, H2 antihistamines play a minor role in the treatment of anaphylaxis [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR18" role="doc-biblioref">18</a></span>]. Beta 2 agonist such as albuterol can be used to treat bronchospasm and mild respiratory symptoms via metered dose inhaler or nebulizer. Glucocorticoids such as methylprednisolone are commonly given during allergic reactions or anaphylaxis; however their onset of actions may take 4–6 h. The dosing for methylprednisolone is 1 mg/kg with a maximum single dose of 125 mg. They may be beneficial to patients with history of asthma, significant bronchospasm, or airway edema. However, they are nonspecific and slow acting with many adverse side effects and should not be used to treat acute anaphylactic reactions.</p><p class="Para" id="Par52">All patients with <span id="ITerm29">anaphylaxis</span> should be monitored until all related symptoms have resolved. There is currently no consensus on how long these patients must be observed for. The observation period should be individualized and tailored to the severity of the allergic reaction. Some studies recommend at least 4–8 h observation after resolution of symptoms [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR19" role="doc-biblioref">19</a></span>]. Anaphylaxis can be biphasic in which there is a recurrence of symptoms after apparent resolution of the initial episode. The incidence of biphasic anaphylaxis can be as high as 14.7% in pediatric anaphylaxis and is associated with more severe initial presentation and those requiring more than one dose of epinephrine. Recurrences usually develop within 12 h of initial onset; however up to 72 h have been reported [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR20" role="doc-biblioref">20</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR21" role="doc-biblioref">21</a></span>]. Patients with severe anaphylaxis or those requiring multiple doses or infusion of epinephrine should be admitted and observed in the intensive care setting for an extended period. For patients to be discharged, there should be an emergency action plan in place, epinephrine auto-injector dispensed with instructions, and follow-up with an allergist or primary care physician.</p></section>
<section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec7"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2.5 </span>Prevention of Latex Allergy</h3><p class="Para" id="Par53">Primary <span id="ITerm30">prevention</span> is aimed at avoiding or decreasing exposure to latex allergenic proteins and preventing sensitization. Since the 1990s and the rise of latex allergy, governmental agencies and medical establishments have been moving away from latex-containing products and providing latex-free environment for patients. Latex gloves particularly high protein powdered latex gloves were targeted and replaced by powder-free low protein latex gloves, ultimately leading to the ban by the FDA on all powdered gloves in 2016. There has also been a push for novel manufacturing protocols and chemical processes to reduce the allergenic proteins in natural latex products. Other synthetic materials such as nitrile, neoprene, and polyvinyl are now widely used in the manufacturing of surgical and examination gloves. These changes have dramatically decreased the incidence of latex sensitization. In addition, the development of latex awareness, education, protocols, and policies have been crucial in the fight against latex allergy. Intra-op management includes assuring a latex-free environment. Even a needle entry via the rubber cap of a vial to draw medication can lead to an allergic response in sensitized patients.</p><p class="Para" id="Par54">Personnel taking <span id="ITerm31">care</span> of the patient should be aware of personal items such as watches, necklaces, and bracelets which may have potential to contain latex allergen.</p><p class="Para" id="Par55">Secondary prevention focuses on eliminating latex exposure to high-risk or known patients with latex sensitization and avoiding the development of an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. Screening of the general population for latex sensitization is not cost-effective as the prevalence is only 1–2%. However, screening for high-risk patients may be indicated. There are several tests used to identify latex sensitization, the most common test being the skin prick test. Serum IgE levels can also be measured to confirm suspected latex allergy with no risk for anaphylaxis. The disadvantages of IgE testing are the increased cost and prolonged waiting period. Provocation testing or challenge test involves exposing a patient to suspected allergen under controlled setting to determine the severity of the reaction. For patients sensitized to latex, the best prevention is to provide a latex-free environment during their hospital stay.</p><p class="Para" id="Par56">When patients with latex allergy are inadvertently exposed to latex, there should be a root cause analysis to determine the cause. Root cause analysis is used to review the events in chronological order and discover systemic failures leading to the event. Failures may include improper identification of at-risk patients, unclear labels on products containing latex, or miscommunication between healthcare professionals. Once the issue is found, there should be discussion between the stakeholders in rectifying <span id="ITerm32">the</span> cause by ensuring latex allergies are clearly documented and displayed, labeling equipment with latex components, educating stakeholders on latex allergy, developing a checklist, and finally providing reporting tools for near misses and adverse events. In addition to spina bifida patients, it is important to recognize the possibility of latex sensitization in other pediatric patients with congenital malformations who had undergone multiple corrective surgeries soon after birth. Prophylactic measures should be taken in these children as well to avoid perioperative latex anaphylaxis [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR22" role="doc-biblioref">22</a></span>].</p></section>
</section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec8"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">3 </span>Conclusion</h2><p class="Para" id="Par57">Although the incidence of latex allergy has declined in the recent years, it remains an important allergen especially in spina bifida patients. Latex products are continuously being replaced by alternatives; however due to its availability and cheaper cost, it remains widely used worldwide. In the event a sensitized patient comes into contact with latex, it is imperative to be able to recognize the signs and symptoms of latex allergy and successfully manage patients with anaphylaxis.</p></section>
