He has no drug allergies but has seasonal allergies and takes oral budesonide at home and albuterol as needed. He underwent an uneventful anesthetic induction with inhalational anesthetic and had an intravenous line placed for fluids and infusion of propofol for maintenance of anesthesia. The only difficulty was when the oral bite block was placed, the patient had a bout of coughing which was treated with a bolus of propofol. The remainder of the case proceeded without any problems.</p><p class="Para" id="Par3">The anesthesiologist reports to the PACU nurse during the handoff that he underwent an uneventful mask induction and easy mask ventilation, followed by spontaneous ventilation with nasal cannula oxygen while the anesthetic was maintained with a propofol infusion through a left-hand peripheral intravenous line. The patient had tolerated the procedure well and he was brought to the PACU lying on his side with the nasal cannula and in a clinically stable condition. In PACU his vital signs are stable and he is sedated, still lying on the left lateral side with oxygen flowing via the nasal cannula.</p><p class="Para" id="Par4">After 15 min in the PACU, the patient is awake spontaneously and the nasal cannula is pulled out by him on awakening. The PACU nurse notices that he has a persistent dry cough. On examination there are bilateral breath sounds with no wheezing and all vital signs are stable on room air. As the patient takes sips of apple juice, his parents notice a missing front tooth. They would like to see this tooth.</p><p class="Para" id="Par5"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">The PACU nurse calls you to the bedside and asks for your assessment</em>.</p></section>

A thorough examination of the mouth should be compared with the preoperative dental exam. Two universal systems are used to identify primary teeth and <span id="ITerm1">permanent teeth</span><span id="ITerm2"/>. The first system designates 20 primary teeth. <span id="ITerm3">Primary teeth</span> may be referred to as milk teeth or baby teeth. Primary teeth are identified by a sequence of letters starting with the primary maxillary right second molar designated tooth A and continuing alphabetically to the contralateral teeth of the maxilla ending on the left second molar, tooth J. The mandibular teeth then continue from the primary mandibular left second molar, tooth K, all the way around to the mandibular right second molar, tooth T. The second system to identify teeth is a numeric system designated for 32 permanent teeth. This numeric system begins with the maxillary right third molar and then continues around the mouth in the same fashion as the primary teeth (Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">1</a></span>) [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>].<span id="ITerm4"/><figure class="Figure" id="Fig1"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO1"><img alt="" aria-describedby="d64e349" src="../images/516808_1_En_6_Chapter/516808_1_En_6_Fig1_HTML.png" style="width:33.45em"/><div class="TextObject" id="d64e349"><p class="Para" id="Par41">A labeled diagram of primary and permanent teeth. The label on the top reads tooth eruption chart.

Around age 6–7 years, the primary teeth will begin to erupt usually starting with the “6-year molars” which are permanent teeth 3, 14, 19, and 30. Children frequently start to lose primary teeth beginning around age 6 or 7.</p><p class="Para" id="Par22">The missing tooth has been identified as the primary right lateral incisor (tooth D). The child’s parent suggests that since it is “just a baby tooth,” they are not very concerned. They were initially disappointed that they could not get the tooth to take home to put under his pillow but are not alarmed about its possible other location. The parents ask if it is safe for him to be discharged home now that the coughing seems to be less.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec3"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">3 </span>What Is the Appropriate Response You Should Give the Parent?</h2><p class="Para" id="Par23">The missing tooth must first be identified within the oropharynx, the gastrointestinal tract, or the respiratory tract to determine whether it is safe or not to be discharged. If a tooth is lost during induction of anesthesia, then laryngoscopy may assist with visualization and extraction of the foreign body from the oropharynx. Laryngoscopy while the patient is under anesthesia may also be useful if the tooth becomes dislodged during placement of an oral airway or from a rigid bite block during endoscopy cases.</p><p class="Para" id="Par24">The incident in the past in our institution about a missing tooth during the procedure was quite different. In this case everyone was aware of a loose front tooth and its loss was discovered shortly after introduction of the endoscope. This was prompted by the endoscopist’s question “where is all the blood in the mouth coming from?”. In answer to this unexpected query about the etiology of bleeding, the anesthesiologist asked the endoscopist to pause so she could check on the loose front tooth. A front tooth was missing, and the bleeding source was from the base of the avulsed tooth. At this juncture it was important for the OR team to focus on retrieving this tooth that was detached and has the risk of entering the respiratory tract in this anesthetized patient. The endoscopist looked first in the stomach and then in the esophagus as he pulled the scope back, and after pulling it back into the mouth, he looked around slowly but was unable to locate it mainly because the blood obscured his vision despite repeated suctioning. The anesthesiologist decided then to put her gloved finger into the patient’s mouth blindly feeling for a tooth and fortunately encountered it in the molar area in the dependent part since the patient was lying in the left lateral position. It was extracted manually intact to everyone’s relief and the endoscopist was able to complete the procedure.</p><p class="Para" id="Par25">If a tooth is not retrieved from the oropharynx, then a chest x-ray should be completed. Both PA and lateral view of the chest films must be obtained to avoid any ambiguity as to whether a foreign body is in the respiratory versus gastrointestinal tract. A tooth in the GI tract should naturally pass and will not necessitate endoscopy. However, a tooth in the respiratory tract presents risk of chronic irritation, cough, infection, and obstruction. Patients with <span id="ITerm6">tooth aspiration</span> present with a variety of symptoms including nonproductive cough, dyspnea, wheezing, hemoptysis, or cyanosis [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>]. As a result, an aspirated tooth must be safely retrieved by a specialist qualified to perform bronchoscopy for foreign body removal.</p><div class="Para" id="Par26">PA and lateral films have identified the tooth within the right side of the lung. A surgeon is consulted to assist with removal. Imaging from a different patient demonstrates teeth <span id="ITerm7">fragments</span> in the right lung (Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2">2</a></span>).<figure class="Figure" id="Fig2"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO2"><img alt="" aria-describedby="d64e400" src="../images/516808_1_En_6_Chapter/516808_1_En_6_Fig2_HTML.png" style="width:23.02em"/><div class="TextObject" id="d64e400"><p class="Para" id="Par42">An X ray of the chest.

Although <span id="ITerm10">ASA fasting guidelines</span> recommend 2 h for clears, there has been debate over the evidence to liberalize these guidelines to 1 h for pediatric patients [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></span>]. By the time the chest x-ray has been completed and interpreted by the radiologist, 1 h has passed since clears were ingested. <span id="ITerm11">Risks and benefits</span> of proceeding at this point should be agreed upon by the surgeon and anesthesiologist and should be made on a case-by-case basis. If the patient at any point developed respiratory distress, then it would be prudent to proceed emergently to the operating room for rigid bronchoscopy regardless of the NPO status. Although unlikely from a primary tooth, foreign bodies may be at risk to cause more complete occlusion as they move proximally within the airway. The case proceeded with IV induction. He received albuterol for bronchodilation as well as dexamethasone to alleviate swelling in the oropharynx due to repeated instrumentation from EGD and rigid bronchoscopy. Intravenous ondansetron was administered prophylactically to prevent post-op nausea. The surgical team retrieves the tooth uneventfully. The patient was extubated awake given the repeated instrumentation to the oropharynx from multiple procedures on a single day.</p><p class="Para" id="Par29">The parents are thankful that there were no major issues from the aspirated tooth. Two weeks later there are an incident report in your email inbox and a request to attend a root cause analysis meeting to discuss safety concerns regarding perioperative dental injuries.</p></section>

A survey of 133 anesthesiology training programs reported an average incidence of 1:1000 dental injuries during or after over one million tracheal intubations in a year [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par31">Congenital craniofacial anomalies associated with cleft palates, Treacher Collins syndrome, Pierre Robin sequence, and Goldenhar syndrome may lead to difficult intubations increasing risk of dental injury. <span id="ITerm14">Congenital dental anomalies</span> like amelogenesis imperfecta or dentinogenesis imperfecta also lead to increased risk of dental fracture since even the slightest airway manipulation may injure the tooth [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par32">Patients with neurologic impairments or Down syndrome also are at higher <span id="ITerm15">risk</span> of aspiration of foreign <span id="ITerm16">bodies</span> because of decreased gag reflex or other problems with airway protective mechanisms. They may also have delayed diagnosis if they do not complain of their symptoms, if they present with nonspecific symptoms, or when they are asymptomatic. The case report of a 4-year-old boy with Down <span id="ITerm17">syndrome</span> who aspirated his maxillary incisor during a dental extraction procedure should be a caution to everyone not to assume that the missing tooth is in the stomach without radiological confirmation prior to discharge. Since this young child had shown no signs of respiratory distress, he was sent home without a diagnosis of the tooth’s location only to be readmitted through the ER because of pneumonia from the aspiration of that tooth into his respiratory tract. After general anesthesia for two bronchoscopies, the foreign body or tooth in the bronchial tree was eventually extracted. The case report signifies the importance of obtaining a radiological confirmation of the tooth location in the stomach after it was seen missing during the procedure prior to discharge [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>].</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec5"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">5 </span>What Should Be Done to Prevent Perioperative Dental Injury?</h2><p class="Para" id="Par33">Although many <span id="ITerm18">perioperative</span> dental injuries may be minor and easily repaired, these injuries are estimated to make up one third of all medicolegal anesthetic claims. Dental injury is the adverse <span id="ITerm19">event</span> responsible for the greatest number of malpractice claims brought against anesthesiologists [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></span>]. In order to prevent harm to patients and avoid an increasingly litigious medicolegal environment, the anesthesia team should conduct a thorough preoperative dental evaluation. Identifying and documenting which teeth may be loose or damaged and documenting this is essential. Especially loose teeth should be evaluated with a glove by the anesthesiologist to test the degree of mobility and formulate a plan of action. Poor dentition may not only put teeth at risk for avulsion or aspiration, but untreated dental abscess can contribute to extended postoperative treatment and potentially compromise surgical outcome. If an area of the mouth is concerning for infection, then the patient should have a dental consult prior to proceeding with an elective case. The need to establish a heightened awareness of dental abnormalities like loose, chipped, and missing conditions cannot be overemphasized. Documentation of the preoperative dental condition and the potential perioperative risk <span id="ITerm20">factors</span> regarding these may help reduce medicolegal expenses from claims of dental damage that can arise after an uneventful anesthetic. Anesthesiologists should document the intactness of the teeth after laryngoscopy, intubation, and extubation to protect him-/herself from legal conundrums at a later stage [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par34">Dental injuries include enamel fracture, subluxation (loosening of the tooth), luxation (partial displacement of tooth from socket), avulsion (complete displacement of the tooth from the socket), or crown and root fractures. In addition, damages to fillings, crowns, permanent dentures, bridges, and veneers are all possible as a consequence of airway manipulation [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par35">A review of over 160,000 cases in a 14-year time period identified that dental injury occurred in 1 per 2073 anesthetics. Perianesthetic dental <span id="ITerm21">injury</span> was defined as any significant change to the patient’s dentition during the perianesthetic period that may or may not have required dental consultation or treatment. Factors predictive of <span id="ITerm22">dental injury</span> associated with anesthesia were patients that had poor dentition or reconstructive work as well as those patients considered to be moderately difficult to intubate. Patients with poor dentition and who are moderately difficult to intubate are at a 20-fold higher risk of dental injury. Maxillary central incisors were the most likely teeth to be injured according to this case-control study [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par36">Since it is not practical to obtain a dental consultation for every loose tooth prior to surgery, a discussion of the risk of dental injury should occur preoperatively. Discussing these risks with parents and patients in the presence of another medical professional before surgery and documenting this conversation or modified informed consent will reduce dissatisfaction should inadvertent dental complications occur [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par37">Some practitioners suggest a loose tooth may be secured with a silk suture and taped to the ipsilateral cheek so in the event it becomes dislodged during airway manipulation, it will not be lost [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR6" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></span>]. If tooth extraction is discussed with parents preoperatively, then many pediatric anesthesiologists will remove “extremely mobile” primary teeth after induction of anesthesia. A gauze barrier should be placed lingually to prevent accidental introduction of the tooth more distally. Then another gauze should be used to help extract the tooth using a twisting and snapping action [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par38">A review of <span id="ITerm23">foreign body aspiration (FBA)</span> in 157 children over a 10-year period showed that most children with FB aspiration were diagnosed accurately. In 80% of cases despite a history of witnessed choking, only 46% were diagnosed early (within 24 h). The clinical triad of wheezing, coughing, and diminished breath sounds was more prevalent in late diagnoses (47%) (later than 24 h) than in early diagnoses (31%). Right-sided FB were more common (56%) than left-sided FB aspiration (35%) [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></span>]. A witnessed choking event is the most important historical information to make an early diagnosis of FBA [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></span>]. Diagnosis of foreign body location can be made by radiography and CT scan, and a rigid bronchoscopy is necessary to retrieve the foreign body under general anesthesia. Complications from bronchoscopic retrieval include bronchial irritation, tracheitis, atelectasis, and pneumonia if the FB has been lodged for a long time [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">9</a></span>]. Rigid bronchoscopy is the gold standard procedure for removal of pediatric airway foreign bodies [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par39"><span id="ITerm24">Dental injury</span> can occur during direct laryngoscopy (DL). In a recent review of adult patients, DL was found to cause a higher rate of dental injury (4.86%) compared to suspension laryngoscopy (1.7%) by an otolaryngologist. The use of a dental guard and the technique and tools used may explain this difference [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR12" role="doc-biblioref">12</a></span>].</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec6"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">6 </span>Summary</h2><p class="Para" id="Par40">Dental injury from anesthetic care causes patient dissatisfaction, added medical expenses, additional procedures, and harm to patients. Understanding dental anatomy and physiology will help the anesthesia team conduct a more thorough preoperative dental examination. Identifying patients with preoperative dental anomalies should alert the team to take additional precautions and care during airway manipulation. During endoscopy procedures, the entire team should be aware of loose teeth to ensure that placement of the bite block and the endoscope is performed with caution. In addition, checking for the presence and intactness of known loose teeth is essential before the completion of the procedure. Dental guards should be considered to avoid dental injury in cases where difficult laryngoscopy and intubation are anticipated.</p></section>
