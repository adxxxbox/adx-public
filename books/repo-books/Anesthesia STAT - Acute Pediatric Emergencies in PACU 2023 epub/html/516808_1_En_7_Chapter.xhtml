<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec4"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">4 </span>Discussion</h2><p class="Para" id="Par26"><span id="ITerm14">Acute leukemias/lymphomas</span> are the most common malignancy in children, with a peak incidence between age 2 and 5 years old. Common presenting symptoms include lymphadenopathy, organomegaly (liver and spleen), fever, and musculoskeletal pain [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>]. Young children may be diagnosed after a new-onset limp is discovered. Anemia and thrombocytopenia may present as pallor and bruises or petechiae. Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and poor platelet function and coagulopathy is very common. It is therefore important in these children to obtain a history of bleeding from the gums on brushing teeth or spontaneous epistaxis. Since children with childhood leukemias often require multiple anesthetics for diagnostic and treatment procedures, pediatric anesthesiologists should familiarize themselves with the multisystem involvement of each child’s malignancy to minimize complications related to anesthesia. This includes a thorough airway evaluation for possible obstruction due to edema from chronic steroids or lymphadenopathy. Decreased pulmonary compliance and increased resistance due to disease burden or cytokine release can be present. <span id="ITerm15">Cardiomyopathy</span> can occur in children treated with cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic agents such as Adriamycin. <span id="ITerm16">Electrolyte disturbances</span> can result from renal dysfunction or from cellular response to chemotherapy. Most importantly, the presence of a mediastinal mass from lymphoma can rapidly lead to severe airway obstruction, cardiac compression, low cardiac output, and sudden death with the induction of anesthesia and administration of muscle relaxants. <span id="ITerm17">Mediastinal lymph node enlargement</span> can clinically present with dyspnea and inability to lie flat and sometimes with superior vena caval obstruction [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR2" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></span>]. Visceromegaly with abdominal distension can cause respiratory difficulties and oxygen desaturation on room air due to a decrease in functional residual capacity (FRC) especially when supine.</p><p class="Para" id="Par27">Children with new-onset rapidly dividing tumors such as non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma specifically Burkitt’s lymphoma and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) are at risk for the development of <span id="ITerm18">TLS</span> which can occur spontaneously or after the initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy. <span id="ITerm19">Massive tumor cell lysis</span> will result in the release of large amounts of potassium, phosphate, and nucleic acids into the systemic circulation. This can rapidly lead to hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia which can progress to acute renal failure, seizures, and cardiac arrest [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></span>]. The most common cause of acute renal failure in <span id="ITerm20">TLS</span> is due to the precipitation of uric acid crystals in renal tubules which occurs when breakdown of tumor cells by chemotherapy releases uric acid and causes the formation of uric acid crystals in the renal tubules and collecting ducts [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR4" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par28">The diagnosis of tumor lysis <span id="ITerm21">syndrome</span> requires that two or more of the metabolic abnormalities, such as hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia, occur within 3 days before or up to 7 days after the initiation of therapy. Acute renal failure is initiated by precipitation of uric acid and calcium phosphate as well as renal vasoconstriction. Clinically this is accompanied by an increased serum creatinine level, seizures, cardiac dysrhythmia, or death. The rapid increase in serum potassium levels can quickly lead to cardiac dysrhythmias, including torsade de pointes. Hyperphosphatemia leads to secondary hypocalcemia, which can cause neuromuscular irritability dysrhythmia, and seizures. Large amounts of uric acid crystal precipitation can occur during <span id="ITerm22">TLS</span> due to lack of an enzyme called urate oxidase which is inactive in humans. The significance of <span id="ITerm23">urate oxidase</span> is that it helps in the formation of allantoin—the end product of purine oxidation—and prevents the buildup of excess uric acid which can result in acute kidney injury.</p><p class="Para" id="Par29">Finally, the release of large amounts of cytokines from dying cancer cells can cause a systemic inflammatory response which can cause multisystem organ failure, including <span id="ITerm24">acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)</span> [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR3" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></span>–<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR5" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></span>].</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec5"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">5 </span>Immediate Postanesthetic Events in PACU</h2><p class="Para" id="Par30">In the recovery room, the child initially <span id="ITerm25">presented</span> with increased work of breathing, likely due to alveolar infiltrate from ARDS related to the release of cytokines. The child was managed appropriately by increasing respiratory support and an early decision to reintubate the child due to increased work of breathing and altered mental status. A stat portable chest X-ray showed bilateral fluffy infiltrates in all lung fields. The appropriate medications for reintubation in this child would be to avoid drugs which significantly decrease systemic vascular resistance and myocardial contractility in the setting of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. A better choice than propofol for intubation would be medications such as ketamine, etomidate, or fentanyl which have less effect than propofol on systemic vascular resistance.</p></section>

Sodium bicarbonate administration can move potassium intracellularly, especially in the setting of metabolic acidosis, and should also be given promptly. Administration of insulin with dextrose to prevent <span id="ITerm30">hypoglycemia</span> can acutely move potassium intracellularly in addition to albuterol. Long-term <span id="ITerm31">management</span> of chronic hyperkalemia involves administration of loop diuretics such as furosemide and sodium polystyrene which remove potassium from the body via the kidney and intestine, respectively [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR7" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></span>]. This patient developed ventricular fibrillation which likely resulted from QRS widening onto the T waves, causing an R on T phenomenon. Management of <span id="ITerm32">ventricular fibrillation</span> includes early initiation of CPR and defibrillation as soon as possible at 2 J/kg followed by 4 J/kg. If ventricular fibrillation persists, then amiodarone 5 mg/kg IV bolus for up to three doses should be considered [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR8" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></span>]. If reversible causes of the cardiac arrest are present, they should be treated immediately. In this case the patient had the reversible cause of severe hyperkalemia due to tumor lysis syndrome. This should be <span id="ITerm33">managed</span> as soon as possible before considering the administration of amiodarone since stabilization of the myocardium by calcium administration will increase the likelihood of a successful subsequent defibrillation.</p><p class="Para" id="Par42">Children with underlying malignancies are at high risk for complications with anesthesia. A case report of a child with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia developing <span id="ITerm34">TLS</span> after being given dexamethasone for antiemetic prophylaxis during a bone marrow biopsy is a reminder that this drug is probably best avoided in children who are at risk for developing <span id="ITerm35">TLS</span> [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR9" role="doc-biblioref">9</a></span>]. There are case reports of <span id="ITerm36">TLS</span> hastened by radiation therapy, use of thalidomide, dexamethasone, and the use of newer chemotherapeutic agents like rituximab and bortezomib [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR10" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></span>]. Studies on the use of <span id="ITerm37">imatinib,</span> a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor effective in the treatment of ALL, have shown that it can induce rapid apoptosis and <span id="ITerm38">TLS</span>. The conclusion by the authors was that preventive measures for <span id="ITerm39">TLS</span> should be taken for patients with high leukemia burden on imatinib therapy and vigilant monitoring of parameters of <span id="ITerm40">TLS</span> should begin at the early phase of therapy [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR11" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></span>].</p><p class="Para" id="Par43">The rapid increase in biologic and targeted <span id="ITerm41">therapies</span> against malignancies has led to an increase in the incidence of <span id="ITerm42">TLS</span>. Assessment of risk and prevention of <span id="ITerm43">TLS</span> must include early awareness, initiation of prophylactic measures, and continuous laboratory monitoring in high-risk patients. Once <span id="ITerm44">TLS</span> is diagnosed, aggressive treatment should begin with administering intravenous fluids to expand the intravascular volume and correction of electrolyte abnormalities with hypouricemic agents. Rapid administration of intravenous <span id="ITerm45">fluids</span> to improve urine flow and treating the hyperuricemia with allopurinol and rasburicase (brand name Elitek—a uric oxidase) may help avoid the onset of acute renal injury.

Membrane stabilizers like calcium gluconate have an immediate onset and the effect lasts for 30–60 min. Shifting the potassium ions into the cell can be accomplished by intravenous insulin push with dextrose solution which has an onset of 20 min and duration over 4–6 h. Beta-agonists like albuterol also push potassium intracellularly when nebulized with normal saline with an onset of 30 min and effective duration for 2 h.
