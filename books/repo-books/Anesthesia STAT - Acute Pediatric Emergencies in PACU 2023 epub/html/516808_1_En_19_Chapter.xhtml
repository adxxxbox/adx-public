She had developed group b strep at 17 days of life, with multiple cerebral vascular accidents. She has developed some drooling recently and was scheduled for an ENT consult for a selective Botox injection near her salivary gland. She prefers a soft diet now and has had episodes of gagging after solid food. She presents for <span id="ITerm2">Botox injection</span> for management of her multiple limb spasticity. She has undergone many Botox injections in the past, but her parents noticed that she was getting more anxious and afraid of these procedures and strongly requested oral premedication with midazolam, which was given in the past. Therefore, she was given 20 mg of oral midazolam before the procedure. Her weight is 34.2 kg, with an ASA Classification of class 2-mild systemic disease.</p><p class="Para" id="Par10">She was taken to the procedure room with her parents and induced by mask after the placement of monitors. Anesthesia for <span id="ITerm3">Botox injections</span> included an inhalation induction with nitrous oxide and sevoflurane. After placement of a peripheral intravenous catheter, propofol 70 mg was administered, and a <span id="ITerm4">laryngeal mask airway (LMA)</span> was placed without difficulty. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane and spontaneous ventilation. After <span id="ITerm5">Botox injections</span> were completed, the LMA was removed deep. Some secretions were noted in the mouth, and the oropharynx was suctioned. The patient was transported to the <span id="ITerm6">postoperative care unit (PACU)</span> in the lateral position breathing oxygen via a Jackson-Rees circuit.</p><p class="Para" id="Par11">Initial vital signs in the recovery were stable with a pulse oximetry of 98%, HR 94/min with blood pressure 95/56. During handoff to the PACU nurse, the patient developed hiccups and started coughing, and the pulse oximeter reading decreased to 95% and then 90%. Oxygen was being delivered via a facemask placed close to the patient’s face. The patient was coughing and retching and developing clinical signs of upper airway obstruction and beginning to look dusky. A <span id="ITerm7">Yankauer suction</span> was used to suction out copious secretions in the mouth, which looked pink like the oral premedication that was given to her.</p><p class="Para" id="Par12">After her mouth was suctioned, the anesthesiologist attempted to assist her breathing, but it was impossible to move air into her trachea and lungs because of suspected glottic closure. Since the laryngospasm could not be overcome with positive pressure, intravenous succinylcholine was administered with a rapidly improved ability to ventilate. Her ventilation was controlled during the period of apnea from the succinylcholine, and her oxygen saturation improved to 98%.</p><p class="Para" id="Par13">Ten minutes after <span id="ITerm8">succinylcholine administration</span>, the patient showed no signs of respiratory effort but had developed an increased heart rate of 125/min and blood pressure of 120/70. Fifteen minutes after succinylcholine, blood pressure had increased to 140/85, and HR had increased to 140/min. An <span id="ITerm9">ulnar nerve stimulator</span> was placed, and the train-of-four yielded no twitch.</p><p class="Para" id="Par14">Apnea after anesthesia has several etiologies, including lingering effects of anesthetic agents such as propofol, opiates, or benzodiazepines. Systemic spread of Botox in a child with cerebral palsy can rarely result in weakness, respiratory distress, or apnea.</p><p class="Para" id="Par15"><span id="ITerm10">Pediatric laryngospasm</span> is a life-threatening event and can be defined as total glottic closure due</p><p class="Para" id="Par16">to reflex constriction of the laryngeal muscles. <span id="ITerm11">Laryngospasm</span> can be complete or partial</p><p class="Para" id="Par17">and occurs in a state of decreased inhibition of <span id="ITerm12">glottic reflexes</span> with increased stimulation. Common causes of increased stimulation are extubation, secretions or blood irritating the vocal cords, an artificial airway, or a suction catheter. This glottic closure can lead to hypoxemia, negative-pressure pulmonary edema, pulmonary aspiration, and cardiac arrest.</p><p class="Para" id="Par18">Treatment may initially begin with physical methods such as jaw thrust, immediate application of positive-pressure ventilation, and administration of 100% oxygen.</p><p class="Para" id="Par19"><span id="ITerm13">Pharmacologic interventions</span> have long included succinylcholine because of its rapid onset and short duration of action. <span id="ITerm14">Succinylcholine</span> is administered at a dose of 1–2 mg/kg and given with atropine (0.02 mg/kg) to prevent bradycardia. This results in a duration of effect of 5–10 min following a standard dose. Therefore, a period of apnea is expected after administration. When intravenous access is absent, succinylcholine can be administered intramuscularly at a dose of 4 mg/kg. The agent that is commonly used to break laryngospasm currently is intravenous propofol. <span id="ITerm15">Propofol</span> has been reported to relieve laryngospasm in most cases effectively. Its use can avoid the need for paralysis and the potential side effects of succinylcholine.</p><div class="FormalPara FormalParaRenderingStyle3" id="FPar2"><div class="Heading">Questions</div><div class="Para FirstParaInFormalPara" id="Par20"><div class="OrderedList"><ol><li class="ListItem"><div class="ItemNumber">1.</div><div class="ItemContent"><p class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild" id="Par21"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">How did she develop hiccups and laryngospasm after an uneventful anesthetic?</em></p></div><div class="ClearBoth"> </div></li><li class="ListItem"><div class="ItemNumber">2.</div><div class="ItemContent"><p class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild" id="Par22"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Could she have developed apnea from the multiple Botox injection?</em></p></div><div class="ClearBoth"> </div></li><li class="ListItem"><div class="ItemNumber">3.</div><div class="ItemContent"><p class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild" id="Par23"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Could she have developed an unusual reaction to the Botox or phenol injection?</em></p></div><div class="ClearBoth"> </div></li><li class="ListItem"><div class="ItemNumber">4.</div><div class="ItemContent"><p class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild" id="Par24"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">What is the cause of apnea immediately after treatment of laryngospasm in PACU with succinylcholine?</em></p></div><div class="ClearBoth"> </div></li><li class="ListItem"><div class="ItemNumber">5.</div><div class="ItemContent"><p class="Para ParaOneEmphasisChild" id="Par25"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Could the use of propofol avoided this apnea?</em></p></div><div class="ClearBoth"> </div></li></ol></div></div></div><p class="Para" id="Par26">This patient most probably has a rare condition of pseudocholinesterase deficiency that affects 1 per 2000–5000 people.

<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec2"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2 </span>Cause of Laryngospasm</h2><p class="Para" id="Par27">It was clear that <span id="ITerm16">as </span>she emerged slowly from her anesthetic after reaching PACU that she had vomited and had developed laryngospasm from the copious secretions in her mouth, which included her oral premedication of midazolam 20 mg (volume 10 cc). Children with cerebral palsy commonly have feeding disorders and dysphagia that place them at risk for aspiration with oral intake, with potential pulmonary consequences.</p><p class="Para" id="Par28">Removal of the LMA deep was well tolerated at the end of the procedure in the OR. She exhibited good respiratory effort initially because she had no respiratory depression from any drugs given during the case. <span id="ITerm17">Intravenous Tylenol</span> managed her pain, and she had not received any narcotics intraoperatively. The patient arrived in the PACU in the lateral position, but on emergence she spontaneously turned supine, but she was not sufficiently conscious to cough to expel the secretions in her mouth. She was therefore at risk for pulmonary aspiration and laryngospasm. Children with CP are usually positioned in a lateral or recovery position as they emerge from anesthesia to keep their airway clear and open and thus improve respiratory efforts. It also ensures that any vomit or secretions will drain by gravity to the side of the bed and not be aspirated into the airway. <span id="ITerm18">Laryngospasm</span> in PACU is usually treated with propofol. In this scenario, succinylcholine was the only drug readily available to treat the laryngospasm in the anesthesiologist’s hand.</p><p class="Para" id="Par29"><span id="ITerm19">Pseudocholinesterase deficiency</span> is an important consideration in patients who develop prolonged apnea after succinylcholine is administered. These patients cannot effectively metabolize the muscle relaxants succinylcholine, mivacurium, and ester type of local anesthetics. Using a muscle relaxant such as succinylcholine to relax the apposed vocal cords during laryngospasm, which is <span id="ITerm20">normally</span> short acting, can lead to prolonged paralysis of several hours following its administration. Given the use of succinylcholine and the patient’s otherwise unremarkable history, pseudocholinesterase deficiency was the possible diagnosis.</p><p class="Para" id="Par30">After breaking the <span id="ITerm21">laryngospasm</span> and improvement in <span id="ITerm22">oxygen saturation</span> with manual ventilation by mask, an endotracheal tube was placed, and ventilation was controlled with 100% oxygen. The patient’s temperature was 37.1. Point-of-care testing revealed normal potassium, mild respiratory acidosis (pH, 7.26; carbon dioxide, 52 mmHg; oxygen partial pressure, 328 mmHg; bicarbonate concentration, 19.4 mmol/L; base excess, −4.2 mmol/L).</p><p class="Para" id="Par31">Fifty-five minutes after arrival in the PACU, endotracheal tube suction slightly increased her blood pressure and heart rate, but spontaneous respiration and movement were not observed.</p><p class="Para" id="Par32">The patient’s body temperature was 37.3 C, and her serum potassium level was within the normal range.</p><p class="Para" id="Par33">Three hours and 30 min after the arrival in the PACU, the patient showed slight diaphragm and eyelid movement and mild coughing. Four and a half hours after the PACU arrival, the patient regained consciousness with sustained head lift and adequate spontaneous ventilation. The patient was extubated and admitted for overnight observation to PICU and was discharged the next day in stable condition. A blood sample was submitted to measure serum pseudocholinesterase level. This specialized testing was sent to a reference laboratory and revealed a dibucaine number of 22. Family members were also counseled to receive testing. The parents are grateful that this genetic defect in enzyme function was diagnosed and wanted to know how their daughter will be identified as having this deficiency without an identifying marker.</p><p class="Para" id="Par34">Their question prior to discharge was an important one.</p><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec3"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2.1 </span>What Is the Ideal Safe Way for Their Daughter to Undergo Future Anesthesia for Botox Injection?</h3><p class="Para" id="Par35">The anesthesiologist and the PMR physician went over the medical problems that she was developing of drooling and <span id="ITerm23">dysphagia </span>and aversion to solid food as she manifested signs of diminished gag reflex and inability to have strong cough to clear her own salivary secretions. In this setting, perhaps oral premedication may not be ideal for her to have as a premedication drug for calming her.</p><p class="Para" id="Par36">The choice of other avenues of preoperative relaxation was suggested including listening to her favorite music or distractions with children’s movies and games that the hospital child life specialists frequently use, which may be better tolerated by her to allay her anxiety prior to the next <span id="ITerm24">Botox procedure</span>. TIVA with propofol supplemented with intravenous Tylenol for pain relief could be beneficial if she can breathe well spontaneously with a nasal cannula in place. The most important information they needed to hear was that their daughter’s inability to swallow well may put her at risk for general anesthesia by mask or LMA in the future, and so intravenous drugs which will not depress her ventilation could be tried with a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery and a CO<sub>2</sub> monitor side port for evaluating adequacy of her ventilation. If the PMR physician could tolerate her position in the bed slightly tilted to the side position, then it would be advantageous and safer to undergo the next procedure with TIVA.</p></section>

It is a neurotoxin produced by the bacterium <span id="ITerm27"><em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Clostridium botulinum</em></span> and inhibits neuromuscular transmission to nicotine acetylcholine receptors by blocking the presynaptic fusion of acetylcholine-containing vesicles and, thus, muscle activation. By exerting chemodenervation effects at the presynaptic nerve terminal [<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="biblioref" href="#CR1" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></span>], it is effective in pathologies that present with atypical improper muscle contractions. The release of acetylcholine at cholinergic nerve endings is blocked after the neurotoxin is injected into muscle to progress to a temporary denervation and atrophy. Its therapeutic effectiveness was first demonstrated for the management of strabismus and now encompasses treatment of multiple muscular abnormalities. Botox has been effective in treating pathologies of the head and neck and gastrointestinal, urogenital, musculoskeletal, neurological, gynecologic, rheumatologic, and cosmetic disorders (Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">1</a></span>).

The patient’s medical record should be updated to reflect the diagnosis of pseudocholinesterase deficiency. Future anesthetics should avoid administration of succinylcholine and mivacurium to avoid prolonged neuromuscular blockade and possibly respiratory failure. Family members of patients with <span id="ITerm49">pseudocholinesterase deficiency</span> are encouraged to undergo laboratory testing due to a strong genetic component associated with inheriting an abnormal variant of the pseudocholinesterase gene.

Frequent episodes of care such as medical procedures and hospitalization can be emotionally traumatizing for pediatric patients. The provider should provide age-appropriate and developmentally appropriate information to the patient to combat heightened anxiety levels. No oral premedication should be administered to this patient at high risk for aspiration. Parental presence, music, child life specialists, and virtual reality technologies can help the child cope better with induction.</p><p class="Para" id="Par47">Consider using an S-Caine patch to start and an intravenous line (iv) while the patient is awake rather than induction with a mask, as in a patient with a full stomach. Inhalation induction in the lateral position with the placement of an iv and LMA while maintaining spontaneous ventilation can also be successful. It is important to be cautious during the removal of the LMA to avoid hiccups and vomiting. Maintain the lateral position en route to the PACU, and if laryngospasm occurs, use propofol. During handoff, specify the need for the lateral position with a pillow at the back of the patient to maintain that position.</p></section>
<section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec6"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">5 </span>Summary</h2><p class="Para" id="Par48">The anesthesiologist will often encounter patients with cerebral palsy for various surgical procedures, including Botox injection. Children with CP may be at increased risk for aspiration during general anesthesia by mask if they have developed dysphagia complications from Botox injections. An appropriate anesthetic plan and sedation-analgesic strategy are critical for safe management. Though a rare condition, <span id="ITerm51">pseudocholinesterase deficiency</span> may lead to prolonged paralysis and fatal complications. <span id="ITerm52">Supportive care</span> should be provided when the diagnosis is suspected, and a PChE level and dibucaine number should be obtained. Good communication with the patient and family is essential, including offering genetic testing to the patient and to all the members of the family.</p></section>
